wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>The idea of cars silently signaling each other through walls is as futuristic as it sounds, but many electronics suppliers want to get going on it as soon as possible. </p> <p>On February 22, Qualcomm <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualcomm-and-leading-automotive-companies-across-the-globe-drive-the-commercialization-of-c-v2x-300602527.html" target="new">revealed</a> a long list of companies looking to use its 9150 C-V2X chipset, which is due to be demonstrated this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and shipped commercially in the second half of this year. The list includes well-known names such as BMW, LG Electronics, Continental, Sierra Wireless and ZTE. </p> <p><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/technologies/lte/advanced-pro/cellular-v2x" target="new">C-V2X</a>, or cellular vehicle-to-anything, is a way to use cellular radios in cars to communicate with other vehicles, pedestrians&apos; phones, and roadway infrastructure such as traffic signals and warning signs. One use of C-V2X would be to notify cars approaching a blind intersection that there&apos;s a speeding vehicle around the corner that&apos;s about to run a red light. </p><p>It&apos;s important for many different suppliers to join in on a technology like C-V2X, because it can&apos;t deliver benefits like safety unless a lot of things use the same system. Vendors from different industries all need to sign on. </p><p>C-V2X uses 5G technology and is designed as one element of a complex set of sensors and networks, including Lidar and radar, that may someday keep self-driving cars informed about everything around them. Before that, C-V2X might help to keep manually driven vehicles from crashing into each other. </p> <p>Automotive wireless networks such as C-V2X are starting to overcome the limits of human vision and robotic line of sight. With wireless signaling, cars can virtually see each other even where drivers can&apos;t and respond appropriately. In the example of the red-light runner at a blind corner, vehicles approaching the intersection could automatically brake or warn drivers to brake. If the traffic light had the right wireless radio, it might send a warning to the oncoming car or even stop it from running the red. </p><p>C-V2X isn&apos;t the only way to make all this work. There&apos;s also a wireless LAN standard related to WiFi that&apos;s used in technologies such as WLANp and Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC). Volkswagen Group <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">announced</a> earlier this month that it would equip all its European cars with WLANp beginning next year. The US government has been pushing DSRC for several years. Qualcomm also has products in this category. </p><p>But Qualcomm says it has a global ecosystem of automakers, component suppliers, software companies and system integrators committed to C-V2X and the 9150 chipset. They include participants in China, South Korea, Japan, Germany, France and the US. </p> <p>One of the selling points for C-V2X is that it could build on the 5G mobile ecosystem and take advantage of carriers&apos; cellular networks. In addition to direct wireless links among cars and nearby infrastructure like signs, C-V2X can connect cars to the larger cellular network. Those vehicle-to-network links could be used for services like traffic and hazard warnings, locations of parking spots, and streaming information and entertainment. </p><p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

With Internet of Things (IoT) and newer technologies, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, revving up the automotive industry, the connected car is giving commuters newer ways to make rush hour more relaxing or productive.</p><p>Today&apos;s consumer is connected in three places -- their home, their office and their local coffee shop -- with evidence of companies shifting from connected car pilots to programs, connected cars are quickly steering their way into the becoming the "third place."</p><p>For a long time now, Starbucks has been known as a third place with its goal to provide all the comforts of home and office while enjoying a cup of coffee with friends and colleagues. </p><p>The convergence of data, device and design, as well as advances in telematics, sensor technologies, in-vehicle infotainment and the cloud, will continue to shape the future of cars, making them ready to adopt more end-to-end technology solutions to provide newer ways to connect the home, office and casual driving experiences.</p><p>Let&apos;s dig deeper into what is driving this momentum.</p> <b>Creating the ultimate experience</b><br/>Today, the automobile industry is changing at breakneck speed. The cars we drive are changing, and so are the ways we commute.</p><p>The initial excitement is often overshadowed by uncertainty and reluctance to try something new. The focus on user experience (UX) is driving a profound shift in how connected cars are envisioned. In fact, UX is fast becoming the defining strategy of every company shifting toward the connected car market share. Forward-thinking UX holds up a mirror to the future that is a perfect "third place."</p><b>Evolving the continuum – digital lifestyles & cars</b><br/>Mechanical excellence is no longer the battleground for automakers. To create meaningful innovations and capture consumers&apos; interest in digital lifestyle, automakers must strive to understand users and care about their lives.</p> <p>It is all about building less of a machine and more of a car as a companion.</p> <p>This evolution will require a collaboration between those who understand and advocate for the user and those who strategize and integrate the technology. Together, they will create cars of the future.</p><b>Putting data in the driver&apos;s seat</b><br/>Cars are increasingly becoming data powerhouses as they become ever more connected and empowered by smart, IoT technology.</p> <p>The richness of insights is unlocking a digital gold rush around the connected car, transforming vehicles to be as unique as the people in them. The ability to carry out predictive, machine-learning driven analytics across datasets is creating huge potential for innovation. Putting this data in the driver&apos;s seat of the connected car will enhance the comfort and convenience of commuters.</p> <b>Bringing new levels of connectivity to the car</b><br/>The automobile industry is a part of the same revolution that fuels our desire to stay connected -- anywhere, anytime. Connectivity is no longer an option, it is a key feature in turning your car into a customized extension of yourself.</p><p>Be it Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) or even Vehicles-to-Phones, the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology incorporates connectivity into, well, everything.</p><b>Software is the new hardware</b><br/>We no longer have "car companies" -- these businesses are increasingly turning into software giants. Software-based platforms, of which AI-based technologies are a part, tend to make every aspect of the connected car more essential and also more valuable.</p><p>There are two key imperatives to get ahead of this inevitable disruption.</p><p>The first is user-centered design, or UCD.</p> <p>UCD is an amalgamation of design and science with the goal of making products and services user-desirable, business-viable and technologically feasible. Factor in behaviors, preferences, context, goals and aspirations while defining the connected car strategy.</p> <p>Ask questions, build uses cases, personalize the experience. What is their "Job-To-be-Done?" What are their priorities? Are they doing five other things at the same time? How can the car help improve their lifestyle?</P><p>The second is collaboration and co-creation.</p><p>Whether it is be it incremental or breakthrough innovation, the concept of siloed genius dies hard.</p><p>Although it is imperative for automakers to leverage their independent expertise and clout, isolated actions lead to a fragmented experience.</p><p>Too many existing companies have evolved into silos of expertise. To succeed, leveraging partnerships and participating in ecosystems becomes crucial for automotive manufacturers, suppliers and service providers.</P><p>The next few years will be an incredibly creative period. The cars we drive will change more than they have in the last century and become the true third place.</p><p><i>— Mohan Krishnaraj is the global head of user experience at Harman, a Samsung company</i>.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Connected Cars Edging Toward &apos;3rd Place&apos;' --post_excerpt='For years, people had three connected places they could go: Their home, their office and their local coffee shop.

Under the proposed law, local governments couldn&apos;t impose their own regulations.</p><p>Utah is the 13th largest state by area, spanning sparsely populated deserts and snowy mountains -- a particular challenge for fledgling robot drivers -- as well as the sprawling Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The bill&apos;s chief sponsor, Rep. Robert Spendlove, a Republican from Sandy, says it could help the state&apos;s growing technology sector to take the lead in self-driving cars, according to the <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/02/22/utah-soon-could-be-first-state-to-fully-legalize-self-driving-cars-on-its-roads/" target="new">Salt Lake Tribune</a>.</p><p>Supporters say allowing self-driving cars will help to make roads safer because robot cars don&apos;t run red lights, drive drunk or text while driving. (Surveys suggest consumers <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">haven&apos;t quite bought</a> the safety argument yet.) </p><p>Spendlove&apos;s bill would set up a standard way for owners to register and insure autonomous cars. It would also make sure crashes are handled the same way when there&apos;s no driver behind the wheel: The self-driving car would have to remain at the scene, just like a human driver does, and the car&apos;s owner would have to report the crash. </p><p>The bill will define different rules for each level of autonomous technology, from Level 1 systems like adaptive cruise control to future Level 5 vehicles that won&apos;t need a driver, pedals or a steering wheel. </p><p>Though it mostly amends existing laws, it&apos;s an ambitious measure on a technology that&apos;s still evolving and controversial. Spendlove has said he may put off the bill&apos;s effective date until the middle of next year to allow for more work on it. </p><p>The promise of tech investment and the prospect of driverless vehicles hitting the road in the next few years are leading many states to craft laws and programs to deal with these cars. This month, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Massachusetts and Indiana</a> have debated autonomous vehicle regulation and the District of Columbia has created an agency to prepare for testing and other developments. Legislatures in five states have passed laws on autonomous vehicles, and 30 others have considered legislation, according to the <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Automated_Driving:_Legislative_and_Regulatory_Action" target="new">Center for Internet and Society</a>.</p> <p>Some proponents of the technology say the growing patchwork of laws could hamper the industry, and the federal government is trying to step in with <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">national regulations</a>. But states that step forward may stand to gain. </p> <p>Arizona, which is home to some chipmaking operations but not one of the country&apos;s biggest tech or car hubs, has become a hotbed of self-driving activity since its governor gave an executive order on autonomous vehicles in 2015. Late last month, the state gave Alphabet&apos;s Waymo subsidiary <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">license to operate</a> a car-for-hire service with its driverless minivans.

The most common communication methods are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I).</p><p>V2V communication involves one vehicle being able to inform other vehicles within a given proximity of important decisions it makes, while V2I communications involve sending information to, and accepting information from, traffic infrastructure, such as a traffic signal informing a vehicle of a red light.</p><p>Led by Benedetto Piccoli, associate provost for research at Rutgers University-Camden, the study found a single autonomous vehicle can control the flow of at least 20 human-controlled vehicles around it, with substantial reductions in excessive braking and fuel consumption.</p><p>The research comes as the use of a small number of GPS-equipped vehicles in the traffic stream has increased dramatically, changing how traffic is monitored.</p><p>Though gathering this real-time traffic data previously required predominantly fixed sensing infrastructure, recent advancements in vehicular automation and communication technologies provide new possibilities and opportunities for traffic control.</p><p>For example, when a series of adjacent vehicles on a roadway are connected and automated, it is possible to form dense platoons of vehicles which leave very small gaps, in theory eliminating the stop-and-go waves that form so-called "phantom" traffic jams.</p><p>"AVs can revolutionize the control of traffic flow," the report noted. "They offer the potential to shift from localized control measures, like ramp metering, and centralized ones, as variable speed limit gantries, to actuators immersed in the traffic stream."</p><p>While the presented ring experiments represent a stretch of single-lane roadway, the theory also extends to multi-lane freeways, on which lane-changing can serve as an additional trigger of stop-and-go waves.</p><p>The findings were presented to policymakers in Washington, DC at an exhibit at the Washington Auto Show, including US Sen. John Thune, chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.</p><p>"Most of the policymakers, car manufacturers, car dealers, and others we talked with were very impressed with the research results and got a positive feeling about autonomous vehicles," Piccoli <a href="https://news.camden.rutgers.edu/2018/02/study-shows-autonomous-vehicles-can-help-improve-traffic-flow/" target="new">told</a> Rutgers-Camden News Now.

Arizona issued the permit on January 24, according to <a href="https://qz.com/1208897/alphabets-waymo-googl-is-readying-a-ride-hailing-service-in-arizona-that-could-directly-compete-with-uber/" target="new">Quartz</a>.</p><p>Waymo says it plans to launch the service this year and has <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">ordered</a> "thousands" of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans for its fleet. It&apos;s testing the technology in five states and has been offering free rides in a trial program in Phoenix since early last year.</p><p>Last November, Waymo sent minivans out without safety drivers to take over if the vehicle made a mistake. </p> <p>The upcoming service will put the Google juggernaut into the ride-hailing business against Uber and Lyft, and with a game-changing technology advantage that neither rival has developed quite to the point Waymo has reached. Robotic taxis without drivers could slash the cost of rides for consumers and dramatically increase the scale of ride-hailing services -- if local, state and federal laws allow it and there are no collisions that raise safety alarms with the public and regulators.</p><p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">predicted</a> last week that self-driving cars would reduce the cost of the average ride from $2.50 per mile to $1 per mile. </p><p>Fear of Google muscling its way into the industry led Uber to hire some of Google&apos;s top automotive engineers in 2016, making the acquisition that led to Waymo and Uber&apos;s recent court battle that was <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">settled</a> earlier this month. In 2013, the two companies had formed a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">partnership</a> to combine Google&apos;s cars with Uber&apos;s ride-hailing platform, but that deal died of Google&apos;s neglect, according to Uber founder Travis Kalanick. </p>  <p>Still, the race among the three companies is more complex than a pure rivalry. Google Ventures invested more than $250 million in Uber in 2013, Alphabet put $1 billion into Lyft last year, and Waymo won a $245 million stake in Uber in this month&apos;s settlement. Alphabet may not want to enter the ride-hailing business all over the world, given the massive resources that would take, industry analyst Bob O&apos;Donnell of Technalysis Research said earlier this month. Waymo might end up part of either rival company. </p><p>Meanwhile, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/uber-ceo-hopes-to-have-self-driving-cars-in-service-in-18-months/" target="new">hopes</a> to put autonomous cars into commercial service within 18 months, and Lyft announced a self-driving ride <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16742924/lyft-nutonomy-boston-self-driving-car" target="new">pilot in Boston last year and offered <a href="https://jalopnik.com/my-ride-in-a-self-driving-lyft-showed-how-far-autonomou-1822029612" target="new">demonstration rides</a> with different partner during International CES in Las Vegas last month. </p> <p>If autonomous ride services like these catch on, they may help save the environment. </p> <p>On Tuesday, oil giant BP <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/bp-sees-self-driving-electric-vehicles-squeezing-oil-demand-by-2040.html" target="new">predicted</a> that a combination of electric vehicles, shared mobility services and self-driving cars could reduce the use of oil for cars by 2040 -- or at least keep it from growing. BP&apos;s annual long-range forecast predicted the world&apos;s cars will use 18.6 billion barrels per day (bpd), down from 18.7 billion bpd in 2016. </p> <p>The company expects a boom in shared, autonomous vehicles in the 2030s, with most of those vehicles having electric drivetrains because they require less maintenance. </p> <p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Uber has brought its publicly available tool for viewing and analyzing Uber trip information to its hometown of San Francisco.</p><p>The tool, called <a href="https://movement.uber.com/cities" target="new">Uber Movement</a>, provides large sets of data about the trips that Uber cars make, along with tools for crunching that data. Anyone with an Uber account can use it. It&apos;s designed to help city officials and the public study traffic trends and predict how events or changes might affect mobility around the region. </p> <p>Uber released Movement for the San Francisco Bay Area on January 30, about a year after it was introduced. The tool is already available for at least three other cities -- Boston, Cincinnati and Washington, DC -- and the company has said it plans eventually to make it available for all cities where Uber operates. </p> <p>Uber has been at odds with many cities since it started disrupting taxi services and transit in 2009. But the very popularity that makes Uber look like a threat to some city agencies also gives it great visibility into the day-to-day transportation experience. As a single entity providing a large percentage of the trips made in cities, Uber can uncover a lot of information about how well the road network operates. </p><p>Uber says Movement provides planners with better, fresher information than they can get from traditional studies, which may be years old and not as comprehensive. Plus, the data and analysis are free and easily available online, a boon to both professionals and ordinary citizens. </p><p>Movement data is anonymized so users can&apos;t see who took each trip, Uber says. Its main function is to show how long trips took between one area and another during a given time period, date range, or day of the week. For example, if a construction project blocked one lane of a street for a week, Movement could show how much that slowed down drivers who traveled through that part of the city. In some cases, trip data could even help to reveal where potholes are.</p> <p>The tool is one step toward making Uber a part of cities&apos; overall transportation systems rather than just a provider of cars for hire. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi described this ambitious goal in a speech to an investment banking conference last week. </p><p>"I want to run the bus systems for a city," Khosrowshahi said, according to <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/14/17014762/uber-softbank-dara-khosrowshahi-goldman-sachs" target="new">Recode</a>. He also envisions Uber trips that combine modes of transportation, such as a subway ride to a station where a car -- or a bike -- is waiting for the rider to travel the last mile to their destination. </p><p>Some municipalities are already integrating ride-hailing services into their transportation plans. Five cities in central Florida now offer <a href="https://www.altamonte.org/736/Uber" target="new">discounted Uber rides</a> as a form of public transit. But in many places, Uber&apos;s relationship with transit is tense and competitive. To some, the multiple-passenger service UberPool looks alarmingly like a replacement for public buses.

Automakers and regulators are weighing the two alternatives for V2X, which is expected to improve safety and traffic flow. </p><p>VW will provide WLANp as standard equipment at no extra cost on all its personal and commercial vehicles. It says the move will help create a broad network of information on traffic risks and promote accident-free driving. Volkswagen Group is one of the largest automakers in the world, with <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/volkswagen-group-achieves-record-sales-in-2017/a-42177892" target="new">2017 sales</a> of 10.7 million vehicles.</p><p>V2X can help cars "see" each other even where buildings or other vehicles block the view, including around corners and in highway passing situations. It has a range of hundreds of meters and can reach farther than the radar and Lidar systems being built into driverless cars. </p> <p>If one car is about to run a red light and another is nearing the intersection at a blind corner, V2X in both cars could generate an alert -- or make either car stop, depending on how much automation was built into the cars. It could also send a signal from one car to the vehicles behind it when the brakes are applied so they can automatically slow down or generate a driver alert. </p><p>V2X links could also help vehicles see pedestrians with mobile devices and communicate with infrastructure like traffic lights and warning signs. Wirelessly linked trucks could form convoys that roam the highways together to run more efficiently.</p><p>(Think speed control to maintain a safe distance, not drivers conspiring over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy_(song)" target="new">CB radio</a>.) </p><p>But while regulators and industry generally agree on the potential for V2X, there&apos;s less harmony over what system to use. </p><p>WLANp is based on IEEE 802.11p, part of the standard behind WiFi. Its proponents say the technology is tested and ready to go. Regulators in both the US and Europe have used it in developing standards for future cars and infrastructure and have set aside similar frequencies for the radios to use. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has proposed requiring an 802.11p-based system called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) in all US vehicles. All these steps could help clear the way for wireless LANs to show up in all new vehicles and infrastructure. </p><p>But recently, some major automotive tech suppliers have started to say cellular, or C-V2X, may be the best, fastest, and most secure way to go. Cell-based systems, especially with upcoming 5G capabilities, could work better than wireless LANs and ride the massive wave of cell-chip manufacturing to low cost and wide availability, they say. </p>  <p>Qualcomm, which <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/qualcomm-steadfast-supporter-dsrc-sees-c-v2x-providing-clear-path-forward" target="new">already makes</a> 802.11p chips, is <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/technologies/lte/advanced-pro/cellular-v2x" target="new">promoting</a> C-V2X as a technology for both communication between cars (on those dedicated frequencies) and links to cellular networks. The 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), which includes Audi, BMW, Daimler and the biggest cell network suppliers, plus Qualcomm and Intel, is also pushing for this approach. </p><p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

I can even be a good provider, once I get these self-driving cars and developing markets going. </p> <p>Khosrowshahi confirmed what much of the world has been saying about the company, which he took over in August after a string of scandals knocked founder Travis Kalanick out of the top job and reshaped Uber&apos;s board. </p> <p>"We have a long way to go, but we have to re-earn our consumer and driver trust," Khosrowshahi told the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/ubers-dara-khosrowshahi-we-have-a-long-way-to-go-to-regain-user-trust.html" target="new">CNBC</a>.

Consumers&apos; view of the company has been "appropriately negative," Khosrowshahi said. </p> <p>That&apos;s done more than make the new CEO feel bad. Uber&apos;s ride-hailing market share fell from 82% to 70% in the fourth quarter of last year, which was Khosrowshahi&apos;s first at the helm. </p><p>But in the same quarter, the nine-year-old startup also trimmed its ongoing losses, according to reports about the selected <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">financial details</a> the privately held company shared on a conference call with investors on Tuesday, February 13.

Uber will keep investing in Asia, and driverless cars are the only way to eventually make rides cost $1 per mile, he said. They cost about $2.50 per mile today. </p><p>The autonomous car effort got a shot in the arm last week when the company <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">settled</a> a lawsuit by rival Waymo after four days in court.

But excluding legal expenses and some other costs, such as stock-based compensation and taxes, the loss was only $2.2 billion. </p> <p>A week ago, Uber was facing a $1.8 billion trade-secrets lawsuit by Waymo in a case that set a record for packing lawyers into Judge William Alsup&apos;s federal courtroom in San Francisco. Each side had nine attorneys on hand for the <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">opening arguments</a>.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">settlement</a> reached last Thursday ended what was expected to be a three-week trial, as Uber gave Alphabet&apos;s autonomous car business a $245 million equity stake and a commitment not to use the company&apos;s trade secrets. Waymo had accused Uber of using eight stolen hardware secrets in a frantic bid to catch up in driverless cars. </p><p>Self-driving cars are cool, but they&apos;re also a key part of Uber&apos;s financial future, holding out the prospect of running its ride-hailing business without drivers. That would eliminate both a huge portion of Uber&apos;s costs and a part of its business that has led to controversy and legal battles. </p><p>"This war for self-driving is truly existential for Uber: we&apos;ll either start up our second S curve of growth or we&apos;ll die," Uber Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden wrote in an email to then-CEO Travis Kalanick in 2016 that was presented as evidence in the trial. </p><p>The ultimate business model of the money-losing company, founded in 2009 and now worth an estimated $68 billion, may depend on driverless cars. Uber is taking in more money than ever. In last year&apos;s fourth quarter, its net revenue was $2.22 billion, up 61% from a year earlier, Bloomberg reported. Sales for the whole year reached $7.5 billion, up from about $6.5 billion in 2016. </p><p>The company&apos;s losses may be narrowing. For 2016, it reported an adjusted net loss of $2.8 billion, excluding results from its China business, which was sold off in July of that year. Still, the company ended 2017 with less cash than it started with: $6 billion, down 13% from the end of 2016. </p><p>Things may be looking up for Uber, which went through a dramatic and public meltdown last year over its internal culture and alleged spying practices.</p><p>In June, Kalanick resigned as CEO under pressure, though he remained on the company&apos;s sometimes contentious board. Dara Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia executive, took over as CEO in August. In late December, Uber sold a 15% stake to Japan&apos;s SoftBank Group, reportedly at a discount to its $68 billion valuation.

Those reports showed how often safety drivers had to take over the cars because their self-driving systems failed or didn&apos;t respond correctly to what was going on around them. </p> <p>Congress shouldn&apos;t allow self-driving cars on the road if they can&apos;t actually drive themselves yet, the group said. </p><p>"As it stands, this piece of legislation gives self-driving car manufacturers full authority in deciding whether or not the vehicles they manufacture are prepared to roam the streets without human supervision," the letter said. </p><p>Sen. John Thune of South Dakota proposed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/srpt187/CRPT-115srpt187.pdf" target="new">AV START Act</a> in November. For now, the bill is stalled because three Senate Democrats, including California&apos;s Dianne Feinstein, have placed holds on it. Safety provisions are key concerns for them. </p> <p>The bill would update federal vehicle rules for vehicle safety in order to help get self-driving cars on the road. After three years, it would allow the US Department of Transportation to give exemptions for up to 80,000 autonomous vehicles per manufacturer. The bill would require manufacturers to submit safety reports, but based on a voluntary safety assessment proposed by the Department of Transportation. </p> <p>The act is also intended to keep autonomous car regulation from becoming a mishmash of different state laws while the DoT formulates new federal rules. </p><p>Consumer Watchdog says the AV START Act wouldn&apos;t create meaningful regulation or a way to verify that self-driving cars actually work. </p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">2017 reports</a> from California, which allow autonomous vehicle testing but require companies to report things like accidents and test-driver interventions, showed all companies that tested cars ran into cases where safety drivers had to take over. Twenty companies filed reports. </p><p>Waymo&apos;s cars <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/42aff875-7ab1-4115-a72a-97f6f24b23cc/Waymofull.pdf" target="new">went furthest</a> without human intervention, going an average of 5,596 miles before a driver had to take over. The automotive arm of Google parent Alphabet reported 63 incidents in 352,545 miles. In testing by most other companies, the cars went only a few hundred miles between incidents. </p> <p>Drivers had to take over because the cars executed unwanted maneuvers, incorrectly predicted what other drivers and pedestrians would do, didn&apos;t perceive their surroundings correctly, or lost their GPS signals, among other things. In some cases, the self-driving cars appeared headed for a collision when the driver intervened. </p> <p>California hasn&apos;t yet allowed cars to hit public streets without a safety driver, though it has drafted rules that might allow it. But in Arizona, where regulation is more lax, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Waymo</a> has tested truly driverless cars on public roads and plans to launch a driverless ride-hailing service this year. </p><p>Cities, states and the federal government are all looking to regulate aspects of autonomous vehicles. On Tuesday, Washington, DC, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">launched an effort</a> to get self-driving tests going in some parts of the district. Indiana lawmakers are currently <a href="http://wbaa.org/post/industry-groups-divided-self-driving-car-regulations-bill" target="new">considering</a> a state law that would supersede tighter local restrictions. But the DoT and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) traditionally have taken the lead in regulating vehicles in the US. </p> <p>Congress is trying to catch up with the growth of autonomous cars. Last September, the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving/u-s-house-unanimously-approves-sweeping-self-driving-car-measure-idUSKCN1BH2B2" target="new">passed</a> a bill similar to the AV START Act that would let manufacturers deploy as many as 25,000 cars without meeting current safety standards in the first year, rising to 100,000 after three years.</p><p>The Trump administration has indicated the president supports the bills. </p><p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles are going to get presidential treatment in Washington DC as the city&apos;s mayor is paving the way to embrace these technologies.</p><p>On Monday, February 12, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a new agency that will help prepare the city, its residents as well as the streets, for autonomous vehicle testing and other developments. The Interagency AV Working Group is made up of representatives from other city agencies that focus on transportation, disability rights, environmental issues and public safety.</p><p>The agency&apos;s first task is to create a proposal to test autonomous and self-driving vehicles on 10th Street, SW, near the L&apos;Enfant Plaza.</p><p>"We will keep the District on the cutting edge of autonomous vehicles and do so in a way that benefits our residents," said Mayor Bowser in a <a href="https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-establishes-autonomous-vehicle-working-group" target="new">statement</a>. "Washington, DC is a creative, tech-savvy city, and as we grow, we will always be exploring and investing in innovation and finding ways to make it more inclusive."</p><p>The new agency is also working with the city&apos;s Southwest Business Improvement District, which works to improve and maintain about 483 acres within the southwest part of Washington, <a href="https://www.swbid.org/" target="new">according to its website</a>.</p><p>If the city&apos;s proposal is accepted, the autonomous vehicle program would run along 10th Street, which connects the National Mall via Independence Avenue and Banneker Park to The Wharf, according to the mayor&apos;s office. The street sits above Interstate 395 and about 4,300 cars travel it each day, which would be enough to test autonomous vehicles in real-life traffic situations.</p><p>The first step in this process is a Request for Information (RFI), which asks for information and input from autonomous vehicle providers and other technology companies. <a href="https://www.swbid.org/avrfi" target="new">The RFI also offers a look</a> at where proposed testing route is located. <p>Washington&apos;s elected officials began exploring autonomous vehicle technology in 2017, and Bowser recently traveled to Silicon Valley to pitch the city as a test area for the technology. If approved, it would make the District one of the few Northeast cities testing autonomous technology.</p><p>Right now, most self-driving and autonomous vehicle testing is conducted in the Western US, in Nevada, Arizona and <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">California</a>, which is near where these technologies are being developed in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>The surprise settlement of Waymo&apos;s trade-secrets lawsuit against Uber last week may have saved both companies from the harsh glare of the spotlight, but it probably won&apos;t determine who supplies your first driverless ride.</p><p>Waymo <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">accused</a> Uber of using its trade secrets to develop Lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars and sought as much as $1.8 billion in damages. But last Friday, the companies announced a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">settlement</a> in which Waymo will get a small stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, and a commitment from the ride-hailing giant not to use Waymo&apos;s confidential hardware or software. </p><p>The settlement, which the companies reached late on February 8 after only four days in court, ended a trial that was expected to last three weeks. A federal jury and a media throng had already heard unsettling tales of take-no-prisoners culture that Uber is trying to put behind it. Waymo ran the risk, like any litigant, of losing its case. </p><p>The deal may allow the companies to take another shot at a partnership they had discussed several times since 2013: Waymo -- then known as Google&apos;s Project Chauffeur -- had driverless cars, and Uber had a popular ride-hailing service. When the planned partnership never actually took shape, Uber started developing its own autonomous technology and the two companies ended up on a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">collision course</a>.</p><p>But this wasn&apos;t a clash between full-fledged rivals in a mature business, like the years-long smartphone litigation between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co." target="new">Apple and Samsung</a>. So far, the self-driving car industry is essentially a set of experiments. That&apos;s why all eyes are on the basic technologies -- for now. </p><p>"Early on, it&apos;s going to be about technology leadership. But later on, it&apos;s going to be about business models and supply chains," said Bob O&apos;Donnell, president of market research and consulting firm Technalysis Research. </p><p>If Uber was using stolen Waymo designs -- which Uber denies -- the settlement may cost the company some time in its quest to make cars drive themselves, which ultimately affects its bottom line and market value, O&apos;Donnell said. "The entire business model of Uber is based on the fact that eventually they aren&apos;t going to have to pay anybody." </p><p>But by 2030, when various forecasts predict autonomous cars will perform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/25-of-u-s-driving-could-be-done-by-self-driving-cars-by-2030-study-finds/" target="new">many</a> of our trips – as much as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/rethinkx-selfdriving-electric-cars-will-dominate-roads-by-2030" target="new">95%</a> of all miles driven – last week&apos;s settlement may be a nothing more than a footnote. </p><p>"It&apos;s important now, but in 12 years, the market dynamics will also have changed a lot," O&apos;Donnell said. The sky&apos;s the limit on what could happen by then. Uber might have acquired Waymo, or vice versa. And everyone in today&apos;s car business, including both automakers and component suppliers like Bosch and Continental, is looking for a piece of the business. </p><p>"There&apos;s not going to be one winner. Even if Waymo has a head start now, that&apos;s not the end of the story," O&apos;Donnell said. </p><p>What&apos;s more, all the winners will need partners to succeed. The whole car industry is a complex web of manufacturers and suppliers. Even Tesla relies on third parties for some of its technology. </p><p>There&apos;s a good chance Waymo will eventually be a technology supplier to Uber, Lyft -- where it&apos;s already invested $1 billion -- and other mobility providers, O&apos;Donnell said. Just because Waymo will soon be able to <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">pick you up</a> in a driverless SUV in a few cities doesn&apos;t mean it wants to break into the ride-hailing business for good. </p><p>What may seem like an epic battle for the streets in a San Francisco courtroom is really a fringe fight to most consumers, O&apos;Donnell said. "There&apos;s the Silicon Valley view of the world, and then there&apos;s the actual world."</p><p>A Technalysis survey of 1,000 US consumers last year found that 57% had never used a ride-hailing service and another 23% had only done it once or twice. So what was imminently at stake here wasn&apos;t personal transportation in the suburbs and midsized cities of America. It was reputation, the most valuable commodity in Silicon Valley -- after coding skills and a killer funding round.</p> <p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Uber repeatedly tried to partner with Google for years before the companies ended up as fierce rivals for the future of autonomous cars, Uber founder Travis Kalanick told a jury in San Francisco on Wednesday.</p><p>As early as 2013, Uber talked to Google about pairing its ride-hailing prowess with the larger company&apos;s self-driving car technology, Kalanick said. But over time, it proved hard to get the attention of his contact, Google co-founder Larry Page.</p><p>Tension grew as the two companies&apos; car projects started to overlap. </p> <p>"It was kind of like a little brother with a big brother," Kalanick said of the companies&apos; relationship. He testified Wednesday morning on the third day of a trade-secrets trial between Uber and Waymo -- the company that grew out of Google&apos;s self-driving car effort. Waymo has accused Uber of stealing eight key pieces of its intellectual property by acquiring a startup founded by former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski. The self-driving car company, a division of Google parent Alphabet, is seeking $1.8 billion in damages. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="new">sometimes hot-headed</a> Kalanick seemed calm and mostly at ease as he answered questions on the stand for nearly two hours on February 7, his second and last day of testimony.</p><p>Late in the summer of 2013, Google invited Uber to work with its autonomous car project, Kalanick said. Google picked him up in one of its early self-driving cars. "I&apos;m like &apos;That&apos;s pretty cool,&apos;" Kalanick recalled. But Google wasn&apos;t willing to give as much time to the partnership as Uber wanted, he said. </p> <p>So starting in early 2015, Uber began to hire dozens of engineers from the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh to launch its own self-driving project. That got Google&apos;s attention. </p><p>"Larry was very upset with us about us acquiring the CMU team and starting the autonomy effort ourselves," Kalanick said. "He was a little angry and said, &apos;Why are you doing my thing?&apos;" Put another way, "Generally, Google was super unhappy, unpumped, about us doing this," he said. </p><p>Those hirings gave Uber an advantage over Google that only grew after Uber attracted Levandowski and other Google employees, Uber&apos;s lawyers have argued. They say Waymo is suing because it can&apos;t keep up. </p> <p>Kalanick had a phone call with Page in October 2016, after Uber acquired of Levandowski&apos;s startup, called Otto. He said Page complained, "You&apos;re taking our people. You&apos;re taking our IP." Kalanick said he told Page that Uber had a process to make sure it wasn&apos;t stealing Google&apos;s intellectual property. </p><p>Under questioning from an attorney for Uber, Karen Dunn of the firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner, Kalanick said Uber hired Levandowski in 2016 for his brains, not trade secrets.</p><p>"We hired Anthony because we felt that he was incredibly visionary, a very good technologist, and he was also very charming," Kalanick said. For one thing, Levandowski had a vision of what autonomous ride-hailing fleets could mean for cities of the future. </p><p>Kalanick also testified that Lidar, the laser-based vision system used in both Google&apos;s and Uber&apos;s vehicles, was only part of what Uber was seeking when it acquired Otto for $592 million. Waymo has said its former employee took its secret Lidar designs to Uber, which then duplicated them. </p> <p>Under questioning by Waymo&apos;s attorney, Charles Verhoeven of Quinn Emmanuel, Kalanick admitted that he went ahead with the Otto acquisition knowing Waymo might sue alleging intellectual-property theft.</p><p>At Levandowski&apos;s request, Uber eventually agreed to indemnify him against such a lawsuit. </p> <p>He also admitted that he never read a due-diligence report that Uber ordered from a forensics firm to ensure it didn&apos;t receive any trade secrets through the acquisition. Kalanick said he signs hundreds of documents every day and doesn&apos;t have time to read everything. </p><pPKalanick&apos;s testimony on Wednesday shed light on Silicon Valley&apos;s rough-and-tumble culture through the eyes of one of its most legendary -- or notorious -- executives. </p> <p>Waymo&apos;s Verhoeven questioned Kalanick over many texts he exchanged with Levandowski in the months leading up to the Otto acquisition. One text from Levandowski simply said, "Burn the village." Another Uber executive&apos;s notes from a meeting showed Kalanick saying, "The golden time is over. It is war time." Asked about this quote, he told Verhoeven, "It sounds like something I would say." </p> <p>Another text that Levandowski sent as Uber considered acquiring his company said, "Here&apos;s the speech you need to give," followed by a "wink" emoji and a YouTube link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="new">"greed is good"</a> monologue from the 1987 film <i>Wall Street</i>.</p> <p>Tech slang is also playing a role in the case. Notes from one Uber meeting showed Kalanick saying the company should get "cheat codes" for self-driving technology. </p> <p>Verhoeven characterized "cheat codes" as codes designed to allow gamers to advance to the next level without earning points through the game to get there. But at one point in court, Kalanick defined the term another way, as anything that lets someone avoid a task or investment. He said one example of a "cheat code" might be Uber collecting real-time motion data from its cars as they stop and start at traffic lights. In aggregate, that data could allow Uber to tell what lights were red or green all across a city without having to install cameras to watch the lights. The data could be used for route planning and other applications. </p><p>The trial before Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco continues Thursday and is expected to last about three weeks. </p> <p>(<i>Image: Wikimedia Commons</i>)</p><p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Even among eccentric tech executives, Tesla CEO and Chief Designer Elon Musk stands out. On Tuesday, while Waymo and Uber spent another day squabbling over alleged theft of trade secrets, Musk took the high road -- 400 million miles high, eventually.</p><p>A test launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket designed and built by SpaceX, Musk&apos;s aerospace startup, carried the Tesla founder&apos;s personal Tesla Roadster out beyond the bonds of Earth to eventually orbit around the sun. </p><p>The sports car in Midnight Cherry, an example of the electric car maker&apos;s first model, made from 2008 to 2012, isn&apos;t quite driverless: It&apos;s carrying a space-suited dummy named Starman, in a pleasure-driving pose with one arm resting on top of the convertible&apos;s door. (The space suit is SpaceX&apos;s own design.) But if the journey goes as planned, the car will find its way around the sun and past Earth and Mars, as long as the hardware and the laws of physics last.</p><p>Its estimated range of 200 miles on a charge only applies on Earth. </p> <p>On board the car is also a toy Roadster with its own tiny astronaut, as well as an optical storage device containing Isaac Asimov&apos;s <i>Foundation</i> trilogy of sci-fi novels and a plaque with the names of more than 6,000 SpaceX employees, SpaceX said during a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="new">livestream</a> of the launch. </p> <p>SpaceX is streaming <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXxyXggQenJM" target="new">live views</a> of the Roadster online.</p><p>The Roadster isn&apos;t the first electric car to leave Earth, as <a href="https://www.space.com/39606-spacex-falcon-heavy-fourth-car-space.html" target="new">Space.com</a> points out. The three lunar rovers used on NASA&apos;s Apollo missions got there first. </p><p>The main purpose of the February 6 test launch is to find out how the Falcon Heavy performs. Every rocket needs a payload for realistic testing, and usually it&apos;s just a block of cement or some other weighty object that can be placed where the crew or cargo would go. Musk, who no doubt is getting ready to replace his Roadster with one from the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/roadster" target="new">new batch</a> due in 2020 anyway, is just using a payload with a bit more flair. </p> <p>The car&apos;s svelte 2,700-pound curb weight doesn&apos;t even begin to simulate all that the Falcon Heavy can carry. It&apos;s powerful enough to lift nearly 64 metric tons, or the weight of a fully loaded Boeing 737, into orbit, according to SpaceX. Only the Saturn V, used for the Apollo moon missions in the 1960s and 1970s, has had a greater carrying capacity. </p><p>SpaceX calls the Falcon Heavy the most powerful operational rocket in the world, with more than 5 million pounds of thrust at lift-off, equal to the power of 18 Boeing 747s. Its three rocket cores contain 27 engines. </p><p>The Falcon Heavy took off from Launch Complex 39A NASA&apos;s Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral, Fla., the same launchpad the Saturn V used. But unlike the classic NASA rocket, the Falcon Heavy sent at least two of its giant lower stages back to Earth. Those two stages had come back from earlier SpaceX launches and returned together to their designated landing pads to be reused again. </p> <p>Another stage of the rocket was designed to land on an autonomous barge off the Florida coast. It wasn&apos;t clear late Monday whether that maneuver had worked. </p> <p>SpaceX built the Falcon Heavy so it could launch bigger satellites and future manned spacecraft. It has already launched multiple supply missions to the International Space Station. Musk&apos;s goal is to eventually mount a mission to Mars. </p> <p>The roadster&apos;s trip, which will take it as far as 400 million  kilometers away from Earth at speeds up to 40,000km per hour, may last a billion years, SpaceX says. By then, everyone who pre-ordered a Tesla Model 3 may actually have their cars. </p><p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

He compared the former Uber CEO to a <a href="http://archive.boston.com/sports/blogs/shesgamesports/2013/03/where-are-they-now-rosie-ruiz-and-the-man-who-uncovered-her-ruse.html" target="new">marathon runner</a> who secretly takes the subway.</p> <p>Uber, for its part, charged that Waymo was the company falling behind and that it sued Uber to stall its biggest rival. Levandowski brought nothing to Uber that wasn&apos;t commonly known among Lidar engineers, attorney Bill Carmody of Susman Godfrey said in Uber&apos;s opening argument. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">jury trial</a> before Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco has put self-driving technology in the spotlight and Silicon Valley culture under the microscope. The opening arguments drew one of the biggest media throngs of any tech trial in recent memory, partly because Uber and Alphabet, the parent company of Google and Waymo, are among the most closely watched in the tech world. </p> <p>Even before the jury was seated on February 5, Alsup made it clear tech-star privilege would have no place in his court. One witness who had requested a private room at the courthouse wasn&apos;t going to get it, he said. "You&apos;re going to have to be just like the rest of us," Alsup said. </p> <p>The eight alleged secrets at issue in the case involve Lidar, the system most self-driving cars use to sense their surroundings by constantly bouncing laser beams off of objects. </p><p>"We paint the world with these beams of light and figure out where things are very precisely," Waymo CEO John Krafcik said on the witness stand Monday. </p> <p>Levandowski led Google&apos;s development of Lidar until he resigned in late January 2016 for autonomous trucking startup Otto, which was founded a few days later. Otto publicly launched in May 2016 and was acquired by Uber in August, but Waymo charged that Levandowski was frequently in contact with Uber before Otto had even taken shape. </p> <p>The plan all along was for Uber to "acqui-hire" Levandowski and other top Google engineers for their expertise and trade secrets they knew, Waymo&apos;s Verhoeven said, citing Uber meeting notes and other documents. The code name for this project? A dollar sign. </p><p>As part of the deal, Uber agreed to indemnify Levandowski and other top hires against allegations of intellectual property theft, Verhoeven said. </p> <p>Krafcik, the first witness to take the stand, recalled taking over Google&apos;s car project in September 2015 and trying to get to know Levandowski better. "He was an interesting character," said Krafcik, a longtime automotive engineer and executive. </p><p>The two had different ideas about safety, with Levandowski opposed to Krafcik&apos;s insistence on including backup steering and braking systems in its self-driving vehicles, he said. But Levandowski&apos;s resignation the following January came as a surprise, Krafcik said. </p> <p>"He had gone from someone I had considered a friend to someone I considered an enemy," he said. </p> <p>Uber argued it took extraordinary measures to ensure it hadn&apos;t acquired any trade secrets after it acquired Otto. A forensics firm interviewed the new employees and examined the data on their personal devices, Carmody said. Waymo itself came to Uber 11 times to check its servers for proprietary information, he said. </p><p>What Waymo calls secrets are common Lidar knowledge that Google had considered posting publicly, Uber said. The company came by its core technology legitimately by hiring a team of engineers from Carnegie-Mellon University and other elsewhere. </p> <p>"The tech here tells the truth," Carmody said. "What&apos;s in here comes from people at Uber who bring to bear their engineering talents." </p> <p>The trial is expected to continue for about three weeks. Kalanick and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are among the possible witnesses.</p><p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>The celebrated court battle between autonomous driving hopefuls Waymo and Uber will finally begin on Monday, February 5. After nearly a year of accusations and revelations, a federal jury will hear the opening arguments in a case that could reshape the self-driving car industry.</p><p>The trial, under US District Court Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, is expected to last three weeks and might see Uber founder Travis Kalanick, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and other well known Silicon Valley names take the stand. </p> <p>Waymo&apos;s stark <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7dzPLynxaXuQjY3dkllZ2ZKb0k/view" target="new">allegations</a>, an apparent criminal probe, and the shake-up that has since rocked Uber, have brought rapt attention to the case. But what&apos;s fueling the fight is the global competition to corner what may become a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/passenger-economy-report-infographic.html" target="new">$7 trillion industry</a> by 2050. The suit could knock Uber back in a race that has drawn in the world&apos;s biggest automakers and tech companies as well as countless startups. </p> <p>At the heart of the case is the idea that Waymo developed important technologies first and Uber -- which didn&apos;t launch its self-driving project until 2015 -- stole its work to catch up. </p> <p>Waymo, formerly Google&apos;s self-driving car project and now a division of Alphabet, is testing autonomous Chrysler Pacific minivans in at least three cities and plans to commercially launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Phoenix this year. In the past week, the company announced it would order thousands more of the vans. <a href="https://www.navigantresearch.com/research/navigant-research-leaderboard-automated-driving-vehicles" target="new">Navigant Research</a> recently ranked Waymo among the top companies in the business, just behind General Motors.</p><p>Uber began offering test rides in self-driving cars in Pittsburgh last year and has said it will <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">soon be able to operate cars without safety drivers</a>. But the Navigant report ranked it as an industry challenger, two rungs below Waymo. </p><p>Google jumped on autonomous driving earlier than many, launching its self-driving car project in 2009. Former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski worked there, then left to form the autonomous truck startup Otto in 2016. Waymo alleges that before he left, Levandowski used special software on his laptop to get into Waymo&apos;s design server and download more than 14,000 confidential files about the company&apos;s Lidar designs. </p> <p>Other Waymo engineers who later worked for Levandowski at Otto also stole secrets, the suit charges. Waymo alleges that when Uber acquired Otto later that year, partly for its Lidar system, what it really got was technology stolen from Waymo. Lidar, which uses lasers to sense cars, people, and objects around a vehicle, is a critical component in most autonomous vehicles and the focus of a race to <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">boost resolution</a> and cut size and cost. </p> <p>Waymo says it discovered Uber was using its Lidar designs when it was accidentally copied in on an e-mail from one of Uber&apos;s Lidar component providers. </p><p>"Otto and Uber have taken Waymo&apos;s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology," the complaint said. </p><p>Uber promptly <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-shoots-down-googles-claims-of-stolen-self-driving-tech-2017-2" target="new">denied</a> the charges and called the suit "a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." </p><p>After filing the suit on February 23, 2017, Waymo asked Judge Alsup to halt Uber&apos;s self-driving initiative until the case could be decided. In May, the judge declined to shut down the project but ordered Levandowski not to work on any Lidar-related projects. </p><p>Late last year, a letter to Alsup <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/doj-confirms-new-criminal-probe-linked-to-waymo-v-uber-lawsuit/" target="new">revealed</a> that federal prosecutors were conducting a criminal investigation related to Uber&apos;s acquisition of Otto. It said they were looking into the possibility that Kalanick and Levandowski used "non-attributable electronic devices" to communicate outside of Uber&apos;s official systems. </p><p>Preparations for the trial have played out against the backdrop of a shake-up at Uber that forced Kalanick out as CEO and altered the company&apos;s board. Among the triggers were controversy over allegations of sexual harassment and underhanded surveillance practices at the company. </p><p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

A grocer who participated in the demonstration said Udelv&apos;s vans and ordering software could cut delivery costs in half and give customers a better idea of when their orders will arrive. </p><p>Also on Tuesday, Silicon Valley startup <a href="https://nuro.ai/" target="new">Nuro</a> unveiled an even smaller autonomous delivery vehicle with no driver’s seat or steering wheel. It’s designed for neighborhood streets and is about half the width of a typical passenger car. The company also announced it has raised $92 million in two Series A rounds of funding. </p> <p>Udelv and Nuro are the latest entrants into the last-mile delivery business, which has grown with the rise of online shopping. E-commerce giants and startups alike are looking at new technologies like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b" target="new">drones and sidewalk-roaming</a> <a href="https://www.starship.xyz/" target="new">robots</a> to cut costs and delivery times, but the task may also be well suited to autonomous vehicles on the street.</p> <p>In Udelv&apos;s demonstration on Tuesday, its autonomous van made what the company called the world&apos;s first such delivery run on public roads. It covered a 2.5-mile route from Draeger&apos;s, a local market, to two nearby customers. As required by California law, a safety driver was at the wheel to take over if necessary, but the drive went flawlessly, Udelv said. </p> <p>The startup, based in the neighboring town of Burlingame, designs and builds the vans itself using an electric drivetrain, chassis, sensors and other components from third parties. It won&apos;t sell the vehicles but offer delivery as a service to companies. The vehicle has a conventional cab and can be driven manually, or even remotely over a cellular connection, Udelv CEO Daniel Laury said. Its cargo space is divided into separate compartments, each with its own door that customers can unlock with their phones using Udelv&apos;s app.</p> <p>The van&apos;s limited mission made it easier to develop than self-driving cars designed for passengers, Laury said. The vehicle is designed exclusively for local deliveries, with a top speed of 25 MPH. It didn&apos;t have to be designed for a comfortable ride or to deal with all possible driving and weather conditions that a long-range vehicle might run into. The van can go 60 miles between charges. It took about two years to develop, Laury said.</p> <p>Unlike the major auto manufacturers, Udelv can start small, he said.</p> <p> "There is a tremendous amount of business that we can do in states... that have great weather conditions, that have very nice roads, that have good driving policies," Laury told The Connected Car. "I don&apos;t see a Ford or a General Motors, or one of those large OEMs manufacturing a car for just California, for example."</p><p>Udelv plans to put dozens of vans on the road this year in the San Francisco Bay Area. Under current state law, it can operate them autonomously in test mode with a safety driver as long as they&apos;re not making deliveries. The vans can also be used for deliveries as long as they&apos;re manually driven, Laury said. </p><p>The San Mateo demonstration was done in conjunction with Draeger&apos;s, a small chain of upscale markets in the Bay Area, and Delivery Guys, which does deliveries for Draeger&apos;s. </p> <p>Udelv should help Draeger&apos;s compete with big online retailers and with stores that use services like Instacart, said Richard Draeger, the owner of the chain. </p><p>Both Udelv&apos;s ordering platform and its driverless vans should make deliveries cheaper and more efficient, Draeger said. He predicts the cost of a delivery will be cut at least in half, and even more once the service is running at full volume. </p> <p>"That is the biggest hurdle for delivery going mainstream," Draeger said. </p><p>Also, the current four-hour delivery window that customers get can be cut to one or two hours because Udelv&apos;s app and back-end software will streamline the process, he said. </p> <p>One thing a self-driving van can&apos;t do is bring groceries to the customer&apos;s door. That&apos;s a tradeoff, but with a shorter time window, they&apos;ll be more willing to stay home and wait for the van to arrive, Draeger said. </p> <p>— <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>For a long time, the phrase "driverless cars" has been something of a misnomer.</p><p>With the technology still being developed, safety concerns have necessitated at least one, and sometimes two, human monitors inside of autonomous vehicles. These monitors check the status of a vehicle and are ready to take over control should it become necessary. Of course, "self-driving cars with fully alert engineer attendants" doesn&apos;t quite have the same ring to it.</p><p>But the day of truly "driverless" cars is approaching. <a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/" target="new">Uber</a>, which has been a leader in the development of autonomous ride-hailing fleets, recently claimed that it was getting close to launching autonomous vehicles that could operate without a human backup. Eric Meyhofer, head of Uber&apos;s Advanced Technology Group that oversees self-driving cars, told the Associated Press that the company would put the monitor-free cars on roads once it felt it was completely safe to do so.</p><p>"Once we can check that box, which we call passing the robot driver&apos;s license test, that&apos;s when we can remove the vehicle operator," Meyhofer <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2018-01-17/uber-close-to-scrapping-human-backups-in-self-driving-cars" target="new">said</a>. "We&apos;re going aggressively too."</p><p>Uber does seem to have made significant strides recently. It was only in October that Uber said it would <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">remove a passenger&apos;s seat operator</a> from its self-driving vehicles, leaving only one human operator in the driver&apos;s seat. The move was part of the relaunch of Uber&apos;s autonomous ride-hailing service in Pittsburgh, which originally began in 2016.</p><p>As of now, only one company has officially announced that it will put operator-free AVs on the road: <a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new">Waymo</a>. In November, the company divulged that it had <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">already launched</a> truly driverless cars around Phoenix, where it does much of its testing. It also released plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in that very area in 2018.</p><p>Uber, of course, is currently embroiled in a lawsuit filed by Waymo, alleging that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski stole thousands of proprietary files from the Google spin-off and brought them to Uber, where he went to work soon after. Late last year, a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">letter</a> emerged in the case that described unethical work practices at Uber, including the use of "stolen Waymo trade secrets." While the case figures to drag on for far longer than anyone would like it to, it has already contributed to a significant decline in Uber&apos;s reputation.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear whether deploying a fully driverless fleet will improve that reputation. But big technology breakthroughs in the autonomous vehicle space are tough to ignore. If Uber can show that is at least keeping pace with Waymo in the race to create truly autonomous vehicles, it will go a long way to helping the company reclaim its status.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Uber Is Close to Deploying AVs Without Human Backups' --post_excerpt='Uber says it is close to &apos;passing the robot driver&apos;s license test.&apos;' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Uber Is Close to Deploying AVs Without Human Backups' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2018-01-31 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2018-01-31 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,9,4,5" --tags_input='Uber, autonomous vehicles, driverless cars, self-driving, ride-hailing, fleet' --tax_input=''

Since almost all of the technology involved is still developing, small companies have ample opportunity to get involved, innovate and compete with larger companies on AV components such as Lidar sensors, artificial intelligence systems and HD mapping.</p><p>But building a self-driving car from the ground up? That&apos;s an area that&apos;s still for the most part reserved for the big boys.</p><p>It&apos;s no coincidence that the companies taking on this challenge are traditional automakers. Even a self-driving heavyweight like Waymo still relies on a fleet of minivans produced by Chrysler. There are so many hardware and software costs associated with building a complete driverless car that it&apos;s hard to see how an independent startup could realistically compete.</p><p>That is not deterring the team at self-driving startup <a href="https://www.pony.ai/" target="new">Pony.ai</a>. Pony.ai was only founded in late 2016, but it has set its sights on building a complete driverless car. If it falls short of its goals it probably won&apos;t be for lack of money. It was recently announced that Pony.ai received a whopping $112 million in financing for its Series A round.</p><p>The fundraising was led by Morningside Venture Capital and Legend Capital, each of which has a primary focus on Chinese investments. (Pony.ai is "co-located" in Silicon Valley and Beijing.) Also participating in the round were Sequoia China, IDG Capital, Hongtai Capital, Legend Star, Puhua Capital, Polaris Capital, DCM Ventures, Comcast Ventures and Silicon Valley Future Capital. As the size of the investment suggests, these partners believe that Pony.ai has a chance to make an enormous splash in the autonomous vehicle space.</p><p>"Pony.ai is one of the very few companies we&apos;ve seen that possesses the critical success factors: a team with a proven track record and extremely well-rounded technical expertise from both research and industry backgrounds," Legend Capital managing director Wenji Jin noted in a <a href="https://nbherard.com/business/autonomous-driving-startup-pony-ai-raises-112m/55555" target="_blank">statement</a>. "From product definition and systems integration to artificial intelligence, Pony.ai is the leader in this nascent industry. I believe Pony.ai holds the most promise in delivering [Level 4 vehicular autonomy] technology to the mass market."</p><p>The company&apos;s co-founders do indeed have an impressive pedigree. Co-founder and CTO Tiancheng Lou worked on Google&apos;s self-driving car project before it was spun off into what is now Waymo. Co-founder and CEO James Peng was a founding member of Baidu&apos;s autonomous driving team.</p><p>Pony.ai will use the Series A funding to launch an autonomous fleet in Guangzhou, China, where the company has an office.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>There are two primary schools of thought when it comes to safety and self-driving cars.</p><p>One perspective holds up the belief that driverless cars will significantly reduce automotive fatalities -- by as much as 90%, according to one commonly cited statistic. To reach that point faster, we should accelerate the rate of introduction of AVs onto our roads now so that it will take less time for them to be perfected.</p><p>The opposing viewpoint is that it is unethical to rush self-driving cars onto public roads before they&apos;re fully developed. The obvious reason is that it could put people&apos;s lives in danger. But a secondary explanation is that if imperfect driverless cars are introduced too early, it could damage the reputation of driverless cars down the road, thus limiting their future potential.</p><p>Of course, no one thinks that an underdeveloped driverless car should be recklessly testing in actual public traffic, but the debate about release timelines continues to dominate the world of autonomous vehicles.</p><p>In a speech at the Detroit Auto Show on earlier this month, US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao straddled the line between enthusiasm for the development of autonomous vehicles and caution in their development. She also announced a new set of AV guidelines, which she referred to as AV 3.0, that will be released in the summer.</p><p>The guidelines, Chao said, won&apos;t focus exclusively on driverless cars -- they&apos;ll address all forms of vehicular autonomy.</p><p>"AV 3.0 will include guidance for more than just automobiles," Chao <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/detroit-auto-show" target="new">said</a>. "It will address barriers to the safe integration of autonomous technology for motor carriers, transit, trucks, infrastructure and other modes, as well. The Department will update this guidance as often as needed. That&apos;s part of our commitment to streamline the process and to keep pace with innovation."</p><p>It was only in September, when the DOT released its last iteration of these guidelines, called "<a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">A Vision for Safety 2.0</a>." Those followed the inaugural guidelines that were released a year earlier. In her remarks, Chao said that this frequent updating was a reflection of the fast-moving development of technology in the AV space.</p><p>Chao also addressed the frequently discussed issue surrounding the impact self-driving cars could have on professional drivers and their job security. Some analysts believe that tens of thousands of people could lose their jobs. In Detroit, Chao lauded the Auto Show for partnering with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to host the first-ever Future Automotive Career Exposition at the event.</p><p>Ultimately, Chao aligned the DOT with the belief that eliminating barriers to AV deployment is the greatest means of promoting automotive safety at large.</p><p>"At the US Department of Transportation, safety will always be our number one priority," she said. "That&apos;s why a key part of DOT&apos;s mission is to cultivate and encourage innovation in safety by eliminating unnecessary obstacles to the development and integration of new technology."</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Transportation Secretary Says New AV Guidelines Are Coming' --post_excerpt='At the Detroit Auto Show, US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao previewed forthcoming AV guidelines.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Transportation Secretary Says New AV Guidelines Are Coming' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2018-01-26 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2018-01-26 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,9,5" --tags_input='Elaine Chao, Department of Transportation, NAIAS, Detroit Auto Show, autonomous vehicles, driverless cars, self-driving' --tax_input=''

Google Voice search had powered much of the functionality in earlier versions of Android Auto, but now the app will receive the complete functionality possible with Google Assistant. </p><p>While asking for directions and dictating messages were possible without Google Assistant, the addition does present some new possibilities. It will be easier to establish personal preferences. You won&apos;t need to ask Google Assistant to play a song "on Spotify," as it will already know that is your preferred app for music. The ability to control Internet of Things (IoT) devices is also new. For example, users will be able to adjust the lights in their home from their car. Some users are excited about the change.</p><p>"Actually, the lack of full [Google Assistant] in Android Auto has been driving me insane," writes commenter Quinton in the top-voted comment on the Android Police post. "I keep asking how late a store is open, for example, and voice search just gets massively confused. This will be better."</p><p>There&apos;s plenty of competition in the in-vehicle voice assistance space, as hands-free functionality is more important in an automobile than perhaps any other setting.

All three levels of configuration -- low, medium and high -- offer cloud services to lower costs for the infotainment system, and even vehicle weight.</p><p>The premium configuration of the Digital Cockpit stands apart from similar products on the market today. Services such as virtual personal assistants and augmented reality can be integrated across as many as four displays. Plus, vehicle preference profiles can be taken from one vehicle to the next. That means that even though the ride-hailing and ride-sharing services may expand, a passenger utilizing the Digital Cockpit platform can still make every vehicle he enters feel like his own.</p><p>The connected car, as game-changing as it has already been, is far from a complete product.</p><p>Many believed that the technology won&apos;t be fully maximized until 5G mobile connectivity is widespread. 5G networks promise incredibly fast connection speeds. Some experts believe they may even replace WiFi. But because industry standards for 5G are yet to be determined, companies have found it hard to prepare for this future.</p><p>With its 5G automotive telematics solution, Samsung and Harman, however, have developed a product that can work with the LTE CAT 16 connectivity of today and be instantly ready for the 5G networks of tomorrow. With up to 1GB per second bandwidth, this telematics solution has the potential speed to enable the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) capabilities that will empower self-driving cars.</p><p>In designing its autonomous platform DRVLINE, Samsung and Harman wanted to create a future-proofed product.</p><p>Everyone wants to build an autonomous driving platform because the potential business from creating the one that becomes ubiquitous across all driverless cars is enormous. The problem is that no one is sure exactly what the technology of tomorrow will look like. With DRVLINE, Samsung and Harman claim to have developed software that is so versatile and customizable that it will be able to serve the AV sector as technology progresses towards Level 5 autonomy.</p><p>"The industry has made incredible advances in automation, yet in-car compute is still a long way from approximating the power of our brains," Harman/Samsung executive John Absmeier wrote in a <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-reveals-drvline-platform-autonomous-future/" target="new">statement</a>.

The vehicles are designed to be appealing to all types of fleet managers, whether it be those shuttling humans -- Uber and Didi -- or those shuttling goods, such as Amazon and Pizza Hut. Digital renderings of the vehicle from Toyota show other uses, as well: Mobile stores, restaurants and work spaces.</p><p>As has become customary for autonomous concept vehicles, the e-Palette features a unique, quirky design. But the boxy-with-rounded-edges design is not whimsical for whimsy&apos;s sake. A barrier-free interior with a low floor allows for maximum space in the cabin, enabling a wide variety of possible uses. The concept includes three different lengths of e-Palette, which Toyota says could allow for a space large enough to serve as a hotel room.</p><p>The concept was the recipient of the inaugural <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/" target="new">Edmunds</a> CES Tech Driven Hackmotive Award.</p><p>"Buzzwords like future mobility and autonomy reverberate throughout the show floor at CES, but Toyota&apos;s innovative e-Palette concept stands out from the crowd thanks to its near-term implementation, established partnerships and visionary execution," Edmunds editor-in-chief Alistair Weaver wrote in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyota-e-palette-concept-wins-inaugural-edmunds-ces-tech-driven-hackomotive-award-at-ces-2018-300581014.html" target="new">statement</a>.

The demise of private car ownership, however, will rightfully be mourned.</p><p>For all of the positives that come with ride sharing, there are still a lot of great things about owning a car. One of the biggest benefits is customization. When you have your own ride, you can tune every element to your exact preference.

At Harman, we are constantly focused on innovating with the passenger in mind, integrating emerging technology with software-driven audio to provide the effortless, responsive experiences consumers have come to expect," Harman&apos;s president of lifestyle audio Michael Mauser wrote in a <a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/new-harman-ux-solutions-deliver-unprecedented-in-car-comfort-and-entertainment-experiences-at-ces-2018" target="_blank">statement</a>. "Moodscape and Configurable Entertainment are perfect examples of how we&apos;re reinventing what is possible in the vehicle today, as well as for the autonomous future."</p><p>Configurable Entertainment leverages Harman&apos;s industry-leading position in the automotive speakers space to offer passengers their preferred sound design for the specific media they&apos;re using. Someone riding in a Configurable Entertainment-equipped car could use JBL audio while gaming, or Harman Kardon audio while listening to music thanks to "shape-shifting speakers" that sound more like a Transformer than an audio component.</p><p>"In-vehicle speakers transform in real-time to provide different experiences in line with user preferences," according to the release. "A unique sound bar or tweeter can dynamically morph from one audio brand experience to another, both sonically and visually."</p><p>Moodscape is designed for passengers who are feeling stressed, contemplative, tired or energetic. Citing growing consumer interest in the "wellness" space, Harman developed Moodscape to adjust the emotions of a passenger. A feature known as Music Motivator "identifies GPS routes and analyzes available biometric feedback to build and deliver an audio experience based on passengers&apos; whereabouts, schedule and energy level."</p><p>Perhaps the coolest feature of Moodscape is the so-called QLED MoodRoof, which projects an immersive environment onto the car&apos;s internal ceiling. While you actually may be riding through downtown Boston, MoodRoof can make it feel as if you&apos;re being guided through a snowy forest or a sunny beach town depending on your preferences.</p><p>Part of the joy of driving home after a long day is being in your own personal space. As consumers transition toward making that drive in a ride-hailing vehicle, Harman is trying to preserve that idea of personal space with Configurable Entertainment and Moodscape.

Most people no longer have Hi-Fi systems in their homes and listen to music primarily through either headphones or small Bluetooth speakers.</p><p>Cars, on the other hand, have numerous speakers and can create a true surround sound experience that enhances the listening experience. Connected cars take the experience even further, with network connectivity-enabled location services that allow drivers and passengers to learn about the area they&apos;re driving in.</p><p>There are, however, limitations.</p><p>One is the size of the screen mounted in a vehicle&apos;s dashboard. While home TVs have grown ever larger, infotainment screens in cars, with the exception of Tesla, have remained rather small.</p><p><a href="https://www.byton.com/index.html" target="new">Byton,</a> which is based in China, is looking to change that. The company introduced the Byton Concept at CES earlier this month, and one of the most noticeable features of the luxury car was its 49-inch "shared experience display" that spanned the entire dashboard from the left edge of the driver&apos;s side to the right end of the passenger side.</p><p>The display screen serves as a massive infotainment center, allowing drivers to access navigation, communication or entertainment features -- or, given the screen&apos;s size and multi-function capabilities, all three at once.</p><p>The design goes above and beyond the traditional luxury vehicle, offering features and amenities that may seem more fitting in first-class air travel.</p><p>"Sit back, relax and feel at home," reads the <a href="https://www.byton.com/concept.html" target="new">website</a> for the concept car. "Inviting color concepts, luxury materials and traditional craftsmanship blend with flair to give a bespoke lounge experience. All our seats are designed to be individually adjustable so you can stay cozy at all times."</p><p>Byton is currently manufacturing an intelligent electric car in Nanjing that will first be made available in China in 2019, and then in the US and Europe in 2020.</p><p>Subsequent vehicles expected from Byton include a sedan and a multi-purpose vehicle, which figure to include certain design elements from the Concept. While some of the vehicle&apos;s more opulent features may seem excessive, they&apos;re tailored to a specific market.</p><p>"Driving is not always very pleasureful in China, and most of the time you&apos;re not moving," Byton executive director of UI design Wolfram Luchner told Sean O&apos;Kane of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/1/9/16867332/byton-electric-ev-car-ride-first-look-test-touchscreen-ces-2018" target="new">The Verge</a>.

The Byton Life Cloud Platform can sync contacts, apps and files from your smartphone with the vehicle&apos;s operating system. And keys aren&apos;t even necessary, as facial recognition cameras can provide access to the vehicle.</p><p>Like all concept cars, the Byton Concept has design and operational elements that will likely never make it into a consumer vehicle.

They can always change the radio station or fast forward their podcast, but that forces them to be distracted from their primary task -- driving -- and they are generally more content to simply listen to the ad.</p><p>As technology has advanced and the emergence of the connected car has defined this decade in automotives, the car cockpit has grown substantially more appealing to marketers.

At CES, Huang announced that Nvidia now has a staggering 320 partnerships with other companies in the self-driving car category. While many of the collaborations were previously known, this was the first time Nvidia itself had released a complete tally of them all.</p><p>Nvidia also took the opportunity to announce four more collaborations.

Now as Uber expands its fleet of self-driving cars and fleet trucks, it will continue to utilize Nvidia technology.</p><p>Volkswagen plans to leverage the Nvidia Drive IX platform, an AI software development kit, to transform cockpit experiences for drivers and create improved safety features. Features built through Nvidia Drive IX will be incorporated in the forthcoming I.D. Bus, Volkswagen&apos;s electric, AI-infused re-imagining of the classic VW Microbus.</p><p>"Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the car," <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/volkswagen-and-nvidia-to-infuse-ai-into-future-vehicle-lineup" target="new">noted</a> Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess. "Autonomous driving, zero-emission mobility and digital networking are virtually impossible without advances in AI and deep learning. Combining the imagination of Volkswagen with Nvidia, the leader in AI technology, enables us to take a big step into the future."</p><p>The Nvidia-ZF-Baidu project is a tricontinental one, as the California software company will be working with the German auto supplier and the Chinese tech giant to combine their proprietary AV technologies to build a single China-specific autonomous vehicle platform. The technologies involved are ZF&apos;s ProAI car computer, Baidu&apos;s Apollo open driverless platform, and the newly announced Nvidia Drive Xavier, an autonomous machine processor.</p><p>Nvidia also announced a deal with Mercedes-Benz.

Like an actual sporting contest, there are favorites and underdogs, and plenty of movement in and out of both camps.</p><p>The Google spinoff <a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new">Waymo</a> is unquestionably in the favorites category. This year, Waymo will become the first company to test driverless cars on public roads without a human attendant, and the first company to launch a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">ride-hailing service</a> featuring autonomous vehicles exclusively. If Waymo is 1, then GM&apos;s autonomous division <a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new">Cruise Automation</a> is 1-A, with <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">100 driverless cars</a> many self-driving cars operating in the hectic <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">streets of San Francisco</a>, and more coming soon to <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">New York City</a>.</p><p>There is a tendency to think of companies such as Waymo, GM and other leaders in the space -- Uber and Tesla -- as singular entities. But the reality is that these are multi-faceted organizations with lots of employees. And as the market for driverless cars has heated up, many of those employees have left big companies to launch their own startups.</p><p>While these startups may be smaller in size, they still have huge ambitions.</p><p>That is certainly the case with <a href="https://aurora.tech/" target="new">Aurora</a>.</p><p>The Palo Alto outfit has an impressive trio of co-founders, including former Tesla Autopilot leader Sterling Anderson, former head of Google self-driving Chris Urmson, and former Uber AV engineer Drew Bagnell.</p><p>Up until the start of the year, Aurora had been operating mostly in stealth mode, but the company kicked off 2018 with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2018/01/04/from-stealth-to-stardom-ex-google-tesla-uber-robocar-icons-snag-vw-hyundai-deals/" target="new">a major announcement</a> that it was working with both Hyundai and Volkswagen to power the automakers&apos; impending autonomous vehicle projects.</p><p>With a sparse website (motto: "We do self-driving cars") that displays a long list of <a href="https://aurora.tech/openings.html" target="new">job openings</a> in Palo Alto, San Francisco and Pittsburgh, Aurora isn&apos;t exactly shouting from the rooftops about its driverless system.</p><p>Volkswagen&apos;s announcement of its partnership with the company, though, provides an idea of what the AV veterans Anderson, Urmson and Bagnell have up their sleeves.</p><p>"Specialists from the Volkswagen Group ... have already been working intensively with experts from Aurora to integrate Aurora&apos;s self-driving system including sensors, hardware and software, such as Machine Learning and AI technology in Volkswagen Group&apos;s vehicle platforms," reads the <a href="https://media.vw.com/releases/967" target="new">release</a>. "With the customer experience at the center of this technology development, the Volkswagen Group is focused on creating new solutions, with the goal of providing best-in-class user experience with a focus on safety, convenience and usability."</p><p>Volkswagen plans to leverage Aurora&apos;s technology to build upon its <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Sedric concept</a>. First unveiled in March of 2017, Sedric will represent a "family" of fully autonomous vehicles of various purposes.</p><p>While Aurora&apos;s work with Volkswagen reportedly has been ongoing for about a year, the company&apos;s engagement with Hyundai is a more recent development. Hyundai says its goal in working with Aurora is to have Level 4 autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021.</p><p>At Level 4 autonomy, a driverless system is expected to complete the entirety of most standard drives on its own.</p><p>The question that remains is how close is Aurora to catching its founders&apos; former employers. The Volkswagen and Hyundai news is certainly encouraging. In the future it may not be necessary, or even desirable, for every automaker to have its own autonomous vehicle platform. So collaborating with a third party that provides off-the-shelf solutions like Aurora makes a lot of sense. Volkswagen, for one, seems to see this as just the beginning of an ongoing and fruitful relationship.</p><p>"Long-term probably only a handful of companies will actually be setting the standard and developing a self-driving system which actually can be delivered into many OEM&apos;s vehicles. I personally believe [Aurora] will be one of these," Volkswagen Group Chief Digital Officer Johann Jungwirth told Forbes. "Until now Aurora hasn&apos;t been open yet for outside investment.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Tragically, many serious auto accidents were only milliseconds away from being prevented.</p><p>Piloting a multi-ton automobile is a game of inches, especially at high speeds. The difference between a major collision and a close call can be the amount of time between when a driver thinks about hitting the brakes or turning the wheel, and the time it takes him or her to actually do it.</p><p>Bridging such a minuscule physiological gap is a daunting challenge. But the so-called "Brain-to-Vehicle" (B2V) technology, which <a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/" target="new">Nissan</a> demonstrated for the first time at CES 2018 in Las Vegas, attempts to do just that.</p><p>The product involves brain-wave reading skullcaps, which drivers wear behind the wheel. Paired with intelligent predictive software, Nissan&apos;s B2V tech can anticipate a driver&apos;s next move, whether it be acceleration, braking or turning. The vehicle can then begin that action before the driver even hits a pedal or turns the steering wheel. Nissan claims the tech makes a difference of 0.2 to 0.5 seconds in performing a given action, "while remaining largely imperceptible."</p><p>The B2V moniker is a reference to connected car technologies like vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity. V2V connectivity allows cars to "talk" to one another on the road, telegraphing their intentions to create more predictable -- and therefore safer -- traffic patterns. V2I connectivity refers to communication between cars and a central grid to optimize on-road operations like the patterns of traffic lights. Many believe that V2X (vehicle-to-everything) connectivity will be essential to the functioning of fully self-driving cars, and Nissan claims its B2V tech will factor into that equation.</p><p>"When most people think about autonomous driving, they have a very impersonal vision of the future, where humans relinquish control to the machines. Yet B2V technology does the opposite, by using signals from their own brain to make the drive even more exciting and enjoyable," Nissan Executive Vice President Daniele Schillaci said in a <a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-3459ed449767a2e07b2e465ced0014bc-180103-01-e" target="new">statement</a>. "Through Nissan Intelligent Mobility, we are moving people to a better world by delivering more autonomy, more electrification and more connectivity."</p><p>The Nissan Intelligent Mobility program, of which B2V is a part of, is an initiative through which Nissan strives to embrace and integrate the most futuristic automotive technology into its vehicles. Other technologies that have come out of Nissan Intelligent Mobility include ProPilot Park, an advanced automated parking system, and e-Pedal, which integrates both acceleration and braking into a single pedal.</p><p>There are both limits and theoretical concerns about Nissan&apos;s B2V product.</p><p>One involves finding a home for the hardware powering the advanced technology inside the vehicle. There are also issues involved with convincing drivers to actually don a wired skullcap every time they get behind the wheel. Then there&apos;s the concern about what would happen if the technology faltered and ended up causing an accident instead of preventing one.</p><p>But as unusual as brain wave-reading hats might appear, the concept of a vehicle using biometric data to anticipate a driver&apos;s actions has enormous potential. If a vehicle can augment human capacities to allow them to perform better than they would on their own, that is certainly a technology worth exploring further.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Nissan&apos;s &apos;Brain-to-Vehicle&apos; Tech Wants to Predict Driver Behavior' --post_excerpt='Wired skullcaps will help Nissan vehicles predict a driver&apos;s next move.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Nissan&apos;s &apos;Brain-to-Vehicle&apos; Tech Wants to Predict Driver Behavior' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2018-01-12 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2018-01-12 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,9,5" --tags_input='Nissan, Nissan Intelligent Mobility, Brain to vehicle, B2V, V2V, V2I, autonomous vehicles, self-driving, driverless' --tax_input=''

Without the need for a human driver, autonomous vehicles operating within ride-hailing services will be able to run 24/7. Fleet managers will need to take advantage of this increased uptime to justify the added expense that will come with the first wave of self-driving cars.

It can provide an additional layer of security for payment services at toll booths and gas stations. Its uses even extend into infotainment: Upon identifying a driver via a retinal scan, a connected car system could automatically implement their preferred settings for seat positioning, cabin temperature and music.</p><p>The mechanism that will trigger the retinal scan in equipped cars is slick. Once in the car, all a driver needs to do is look into the rearview mirror. Their presence will be detected, and the system will commence the scan that uses near-infrared emitters and an iris-scanning camera as hardware.</p><p>The retina scanning is only one of the new features that Gentex plans to reveal at CES. HomeLink Connect is an app that allows drivers in to control radio-frequency devices like garage doors from their car. It can even allow them to control IoT devices like connected thermostats, lighting and security systems, all from the comfort of a vehicle.</p><p>"By adding cloud-based wireless control to HomeLink&apos;s traditional [radio frequency] functionality, the feature stands to remain the industry&apos;s most versatile, reliable, and comprehensive in-vehicle home automation system," Downing noted.

Instead, cars should be trained to operate using high-definition cameras, low-cost radars and powerful AI that mimics the human brain."</p><p>The idea that Lidar is "worthless in snow," advanced by Olga Uskova of Russian AV software developer Cognitive Technologies may be an extreme position -- nearly all driverless car manufacturers incorporate Lidar sensors in some form.</p><p>Nevertheless, Lidar does not work as effectively in the snow, and developers have relied more heavily on other hardware to navigate in adverse conditions.

The expected culprits were to blame for the difficulties: Snow-covered road signs were difficult for systems to detect, and non-Russian speakers had an even more challenging time differentiating between similar looking road signs.</p><p>While success proved elusive at the hackathon, in some ways, that was beside the point.</p><p>The fact that driverless car developers are moving beyond building cars that can work in the idealistic sunny climates of Arizona and California and shifting to the more challenging task of creating vehicles that can work in more realistic scenarios is an important sign of progress.</p><p>Many expect that self-driving cars will eventually operate 24/7, but they will only be able to do that if they can handle the weather and unique road conditions that present themselves at every moment of the day all over the world.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Autonomous Car Testing in Moscow Is Hard & Necessary' --post_excerpt='A three-day hackathon showed just how hard it is to design an autonomous system for Moscow roads.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Autonomous Car Testing in Moscow Is Hard & Necessary' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2018-01-10 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2018-01-10 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,6,9,5" --tags_input='autonomous vehicles, self-driving, driverless, Moscow, Russia, hackathon, Uber, Nvidia' --tax_input=''

There are other savings, as well.</p><p>Maintenance costs can be far lower for electric vehicles than their fossil fuel-powered counterparts because EVs are comprised of fewer parts that need less frequent servicing. Plus, the environmental benefits of electric cars and their reduced greenhouse gas emissions becomes increasingly attractive as climate change weighs more heavily on corporate and consumer behavior.</p><p>But a series of roadblocks have delayed the long-awaited spread of electric vehicles over the years. Reshaping the primary energy source for the world&apos;s foremost form of transportation is no small feat, it turns out. And in a recent interview with Bloomberg, one of the inventors of the lithium-ion battery raised another issue that EV designers ought to pay close attention to. </p><p>"Cars are a completely new application, and we&apos;ll have to wait until we find out what kind of batteries will really be needed," <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-26/autonomous-cars-need-tougher-batteries-lithium-ion-pioneer-says" target="new">said</a> Akira Yoshino, who created a prototype of the lithium-ion battery in 1985. "The future of batteries depends on what will happen to the future of the automobile society."</p><p>Yoshino&apos;s concerns have to do with emerging driverless car technology, and the ways in which it may reshape vehicle ownership models.</p><p>Transportation experts expect that autonomous vehicles, which will likely be electric vehicles, will cause a shift away from individual car ownership and towards ride-hailing services offered by fleet owners. Since these driverless cars can theoretically operate 24/7, Yoshino believes that the current EV battery designs will have to change.</p><p>"A car shared by ten people means it will be running ten times more," he said. "Durability will become very important."</p><p>Working for Japanese chemical company <a href="http://www.asahi-kasei.co.jp/asahi/en/" target="new">Asahi Kasei Corp.</a> in the 1980s, Yoshino invented a lithium-ion battery prototype that used polyacetylene as the anode, enabling the small, rechargeable electronic devices that are now so central to modern life.</p><p>Electric battery concerns recently arose when <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new">Tesla</a> unveiled its <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Semi</a>, an all-electric freight truck that claimed impressive performance specs. Bloomberg reporters Tom Randall and John Lippert questioned whether Tesla will be able to live up to those promises.</p><p>"Tesla&apos;s current generation of high-speed Superchargers have a power output of 120 kilowatts and can add about 180 miles to the battery in a Model S sedan in 30 minutes. But that&apos;s for a passenger car, not a loaded truck," Randall and Lippert <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-24/tesla-s-newest-promises-break-the-laws-of-batteries" target="new">wrote</a>. "To meet Tesla&apos;s claim of 400 miles in 30 minutes for a semi carrying 80,000 pounds would require its new Megachargers to achieve output of more than 1200 kW -- or more than ten times better than Tesla&apos;s fastest chargers available today."</p><p>This would seem to support Yoshino&apos;s claim that a new battery is needed.</p><p>What isn&apos;t yet known is whether Tesla, or some other company, has already made significant strides toward creating one. While Musk is certainly given to grand talk, it&apos;s unlikely he would want to make promises he can&apos;t deliver on.

In late December, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/21/apple-patents-navigation-system-for-self-driving-cars.html" target="new">CNBC reported</a> that the US Patent and Trademark Office had published an Apple patent application entitled "Autonomous Navigation System." The patent, which had been in the works since at least 2015, describes an autonomous system that would learn to navigate a given road autonomously by first being guided through it by a human driver.</p><p>"The vehicle includes sensor devices which monitor characteristics of the driving route based on the vehicle being navigated along the driving route," reads the <a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw" target="new">application</a>. "And an autonomous navigation system which is interoperable with the sensor devices to: implement a succession of updates to a virtual characterization of the driving route, based on monitoring a succession of manual navigations of the vehicle along the driving route, associate a confidence indicator with the virtual characterization... and enable autonomous navigation of the vehicle along the driving route."</p><p>While a "virtual characterization of [a] driving route," may sound an awful lot like the digital maps that many consider to be a fundamental component of a successful autonomous vehicle, the patent positions its technology as something of a correction to digital mapping in its current form.</p><p>"The development of such a map can require extensive expenditures of time and effort," the patent reads. "In addition... such a map can unexpectedly become obsolete and unusable for safe autonomous navigation of a route."</p><p>These are certainly valid criticisms of the limits of digital mapping for autonomous vehicles. But those holes in the capabilities of mapping are exactly why very few AV developers have chosen to build their vehicles to rely solely on mapping; most are equipped with mapping capabilities and a suite of physical sensors, each of which covers up the deficiencies of the other. And given that its "virtual characterizations" would be built off of previous trips through given stretches of road, it&apos;s unclear how such a system would be any less vulnerable to sudden obsolescence than a conventional digital map.</p><p>Regardless, the patent application signals that Apple is still very much in the autonomous vehicle game.</p><p>Even though Apple <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">scaled back</a> plans for Project Titan, an effort to develop a self-driving car from the ground up, news continues to emerge out of Cupertino about new AV developments.
