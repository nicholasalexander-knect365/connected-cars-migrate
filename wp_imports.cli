wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Industries tend to coalesce around certain regions. Sometimes, it&apos;s due to geography, as with the lumber industry in the Pacific Northwest. Sometimes, it&apos;s more circumstantial. But when a city or region becomes known as "The Home of X," the implications can be far-reaching. </p> <p>In today&apos;s accelerated development cycles, industries can pop up quickly, forcing a city to play catch-up to accommodate the new businesses.</p><p>Autonomous vehicles, however, are a bit different.</p><p>While the technology has advanced greatly in recent years, it is still deep in the development and testing stages and still not "ready for prime time." That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s vaporware though. The autonomous vehicle revolution is coming -- there is little debate.</p><p>However, this means cities find themselves at a rare moment where they can establish themselves early in an industry that could help set the region&apos;s course for decades to come. And the race to become the home of the autonomous car industry is very much on.</p> <p>The market for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles could grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and finally to $290 billion in 2035, according to a <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/technology-driving-innovation/cars-2025/" target="_blank">2016 Goldman Sachs study</a>.</p><p>Areas around the United States want to be the place where that business is taking place. There are certain areas one&apos;s mind naturally gravitates toward. There&apos;s Detroit, the home of the automobile industry, or Silicon Valley, the birthplace of the technology driving the connected car industry. Still, these areas are far from the only players.</p><p>As part of a series on autonomous cars, the Detroit Free Press and USA Today Network <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/06/26/cities-lure-self-driving-car-jobs-gold-rush/101178670/" target="_blank">looked at nine different regions</a> to explore the current state of the industry in the area and its chances of luring more business in the future.</p> {image 1}<p>The nine cities featured include the likely candidates mentioned above that have related industries. However, there are other areas that are home to universities where cutting-edge research is being conducted, which, in turn, is spawning talented engineers who are developing new startups. These include Austin, Boston, Columbus, Nashville, Reno, Phoenix and Pittsburgh. </p> <p>Austin&apos;s mayor has called his city "The Kitty Hawk of driverless cars" for its pioneering role, which includes being the site of Waymo&apos;s first fully autonomous test drive. And while the University of Texas and Texas A&M may be rivals on the football field, the two institutions have joined together to become part of a consortium that is creating a network of proving grounds and testing facilities.</p> <p>Columbus recently beat out seven other finalists for $50 million in federal and private funding to spur its driverless car industry. The city has received buy-in for its efforts from companies already based in Columbus. Victoria&apos;s Secret parent company, L Brands, is particularly interested in utilizing autonomous fleet technology to make its shipping and warehousing more efficient.</p> <p>Reno has also emerged as a big player. Its proximity to California, dry climate and wide open spaces make it an ideal location. Nevada was the first state to adopt legislation allowing the testing of self-driving cars and it hasn&apos;t really taken its foot off the gas since. Google recently purchased 1,210 acres at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, and while it has not said what it will do with the space, it&apos;s not hard to imagine becoming a facility for Waymo. And Tesla&apos;s massive Gigafactory is outside of Reno churning out the batteries that will power its cars, all of which it plans to eventually equip with self-driving technology.</p> <p>Then there&apos;s the big boys.</p><p>The major automakers in Detroit are all pulling for the city to become what Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford calls "ground zero" for the future of mobility. It remains to be seen how strong that commitment is, especially should autonomous vehicles start to infringe on the automakers&apos; bread-and-butter revenue streams. But the large-scale infrastructure required for testing autonomous vehicles is definitely in place.</p>  <p>Silicon Valley, meanwhile, views autonomous vehicles more as computers than cars and the Northern California region is still the unquestioned hub of the US tech sector, both at the behemoth level and the startup level. Not to mention, it&apos;s home to a number of top engineering universities such as Stanford.</p>  <p>It&apos;s too early to tell which city will win the race. And we&apos;re early enough in the contest that another city could still emerge. But it&apos;s easy to understand why state and local governments are rolling out the red carpet. The chances to completely transform a city&apos;s identity don&apos;t come along all that often, and when they do, you don&apos;t want to be left sticking a thumb in the air trying to hitch a ride. </p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Where Will the Autonomous Vehicle Revolution Call Home?' --post_excerpt='US cities are racing to become the hub of the connected car revolution.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Where Will the Autonomous Vehicle Revolution Call Home?' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-07-06 07:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-07-06 07:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9" --tags_input='connected car, autonomous vehicle, silicon valley, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Austin, Reno' --tax_input=''
wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>The surface is only being scratched when it comes to how the Internet of Things (IoT) will affect our lives. But Cisco Jasper has taken a major step toward enabling enterprises of all sizes to explore what that future might look like.</p><p>At Cisco Live! in Las Vegas, Cisco Jasper revealed its <a href="https://www.jasper.com/products" target="new">new Control Center 7.0 platform</a>. The solution is multi-tiered so that businesses, regardless of size or how far along they are in the development, can be empowered to get their applications off the ground.</p><p>Cisco Jasper has seen its customers grow from 3,500 to 11,000 in the past year. Despite that growth, the company found that <a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content" target="new">60% of IoT initiatives</a> still get hung up at the proof-of-concept phase. It designed Control Center 7.0 to help customers get over that all-important hump.</p><p>"We first introduced our Control Center IoT connectivity management platform to the market over 10 years ago, and since then it has become the largest IoT platform with over 43M devices being managed today, and more than 1.5M new devices being added per month," Jahangir Mohammed, general manager of IoT at Cisco Control Center 7.0, wrote in a <a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content" target="new">statement</a>. "What we&apos;ve learned from enabling IoT success for our 11K customers is that companies have different needs at different stages of their IoT journey."</p><p>To address those needs, Control Center 7.0 offers multi-tiered solutions and premium services designed to provide greater flexibility to customers. True to its name, Control Center 7.0 offers greater control. Two of the new premium services available to customers are Threat Protection & Smart Security (TPSS) and Traffic Segmentation that will allow customers to be better protected and better equipped for different revenue models.</p><p>TPSS is designed to protect against the malware and other cybersecurity threats that are as much a concern for end users as they are for developers. End users will be hesitant to adopt IoT applications if they feel their security could be compromised, so Cisco Jasper designed Control Center 7.0 to identify and analyze threats via the network, including when WiFi is being used. The security capabilities are further enhanced with closed user groups, two-factor authentication, and whitelisting features. There is also a user audit trail so that there is better tracking of user actions.</p><p>Traffic Segmentation provides clearer visibility for developers to know exactly how their services are being utilized. By enabling data traffic and usage information to be segmented, enterprises can generate sharper, more granular insights into their business and utilize those insights to do everything from developing new services that add value to more accurately billing back third parties.</p><p>And while earlier Control Center editions ran exclusively on traditional cellular services, Control Center 7.0 now has the ability to support low-power devices via LTE-M and NB-IoT that can reduce connectivity costs and extend battery life. </p><p>Control Center 7.0 highlights the core capabilities that Cisco hoped to grow when it acquired Jasper last year. "When we acquired Jasper, we made a promise to the industry that Cisco and Jasper would be more than the sum of our separate parts -- that we would create something better together," Rowan Trollope, senior vice president and general manager of IoT and Applications at Cisco, wrote in a statement. "This is the realization of that promise."</p><p>The new platform is available now, which means it&apos;s only a matter of time before we start seeing the applications that enterprises use the software to create. Because as great as the potential for IoT is, it is very much contingent on the platform the technology sits on. And with Control Center 7.0, developers now have a solution that could rapidly advance the timetable of their projects.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Cisco Jasper Control Center 7.0: The IoT Platform for Everyone' --post_excerpt='Cisco Jasper announced its new Control Center 7.0 IoT platform at Cisco Live! in Las Vegas.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Cisco Jasper Control Center 7.0: The IoT Platform for Everyone' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-07-06 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-07-06 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,6,9" --tags_input='Cisco, Jasper, IoT, internet of things, cybersecurity, enterprise solutions' --tax_input=''

The minivans are being used as part of a ride-hailing service that Waymo is testing in the city with volunteers. Residents in the Phoenix area who sign up and are accepted to Waymo&apos;s <a href="https://waymo.com/apply/" target="new">early rider program</a> are able to use the minivans to help them get around, whether that&apos;s commuting to the office or dropping kids off at soccer practice. In exchange for rides, volunteers in the program provide Waymo&apos;s team with feedback about the self-driving cars that the company will use to improve its service and technology.</p><p>"With members of the public using our growing fleet of self-driving cars, our vehicles need standard maintenance and cleaning so they&apos;re ready for our riders at any time of the day or night," Waymo CEO John Krafcik told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/alphabet-inks-deal-for-avis-to-manage-self-driving-car-fleet" target="new">Bloomberg</a>. "Avis Budget Group is an ideal partner to provide fleet support and maintenance. With thousands of locations around the world, Avis Budget Group can help us bring our technology to more people, in more places."</p><p>In expanding the early rider program, Waymo added 500 new self-driving Pacifica minivans to its fleet of 100 that were already being tested on public roads. All the vehicles are owned by Waymo, but under the new agreement -- financial terms of which were not disclosed -- Avis will be responsible for servicing and storing them.</p><p><a href="http://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/" target="new">Avis</a> is not buying any additional real estate, but will retrofit existing properties in the Phoenix area to accommodate the special needs of the autonomous cars, such as installing special tents to prevent them from getting rained on. Avis will also provide standard vehicle servicing, including oil changes, cleaning and tire rotation. The rental car company will not, however, be responsible for maintaining the tech hardware in the Waymo minivans, including the Lidar sensors that help the car measure its distance from surrounding objects.</p><p>Since Waymo vehicles don&apos;t need to be taken out of service to accommodate human concerns such as driver fatigue, the company expects its cars to be on the road much more than a standard one. The additional driving time will therefore require additional maintenance.</p><p>The partnership, according to Bloomberg, is the first major one involving management of driverless vehicle fleets, allows Avis to gain a foothold in an industry that has the potential to disrupt the traditional rental car model.</p>"It&apos;s important for us to get involved now," Avis Chief Executive Officer Larry De Shon told the publication. "This just demonstrates that we can extend our business into fleet-management-as-a-service."</p><p>For Alphabet and Waymo, the deal gives them access to a large network of cars and customers. While the current partnership is limited to the driverless Pacificas in Phoenix and is not exclusive, being aligned with Avis could provide Waymo with an easier way to add its technology to a greater number of vehicles in the future. Additionally, Avis owns the on-demand rental car company <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/" target="home">Zipcar</a>, which has more than 1 million members, and the door is open to potentially expanding the deal in the future.</p><p>The current agreement was hatched relatively quickly, with formal negotiations getting underway in January.

The influx of cash follows Swift&apos;s $11 million Series A round from 2015 and raises the company&apos;s total fundraising tally to over $47 million.</p><p>Eclipse and First Round Capital also joined in the latest round.</p><p>Swift Navigation specializes in Real Time Kinematics (RTK) GPS technology, which can accurately track global positioning all the way down to the centimeter. The company offers two products, both of which act as sensors and GPS receivers for various types of devices. The first, known as the Piksi, has applications in autonomous vehicle guidance, general and industrial robotics, aerial drones, precision agriculture and marine positioning. The second, the Duro, is "a <a href="https://www.swiftnav.com/duro" target="new">ruggedized version</a> of the Piksi." With a military-grade, weatherproof enclosure, the Duro thrives in tracking vehicles that operate in particularly tumultuous environments. The company&apos;s most recent round of fundraising comes on the tails of Swift&apos;s introduction of the Duro <a href="http://mil-embedded.com/news/carnegie-robotics-swift-navigation-showcase-duro-a-gnss-receiver-at-xponential-2017/" target="new">in May</a>.</p><p>The RTK tech used by both the Piksi and the Duro is 100 times more accurate than the GPS used by most smartphones, according to Swift Navigation, even though it uses the same components as cell phones for its products. This repurposing of already available technology gives Swift Navigation a leg-up in the marketplace, according to CEO Timothy Harris.</p><p>"This allows us to offer pricing at ten times less than competitors," Harris told <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/28/swift-navigation-raises-34-million-for-autonomous-vehicle-gps/" target="new">VentureBeat</a>. "For autonomous vehicles to become mainstream, the cost cannot be in the $10,000 range, but needs to be at a price point that can be built into a fleet of self-driving cars."</p><p>That $10,000 figure is at the top of a $7,000-to-$10,000 range in which most highly accurate GPS receivers are sold, according to Harris. The Piksi, meanwhile, retails for a mere $595. Swift Navigation has over 2,000 customers, a clientele that  ranges from companies designing self-driving cars to NASA missions monitoring ice and snow depth in various parts of the world.</p><p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.inc.com/helena-ball/2016-30-under-30-swift-navigation.html" target="new">Inc. honored</a> Harris and fellow Swift Navigation co-founders Colin Beighley and Fergus Noble, naming them to Inc.&apos;s 30 Under 30 list of young entrepreneurs.</p><p>"Although continuing to cater to a wide range of uses, including drones and robotics systems, Swift is now focusing the greater part of its efforts on automated driving and facilitating the achievement of target zero (or vision zero -- the international plan for zero automotive-related deaths -- and contributing to the advancement of autonomous transportation," according to the profile.</P><p>Swift Navigation was founded in 2012.</p><p>For New Enterprise Associates, Swift Navigation represents one of several investments in companies that specialize in assisting self-navigating vehicles.

The data generated will be analyzed in a central telematics server, which will then generate a "personal driving score" for users&apos; individual trips and their driving at large. It will also offer users specific tips on how to improve their driving.</p><p>All of this information will be shared with both W#UMLAUT#rttembergische Versicherung and the users.</p><p>For the insurer, this data collection and analysis could offer invaluable insight on the behavior of individual customers, as well as entire subcategories of their clientele. The driving tips that the app gives to users will seek to help them lower their premiums, according to Vodafone. However, it is unclear the extent to which an individual user could lower his or her premium through tracking changes in their driving behavior.</p><p>The partnership between Vodafone and W#UMLAUT#rttembergische Versicherung represents an early step in a larger trend of insurers adopting telematics technology. This past May, <a href="http://www.ptolemus.com/" target="new">Ptolemus Consulting Group</a> released a report predicting that by 2030, 50% of the world&apos;s vehicles will be insured through policies predicated on tracked usage. The report also projects that the number of usage-based insurance policies will grow to nearly 100 million globally within the next three years.<p>For <a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp" target="new">Vodafone</a>, the project has been a few years in the making. In 2014, Vodafone acquired Italian car technology company Cobra Automotive, which specializes in car telematics software, for #EURO#145 million ($165.4 million).</p><p>This is not, however, Vodafone&apos;s first telematics product offering. In partnership with Vodafone Automotive, Porsche offers a tiered subscription service called Porsche Car Connect that uses telematics to provide various safety services, including automatic emergency calls in case of breakdown or vehicle tracking in case of theft.</p><p>Vodafone&apos;s app will compete with other telematics insurance products such as <a href="https://www.allstate.com/drive-wise.aspx" target="new">Allstate&apos;s Drivewise</a>, which is a small device users can plug into their car&apos;s onboard diagnostic port to track driving behavior. Like W#UMLAUT#rttembergische Versicherung&apos;s new program, Drivewise offers users an opportunity to reduce their insurance premiums through safe driving -- by as much as 30%, Allstate says. Vodafone&apos;s new app will be collecting data from smartphone hardware, while Drivewise gathers it directly from the vehicle. Whether a smartphone can track diagnostics with similar accuracy remains to be seen.</p><p>For W#UMLAUT#rttembergische Versicherung customers under the age of 30, the possibility of saving money will serve as a worthy incentive to use the new app, especially since it&apos;s for a demographic that pays relatively high premiums for auto insurance. Further, those genuinely seeking to become better drivers may find the app&apos;s safe driving tips to be helpful. There is the potential that telematics technology could alienate some customers if, for example, less-than-stellar driving reports caused their premiums to rise.

A lot of the variables encountered on public streets quite simply don&apos;t exist. </p><p>That is why mining has become a rich seam for the deployment of autonomous vehicles.</p><p>With that in mind, Australia&apos;s <a href="http://fmgl.com.au/" target="new">Fortescue Metals</a> has taken another <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/fortescue-metals-to-automate-its-haul-truck-fleet/news-story/6d2b9babd4ddef26e5eadfee203b7489" target="new">significant step</a> toward making its fleet fully autonomous.</p><p>As part of its <a href="http://fmgl.com.au/media/3021/1685814.pdf" target="new">Innovation Projects</a> for the 2018 fiscal year, Fortescue announced it would be expanding its autonomous hauling technology at its Solomon mining hub in Western Australia and initiating the deployment of the autonomous tech at its Chichester hub.</p><p>Both mining projects are located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.</p><p>Fortescue first began using autonomous trucks to help haul iron ore in 2012 and now has 56 of these vehicles operating at the site. The trucks have led to an increase in productivity of 20%, according to the company. In the coming fiscal year, Fortescue intends to switch 12 more of the trucks that are currently driven by humans into autonomous vehicles.</p><p>The Chichester hub is another major mining operation for Fortescue, and the company has already begun upgrading its IT network at two mines in the hub to accommodate the rollout of autonomous haul trucks that will number approximately 100 vehicles.</p><p>Each conventional truck employs four drivers, so about 450 jobs will eventually go away as part of the transition. However, Fortescue&apos;s plan is to redeploy many of those workers into different parts of the operation in maintenance, technology and mine planning to offset the loss.</p><p>Fully shifting to autonomous hauling trucks is expected to take about three years. And when the move is complete, Fortescue will surpass mining rival <a href="http://www.riotinto.com/" target="new">Rio Tinto</a> as the single biggest user of autonomous haul trucks. Rio&apos;s fleet is approximately 20% autonomous and is made up of 73 self-driving trucks.</p><p>For Fortescue, the move is smart for several reasons.</p><p>As the price of iron ore has fallen, it has required the company to dramatically cut operational costs.

Designed for highway driving, ProPilot Assist is activated -- and deactivated -- by a switch on the steering wheel. Once turned on, ProPilot fully takes over single-lane highway driving until the car&apos;s human driver decides to take over. Using advanced image-processing technology, the system steers, accelerates and brakes as appropriate, going as fast as the user decides (within reason) while maintaining a safe distance from surrounding cars.</p> <p>As is necessary for all autonomous vehicle technology, the ProPilot Assist is prepared to deal with dangerous traffic situations.</p><p>"The ProPilot system automatically applies the brakes to bring the vehicle to a full stop," <a href="http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/nissan-s-new-serena-propilot-technology-makes-autonomous-drive-first-for-japanese-automakers" target="new">according to Nissan</a>. "After coming to a full stop, the vehicle will remain in place even if the driver&apos;s foot is off the brake pedal. When ready to resume driving, ProPilot is activated when the driver touches the switch again or lightly presses the accelerator."</p> <p>The fact that the technology is being integrated into the Leaf makes this a particularly exciting development, as the Leaf is already one of the most innovative cars in the market. First introduced in 2010, the Leaf is the best-selling highway-capable electric car of all time. Naturally, each new model year is eagerly awaited.</p> <p>The ProPilot announcement aside, little is known about the forthcoming Leaf.</p><p>However, according to TechCrunch, it&apos;s not the only groundbreaking advancement that could be involved with the latest model. "The redesigned version of [the Leaf]... is still &apos;coming soon&apos; and mostly still a secret," <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/23/nissans-propilot-driver-assist-features-coming-to-the-new-leaf-ev/" target="new">reports the website</a>. "We do, however, expect it to have around 200 miles of range on some models, which is more than double the current version."</p> <p>Between its pre-existing status as an electric vehicle and the forthcoming introduction of the ProPilot Assist, the Leaf will now be a big-time player in multiple emerging automobile markets. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15861240/nissan-leaf-propilot-autonomous-driving-sneak-peek" target="new">As The Verge reports</a>, Nissan is competing with the Chevy Bolt and Tesla&apos;s Model 3 for the sub-$40,000 electric cars market, and it is also a competitor in the autonomous vehicle space. In the latter category it joins, of course, there are plenty of other automakers soon to join the fray.</p> <p>Nissan has announced plans to introduce highway lane-switching technology as a feature of ProPilot as soon as 2018, which would essentially make equipped vehicles fully autonomous while on the highway.</p><p>Emerging autonomous vehicle technology that promotes safety, accessibility and convenience puts automobiles at the forefront of the conversation when we discuss the transportation of tomorrow.

By autumn of this year, First Transit and EasyMile plan to pilot an autonomous shuttle in San Ramon -- California&apos;s Bishop Ranch Office Park -- that will transport commuters between other transit options within the office park, including buses and bike-sharing services.</p> <p>Now, First Transit will have the opportunity to test its shuttle at the world&apos;s largest secure autonomous vehicle test facility -- GoMentum Station.</p><p>Owned by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, the 5,000-acre station offers the world&apos;s leaders in developing autonomous vehicle technology a state-of-the-art site for the testing of their products. The station&apos;s size allows for various types of terrain. Such a component is essential for developers of many autonomous vehicles. First Transit&apos;s shuttle will travel on pre-programmed routes throughout Bishop Ranch Office Park.</p> <p>First Transit will test two shuttles at GoMentum Station, and the agreement between the entities stipulates that First Transit will provide staffing, maintenance and support for the vehicles while testing them at the GoMentum. For First Transit -- or any other company -- having a large number of boots on the ground means increased opportunities for networking and potential collaboration with public and private entities.</p> <p><a href="http://gomentumstation.net/about/" target="new">GoMentum Station touts</a> that it is "bringing together automobile manufacturers, communications companies, technology companies, researchers and public agencies with the aim of accelerating the next generation of transportation technologies." The station breaks down the types of autonomous vehicles it provides testing for into three groups: private, shared and commercial.</p><p>First Transit&apos;s shuttle falls into that middle group, which may be the least discussed of the three.</p><p>As the time approaches when self-driving vehicles become commonplace on our roads, however, that dynamic may soon start to shift.</p><p>Early adoption of self-driving car technology will be prohibitive for the vast number of private citizens, while companies with large fleets of commercial vehicles will face a slow transition to AV technology for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Shared vehicles, however, seem like ripe candidates to be among the first self-driving automobiles on our streets. City buses, for example, travel premeditated, recurring routes, presumably making their programming easier than that of a vehicle that embarks on different trips each day. Consider the vast number of people that city buses transport within major metropolitan area, and the public funding of self-driving buses seems like an easy sell.</p> <p>Of course, if all goes according to plan, First Transit&apos;s shuttle will be in operation long before that day comes. If successful, the First Transit shuttle and other projects like it may be influential in improving the public&apos;s attitude towards self-driving vehicles. If people have daily positive interactions with self-driving shuttles in and around their workplaces, they will likely think more favorably of autonomous vehicles at large.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='FirstGroup Testing Self-Driving Passenger Shuttles at GoMentum Station' --post_excerpt='FirstGroup will move the trials of its autonomous vehicles to the proving ground in Concord, Calif.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='FirstGroup Testing Self-Driving Passenger Shuttles at GoMentum Station' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-07-07 14:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-07-07 14:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,5,6,7,8" --tags_input='FirstGroup, GoMentum Station, shuttle, bus, autonomous, First Transit, California' --tax_input=''

In a <a href="https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/us/pdf/2017/06/chaotic-middle-autonomous-vehicle-paper.pdf" target="new">recently published report</a>, titled "The Chaotic Middle: The Autonomous Vehicle And Disruption In Automobile Insurance," KPMG notes that the auto insurance sector could shrink by 71% by the year 2050.</p><p>That is a equivalent to a loss of $137 billion compared to today&apos;s market.</p><p>The report is a follow-up to a study that KPMG did in 2015. In the current iteration, the actuarial models were extended ten years, to the year 2050. The added time frame showed how the rate of change accelerated for the insurance industry.</p><p>"Insurance companies will have to make important strategic and tactical changes sooner than anticipated to navigate through this turbulent transformation of the industry," Jerry Albright, principal in KPMG&apos;s Actuarial and Insurance Risk practice, wrote in a <a href="https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2017/06/autonomous-vehicle-technology-could-shrink-auto-insurance-sector-by-71-by-2050-change-type-amount-of-insurance-sold.html" target="new">statement</a>. "New business models bring about a decade or so of a &apos;chaotic middle&apos; as insurers adjust their strategies and operations as autonomous vehicle technologies significantly deplete the need for personal auto insurance."</p><p>The biggest reason for the dramatic decline is the fact that as more and more autonomous vehicles take the road, it is expected that there will be fewer and fewer automobile accidents overall, which will result in fewer auto insurance claims.</p><p>Auto insurance is currently a $247 billion business, but KPMG&apos;s model showed that could decrease significantly because of a trio of factors:</p><ul><li><b>Safer cars</b>. Autonomous technology is expected to make cars increasingly safe. KPMG estimated that auto accidents could decrease by as much as 90%.</li><li><b>Transfer of liability</b>. The reason drivers need insurance is to protect them in the event of an accident caused by their own doing. If a driver rear-ends someone, the driver is at fault, but if "the driver" is a computer and a car is involved in an accident, the liability will likely shift to the OEM.</li><li><b>Mobility-on-demand</b>. We have already seen the widespread adoption of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. If those options become the primary way people get around, then there will be fewer individually owned cars on the road and therefore fewer individual car insurance policies.</li></ul><p>The study shows that by 2024, on-demand travel is expected to become the way that the majority of people get around in cities and surrounding suburbs, eclipsing travel by personal vehicle. By 2035, that type of travel will become the new normal. That will force insurance companies to develop new products and shift into new sectors in order to remain viable.</p><p>"As a result [of the disruption], auto insurers may choose to branch out into home-related products, or other commercial coverage, to benefit from diversification," Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG Corporate Finance LLC, wrote in a statement.</p><p>The autonomous vehicles will also require new types of insurance. One of the biggest issues in the space right now is cybersecurity and insurance companies could create products that protect against hacking of driverless automobiles.</p><p>The report notes that "transitions of this potential scale will not be smooth," going so far as to describe the events precipitating the change as the "perfect storm." But the transition will be even rougher if insurance companies fail to heed these warnings and keep conducting business as usual. The report concludes with a call to action that delineates steps that insurance companies can start taking now so that they aren&apos;t blindsided by the coming changes. These steps are:</p><ul><li>Understand the changing technology landscape</li><li>Understand your company&apos;s exposure to the change</li><li>Align with other insurers and form partnerships</li><li>Educate and train your people</li><li>Understand cost structures</li><li>Prepare your operations</li><li>Identify and monitor leading indicators</li><li>Evaluate your business strategy</li></ul><p>It would be wise for insurance companies to listen to this call to action, because if they don&apos;t their complaints about upcoming changes will fall on deaf ears.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Autonomous Cars Could Shrink Auto Insurance Industry' --post_excerpt='New research by KPMG highlights the dramatic impact autonomous vehicles could have on the auto insurance industry.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Autonomous Cars Could Shrink Auto Insurance Industry' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-07-10 08:05:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-07-10 08:05:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,4,6,8" --tags_input='auto insurance, insurance, autonomous vehicles, connected cars, mobility on demand, auto accidents' --tax_input=''
wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>While the evolving conversation about allowing self-driving cars onto our roads largely focuses on the technology of the vehicles themselves, far less of it takes into account the capacities and capabilities of our roadways.</p><p>However, if two UC Berkeley graduate students get their way that may not be the case much longer. Specifically, designated lanes for autonomous cars are a major key in unlocking the full potential of self-driving car technology, and these lanes could spell the end of traffic jams and allow for highway travel at speeds far greater than current legal limits, according to the students&apos; proposed project.</p><p>Anthony Barrs and Baiyu Chen represented Team Berkeley at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers&apos; 2017 <a href="https://www.aem.org/news/april-2017/video-winners-of-infrastructure-vision-2050-challenge-look-beyond-status-quo/" target="new">Infrastructure Vision 2050 Challenge</a>, taking home first place and $50,000 for a proposal they call the Hyperlane, a plan that would allow self-driving cars to travel at high speeds in designated lanes that would be constructed independently from -- but adjacent to -- existing roadways.</p><p>As with paid commuter lanes, owners of autonomous vehicles would pay to use a Hyperlane to access a road that would offer less congestion and the ability to travel at higher speeds. That fundamental similarity aside, though, the Hyperlane concept represents a complete departure from existing highway travel.</p><p>Using advanced sensors installed on the physical road in conjunction with a central computer system, the Hyperlane would control participating automobiles with 5G technology to shepherd them to their destinations at speeds as fast as 120mph. Connected to every vehicle, the central computer would arrange a traffic pattern that would create optimum efficiency and, of course, safety.</p><p>"We liken the Hyperlane network to an air traffic control system," Barrs told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/03/self-driving-cars-high-speed-lane-berkeley-california" target="new">The Guardian</a>.</p><p>Barrs and Chen estimated that, between the newly constructed roads, the on-road technology and the computer connectivity necessary to support a Hyperlane, such a project would carry a cost of over $11 million per mile.</p><p>While such an enormous undertaking would likely need heavy subsidies to be viable for construction, the two students devised a pricing plan that they say would make the venture economically sustainable. A dynamic pricing plan not unlike Uber&apos;s surge pricing would make usage of the road more expensive at busier times of the day (and vice versa), ensuring that the road would never be over- or under-used.</p><p>"Dynamic pricing ensures demand is distributed -- using price as the motivating incentive for users to use, or not use, the network," read a slide from Barrs and Chen&apos;s award-winning presentation, <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/08/self-driving-cars-hyperlane-2050/" target="new">according to <em>Fortune</em></a>.</p><p>When they first began researching transportation solutions, Barrs and Chen explored the possibilities of installing high-speed rail in the US. Once they determined that their biggest priority for their own proposal would be to connect disparate areas within major urban centers, though, they decided that a car-based proposal would be their best bet.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>As things stand right now, the self-driving car arms race is wide open. Seemingly every automaker is all-in on investing heavily in the production of autonomous vehicles, with many aiming to have products on the road within the next couple of years.</p><p>Ride-sharing services such as Lyft and Uber are seeking to establish fleets of AVs to shuttle their urban passengers from one destination to the next. At the same time, Alphabet -- the parent company of <a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp" target="new">Google</a> -- is designing its own self-driving cars, while <a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp" target="new">Microsoft</a> is looking to make sure its technology is present in self-driving cars of every make and model.</p><p>Even legacy rental car services such as Avis and Hertz are in the game, with these two companies forging partnerships with Waymo and <a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp" target="new">Apple</a>, respectively.</p><p>For the self-driving car industry and the auto industry at large, this is incredibly good to see. Healthy competition among companies fosters innovation, and everyone -- including the consumer -- comes out as a winner.</p><p>One group, however, would like to see more definitive "winners" in the race to get self-driving cars on the road: investors. With so many players involved in the autonomous vehicles game, traders have little idea which companies could net them a fortune and which may end up as duds.</p><p>Instead of merely rolling the dice on tech firms or auto companies that work on self-driving cars, investors are opening up their imaginations to ways in which other enterprises may see their business affected by a driverless world. Some estimates say that the elimination of driving will free up 600 billion hours annually for those who would otherwise need to keep their eyes on the road. Naturally, figuring out how those hours will be spent is a top priority for analysts.</p><p>"It&apos;s all about the adjacencies," Adam Jones, automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-05/go-long-chicken-wings-the-hunt-for-driverless-car-winners-is-on" target="new">told Bloomberg</a>. "If you invest in that, you&apos;re less likely to be buying an over-hyped situation."</p><p>Film and television are old stand-by industries that will certainly benefit from the usage of autonomous vehicles. Backseat VHS and DVD players have long been a staple of on-the-go children&apos;s entertainment in minivans and similarly sized vehicles.</p><p>Soon, without the need for eyes on the road, a two-hour drive can turn into family movie night. Solo commuters, too, will surely step up their watching habits in a post-driver world. The daily binge-watching of half-hour television series is already a regular habit of those who commute by means other than the automobile.</p><p>Elsewhere in entertainment, one already-emerging industry stands out as having much to gain from the widespread usage of driverless cars: video games. Gaming generated a stunning <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/21/worldwide-game-industry-hits-91-billion-in-revenues-in-2016-with-mobile-the-clear-leader/" target="new">$91 billion</a> in revenues in 2016, with mobile gaming easily representing the largest segment at $41 billion. It&apos;s not hard to imagine the same technology that will enable autonomous vehicles to share the road also allowing gamers to connect with one another from separate automobiles.</p><p>Food and drink is an especially interesting market space to watch as self-driving cars begin to hit our roads.</p><p>Producers and distributors of alcohol are surely thrilled by the possibilities that AV technology opens up for beer or liquor consumption in personal automobiles since it could eliminate the idea of drunk driving.</p><p>For food, the outlook could be slightly less rosy. Pre-set destinations and automated driving may reduce the number of impulse decisions that steer so many into fast food drive-through. However, self-driving cars also make eating in the car a whole lot easier. On-the-road restaurants that recognize this and innovate accordingly may find that they do better business than ever before.</p><p>Investors are right to be wary of any AV company that&apos;s billed as a "sure thing," as no company is predestined for success in this developing market. They should, however, apply that same logic to their investments located tangentially to self-driving cars.</p><p>Until the world of widespread autonomous vehicle usage is here, we don&apos;t know exactly what it will look like.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='What Will People Do in Their Cars When They Don&apos;t Have to Drive Them?' --post_excerpt='Without a clear autonomous vehicle leader, investment analysts are looking to tangential industries.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='What Will People Do in Their Cars When They Don&apos;t Have to Drive Them?' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-07-11 08:05:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-07-11 08:05:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,6,8" --tags_input='autonomous vehicles, investment analysis, Morgan Stanley, food and beverage, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple' --tax_input=''

PAVE proposes increasing that number to 100,000, a move that would widely increase the number of self-driving cars that would be allowed for testing on public roads. Real-road trials yield remarkably valuable information to those testing autonomous vehicle technology, and opening up such opportunities would accelerate innovation in performance and safety.</p><p>Dramatically increasing the number of autonomous vehicles allowed on the road in a single fell swoop has the potential to sway the public perception of self-driving cars in ways good and bad, and the House committee plans to make conscious efforts to ensure that the outcomes in that arena are largely positive.

The Disability Mobility Advisory Council Act would create a council whose job would be to do just that, while the Improving Mobility Access for Underserved Populations and Senior Citizens Advisory Council Act would create another council specifically to advise on how self-driving vehicles can best be of service to "populations underserved by traditional public transportation services," including senior citizens.</p><p>While such proposals from the public sector served as an encouraging sign for the progress of self-driving cars, so did a trend of collaboration among various private companies that are players in the emerging industry.</p><p>Two big-name players in AV development struck agreements with rental car companies, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/alphabet-inks-deal-for-avis-to-manage-self-driving-car-fleet" target="new">Waymo partnered with Avis</a> and <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/26/hertz-shares-soar-after-report-apple-working-to-manage-small-autonomous-fleet.html" target="new">Apple teamed up with Hertz</a>, gaining access to large fleets of vehicles and companies that have unmatched experience in managing them. Many have assumed that old-school rental car companies would be victims of the autonomous vehicle industry, so their active participation in it is good news for everyone.</p><p>Other announcements from the private sector brought further indication that the industry has taken off.</p><p>Chipmaker <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/06/27/nvidia-volkswagen-volvo-self-driving-cars-ai-intel.html" target="new">Nvidia will develop</a> deep learning software to improve environmental recognition in forthcoming Volvo and Volkswagen cars, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15792422/gm-self-driving-chevy-bolts-rides-roads" target="new">GM revealed</a> that 130 more self-driving Chevy Bolts will join the 50 that already cruise the streets of San Francisco, Scottsdale and Detroit.</p><p>Right now, June&apos;s seemingly ceaseless activity represents a high point on the timeline of autonomous vehicle development.

As the audience cheered, Li conversed animatedly with the event&apos;s presenter, describing the thrills of the self-driving car.</p><p>There was only one problem: Self-driving cars on Chinese roads are illegal.</p><p>The Beijing Traffic Management Bureau is investigating Li&apos;s drive, in which he rode alongside a man in the driver&apos;s seat who did not touch the steering wheel, accelerator or brakes, according to a report from Beijing Youth Today. The car did not appear to be fully autonomous, instead relying on highway-specific features that allowed the automobile to keep up with traffic and brake as necessary, including in emergency situations.</p><p>"The police support technology and innovation of autonomous driving, but it should be conducted legally, safely and scientifically," according to a Beijing Traffic Management Bureau statement. "Any violations of the law will lead to punishment."</p><p>While Li or his company may face some form of discipline, it is unlikely that it will rise to even the level of a slap on the wrist. As Chinese lawyer Ding Jinkun <a href="http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1000463/baidu-ceo-reprimanded-for-riding-in-autonomous-vehicle" target="new">told Sixth Tone</a>, the vagueness of Chinese laws that ban self-driving cars could result in Baidu being fined as little as 200 yuan, the equivalent of $30.</p><p>"The punishment will be too light because there aren&apos;t any laws to deal with this issue," Ding said. "The company should have asked for permission from the traffic authorities or tested the car in a closed-off area instead of on the highway. Even though there&apos;s no law yet, they shouldn&apos;t risk public safety, given that the technology is still immature."</p><p>Ding added that the vehicle used for the demonstration would likely be confiscated by authorities, in addition to a fine.</p><p>Baidu has actually partnered with the Chinese government to help shape laws and policy around self-driving cars, as the company looks to -- legally -- introduce its own such vehicles onto Chinese roads by 2019. Such a close relationship with the authorities is perhaps what emboldened Baidu to break the current laws for this conference. It&apos;s unlikely the company would have done so if it believed that it could damage their relationship with the government.</p><p>While Li&apos;s car-piloted highway drive got the headlines that it was surely designed to attract, the stunt may have had the side effect of overshadowing the significant announcements that Baidu made at their conference, which was billed as "Baidu Create."</p><p>The company revealed that Apollo, its autonomous vehicle platform, had forged partnerships with over 50 companies to work towards developing a self-driving car that would compete with the world&apos;s leaders in that space.

While <a href="https://www.einride.eu/" target="new">the T-Pod</a>, which will weigh 20 tons when transporting cargo at full capacity, will spend the majority of its journeys driving itself on highways, it will be remotely controlled by a human being when navigating urban destinations or other challenging environments. How exactly that remote control will take place is unclear. It&apos;s easy to imagine an arcade-style setup that simulates actually being in the vehicle, but Einride did not provide greater detail.</p><p>Further differentiating the T-Pod from other AV transport trucks preparing to enter the marketplace is its electric powertrain. <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Nissan&apos;s semi-autonomous Leaf</a> is an electric vehicle that will become available in North America later this year, but its status as a passenger vehicle is a far cry from the T-Pod prototype.

As seen in the photographs of Waymo&apos;s driverless truck, most current prototypes allow room for a driver who would navigate the vehicles during more difficult portions of a drive.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>In late June, Republicans and Democrats in Congress went to battle during a hearing when Republicans presented a draft package of bills that will establish national standards for testing self-driving vehicles.</p><p>Now, mere days later in July, House Republicans intend to introduce those same 14 bills to the floor, according to a spokeswoman for the US House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee.</p><p>The plan was to introduce the bill package this week and hold formal hearings on the bills next week, Blair Ellis, the spokeswoman, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-selfdriving-idUSKBN19W0YJ" target="new">told Reuters on Monday</a>.<p>For House Republicans, the bills are part of an ongoing effort to achieve two primary goals related to the regulation of autonomous vehicle testing. The first is to create national guidelines that transcend state borders, and the second is to reduce the amount of red tape that limits the number of self-driving cars on the road.</p><p>"We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines," said Representative Robert Latta, Republican from Ohio, in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-selfdriving-idUSKBN19I2I2" target="new">a subcommittee hearing</a> last month. "This isn&apos;t the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government making sure that industry can innovate."</p><p>In many cases, the goals of creating national standards and eliminating strict regulations are closely aligned.</p> <p>In California, for instance, companies such <a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp" target="new">Alphabet</a>, Tesla, <a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp" target="new">Apple</a> and Uber have spent a lot of time and money at the national and state level lobbying lawmakers to ensure that they can test their self-driving prototypes on the roads of the Golden State. And while the state has been generally <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/californias-finally-ready-truly-driverless-cars/" target="new">quite friendly</a> to the testing of autonomous vehicles, Republicans want to ensure that will always be the case by pre-empting future tightening of state regulations by establishing national standards.</p><p>Collectively, the bills present a great number of measures. The headliner, though, would give the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the ability to allow annual exemptions from federal safety rules for up to 100,000 vehicles. Part of those safety rules, naturally, require cars to have drivers; exemptions permit for the sale of self-driving cars. Currently, the NHTSA only hands out a maximum of 2,500 exemptions each year, so the proposed increase would allow for an enormous increase in the number of autonomous vehicles on the road.</p><p>On the other side of the aisle, concerns about safety hazards stemming from a lack of regulation have put some Democrats in opposition to the bill.</p><p>"We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority," Frank Pallone, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey, said last month. He worried that states would be unable to address pressing, unforeseen safety issues that could arise "without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in."</p><p>Also included in the bills are measures that ought to be appealing to members across the political spectrum. Several of the bills directly seek to make sure autonomous vehicles will be of particular service to the disabled and the disadvantaged. Bills such as the Disability Mobility Advisory Council Act and the Senior Citizens Advisory Council Act would not in and of themselves create policy, put instead establish their eponymous councils for advocacy.</p><p>It remains to be seen how the bills will fare once they reach the House floor.

Or do you swerve into a ravine, risking your own life in the process?</p><p>Whatever you do in this hypothetical situation, it&apos;s hard to think of it as a "decision." When faced with split-second situations on the road, drivers "react" more than they decide. It&apos;s because of that fact we rarely hold drivers accountable for ascribing any sort of logic to what they do when confronted with two devastating choices.</p><p>The same understanding won&apos;t be extended to autonomous cars when they are involved in accidents on the road.

Transportation analytics company Inrix recently announced that it will equip the forthcoming luxury sedan with a real-time parking service known as On-Street Parking.</p><p>The service will predict on-street parking availability in an expanding network of American and German cities.</p><p>From a resource and a technological standpoint, Inrix has emerged as a leader in this space. It pulls from the world&apos;s largest parking database in Inrix Parking, which has over 35 million parking spaces indexed in more than 100 countries. The available information goes even deeper in some locations, tracking real-time occupancy for over 20,000 parking spots around the globe.</p><p>At launch, the on-street parking service for the new BMWs will be available in seven German cities and nine in the United States: Boston; New York; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Phoenix; Seattle; San Francisco; and Los Angeles.</p><p>It takes a series of complex systems to synthesize, interpret and implement the knowledge provided by such immense amounts of data, and that&apos;s where Inrix claims its system will truly shine. On-Street Parking uses machine learning to predict parking spot availability in a specific location during a certain time of day. It works in conjunction with live information feeds that track spot occupancy in many of those locations.</p><p>In a survey that Inrix conducted, 72% of respondents listed real-time parking availability as their most-desired navigation feature for a connected car. Other navigation features mentioned in the survey include road incident alerts and re-routing, as well as city guides. Real-time parking availability was the second-most desirable connected car feature overall, trailing only stolen vehicle warnings and tracking.</p><p>"Real-time parking is the most sought-after navigation feature because it addresses a pain point that affects everyone," Joe Berry, vice president and general manager of automotive at Inrix, wrote in <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inrix-powers-the-worlds-first-on-street-parking-service-in-a-connected-car-300483707.html" target="new">a statement</a>.

Its sales figures tell the story.</p><p>At the beginning of July, the company announced that it has seen a strong surge in sales at its automotive division, known as Mobility Solutions, which makes radar systems and video sensors, as well as various other advanced safety systems for self-driving cars. Last year was a wildly successful one for Mobility Solutions, which grew 5.5% to achieve $49.8 billion in sales.</p><p>That growth is only going to get faster.

wp post create --post_author='Shaun Kirby' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>How many times have you purchased a new phone, only to find out the next hot device is right around the corner with even more bells and whistles? The same is becoming true when buying a new vehicle. With the pace of change in connected vehicle technology, the new car you drive off the lot today with the latest and greatest technology and driving features is well on the way to being obsolete tomorrow. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in the age of the Internet of Things (IoT), where vehicles connect to devices, other vehicles, infrastructure and myriad services.</p><p>Many automakers are unable to innovate fast enough to keep up with the pace of change, struggling to ensure the connected cars of today can connect with the new devices, networks and services of tomorrow, while remaining safe and secure. The challenge is compounded by the fact that both the IoT and the number of connected cars are growing exponentially. By 2020, the number of connected "things" is expected to reach <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3598917" target="new">20.4 billion</a>, while the number of connected vehicles on the road is predicted to hit <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-connected-smart-cars-2016-10" target="new">381 million</a>. Here are four ways to future-proof the connected car:</p><p><cite><b>1. Standardize for security</b></cite></p><p>The rise of new devices and connections also means the rise of new cyber threats for the connected car&apos;s massive attack surface. While we cannot anticipate all possible security risks five or ten years down the road, we can better prepare to combat them by standardizing in-vehicle networks. Instead of relying on the numerous siloed, heritage networks, each with different protocols and security strategies, automakers can future-proof the connected car with an Internet Protocol (IP) over Ethernet backbone architecture for in-vehicle networking. This enables the standardization of all communications that pass through the backbone, which analyzes and controls traffic.</p><p>With IP over Ethernet, the cars of today can seamlessly make way for new connections, while ensuring data security (and thus, driver safety). The technology not only allows automakers to utilize proven enterprise security technologies (including access controls, intrusion prevention and detection, firewalls, credentialing and more), but also makes the vehicle&apos;s architecture more agile. Automakers can essentially plug and play new sensors, devices and actuators as they come along, without the need to worry about incompatibility.</p><p><cite><b>2. Optimize bandwidth</b></cite></p><p>One of the biggest roadblocks to the evolution of the connected vehicle is bandwidth. Highly automated connected cars of the near future will generate prolific amounts of data (up to <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3147892/internet/one-autonomous-car-will-use-4000-gb-of-dataday.html" target="new">four terabytes</a> per hour). Although existing network technologies, like Controller Area Network (CAN) and Local Interconnect Network (LIN), may be adequate for basic telematics and control, they are not sufficient for next-generation connected car features and capabilities that are beginning to materialize. For instance, highly automated vehicles will need to be able to pipe high-definition video from multiple cameras to a central brain to avoid collisions and keep drivers safe. Fortunately, the latest Ethernet standards for automotive can increase bandwidth by a factor of 1,000.</p><p>However, future-proofing the connected car not only requires increasing bandwidth, but also using it more efficiently. Fog computing, which brings the cloud to the edge with distributed computers and storage, can dramatically help optimize bandwidth. Using configurable rules, fog computing technologies can determine what data to send immediately, versus what data to store or forward (perhaps when it is more cost effective). Edge analytics helps filter and compress the data so that only the most essential and actionable information is sent to a central brain in the car, or to the cloud.</p><p>Here are a couple examples of where fog computing would apply. When on cruise control, a vehicle&apos;s speed rarely changes. So, sending speed data to the cloud only when there&apos;s a change, instead of every fraction of a second, can save a great deal of bandwidth. Or when a car is at a stoplight on a desolate road, a single video frame may be all that is needed to understand the surroundings for automated driving or navigation. This uses vastly less bandwidth than a stream of high-definition video.</p><p><cite><b>3. Virtualize for agility</b></cite></p><p>A significant amount of computing power is required to provide the intelligence needed in the connected car, especially in highly automated vehicles. In fact, today&apos;s connected cars have the computing power of <a href="https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf" target="new">20 modern PCs</a> and feature about 100 million lines of code. Undoubtedly, as cars become more complex and more automated, more computing power will be necessary. Automakers can future-proof the connected car by consolidating computing power into a virtualized, centralized compute and service device that is expandable over time. This eliminates the complexity of relying on more than 100 individual computers onboard, as the various electronic control units (ECUs) are streamlined and consolidated by virtualizing some of their common logic. For example, automakers can centralize computer vision object recognition so that different ECUs controlling assisted parking, assisted steering and lane keeping (and eventually highly automated driving) are simplified. Each ECU does not need its own computer vision stack and computing power.</p><p>Through virtualization, automakers can also prolong the vehicle&apos;s life by making it easily upgradeable with more compute and storage to run the latest applications and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This allows for a more service-oriented architecture (SOA), which provides the flexibility needed to introduce new applications and services, thereby reducing future manufacturing and maintenance costs.</p><p><cite><b>4. Simplify management</b></cite></p><p>With tens of millions of vehicles connecting to numerous services globally, it will be impossible for automakers to manage the connectivity and performance of each one without automation and a unified view. To future-proof the connected car, automakers should adopt a centralized, automated approach to managing large numbers of vehicles and the services to which they connect. This can be achieved by IoT connectivity management platforms, which manage how and when a vehicle connects, and what it can do with its connections throughout its lifecycle. Such platforms can also provide monitoring and diagnostics, continuous learning and even self-healing. Moreover, they provide automakers and other members of the ecosystem with a unified view of information, as though they were looking at a single pane of glass.</p><p>With information on vehicle performance, service usage, security and more at its fingertips, an automaker can easily make informed decisions that ultimately provide better safety and convenience. For example, if an automaker detects a pattern of repairs that suggests a vehicle&apos;s drive train might have a design weakness, it can change the health monitoring telematics configuration of all the vehicles that have that drive train -- all with a single click from a cloud-based controller. Or, when a new security threat is detected, an automaker can see at a glance which vehicles are affected, and which need a software update or reconfiguration. It can then push out the updates immediately to mitigate risk.</p><p>While many of the cars of today may not be completely ready for the connections of tomorrow, automakers can jump on the fast track to innovation by leveraging proven enterprise technologies -- like standardization to IP over Ethernet, virtualization, fog computing and automation -- to future-proof their vehicles.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>While the self-driving car recently come to the forefront of American technological discourse in this decade, the underpinning technology that drives today&apos;s autonomous vehicles has been in the works much longer.</p><p>In the early 2000s, competitions like the AUVSI Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and the DARPA Urban Challenge incentivized engineers, designers and researchers to take on the challenge of creating autonomous systems.</p><p>Competing and placing in both of those competitions were teams from Virginia Tech University -- including a group that earned a million-dollar grant and placed third in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. Born out of those trials and triumphs was <a href="http://torc.ai/" target="new">Torc Robotics</a>, which stationed itself close by the Hokies campus in Blacksburg. For over ten years now, Torc has designed innovative solutions for a wide variety of commercial projects ranging from <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/autonomous-military-vehicle-called-guss-revolutionize-battlefield-2/" target="new">autonomous military vehicles</a> to <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/63796/saving-lives-on-the-move-aad16d2" target="new">robots that make mining safer</a> and more efficient.</p><p>Now, Torc is returning to the realm of self-driving cars for consumers, the same field in which it made waves in that 2007 challenge.</p><p>This month, Torc Robotics announced that it was developing a self-driving car system for consumer automobiles. All of the technology has been developed internally, including the essential localization, tracking and object detection systems that seemingly every automaker has been racing to build, as well as mapping and navigation systems built by Torc.</p><p>The company is not building the cars themselves. Instead it is creating technology that could, theoretically, live inside any make of vehicle. Although it&apos;s possible that Torc could find an exclusive OEM for its products, the company seems more interested in its current business model of catering to a wide number of clients.</p><p>"Our role is more of an enabler," CEO Michael Fleming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/torc-robotics-unveils-self-driving-system-for-consumer-cars/" target="new">told TechCrunch</a>. "We work with OEMs, tier 1s and tier 2s in the automotive space, taking our 10 years of experience and working with these organizations, outlining their road map moving forward. This is fairly new technology to a lot of the players in the automotive space, but this is something we&apos;ve been doing every day for the last 10 years."</p><p>Given Torc&apos;s years of experience with automated vehicles, it should come as no surprise that its car technology is already far along despite just recently announcing it. Two Lexus RXs equipped with Torc&apos;s system have been on public roads since February, with one of them successfully making a 1,000-mile drive from Blacksburg to Detroit.</p><p>With the company&apos;s origins rooted in self-driving cars, it&apos;s curious to see that it is now leveraging its technology to enter that market in earnest. So what took so long? According to Fleming, Torc was just waiting for everyone else to catch up.</p><p>"What we&apos;ve found is that some other markets that were early adopters to this technology, and there wasn&apos;t a great deal of interest in the automotive industry coming out of the DARPA Challenge," he told TechCrunch.</p><p>It&apos;s clear that Torc has long had its eye on the self-driving consumer car space, and that the company was strategic and calculating in choosing when to jump into it. The fact that an AV pioneer like Torc is once again working with automobiles serves as further validation that this is an exciting time to be involved with self-driving cars.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Torc Robotics Emerges as Serious Autonomous Vehicle Player' --post_excerpt='Based in Virginia, Torc Robotics&apos; experience working with autonomous vehicles dates back to 2007.

Road signs need to be differentiated from the horizon, and different types of road signs need to be differentiated from one another.

Sensor technology in autonomous vehicle prototypes has long been able to identify minuscule differences between separate physical entities. The issue lies in the machine having the intelligence to know exactly what those entities are, and how to react accordingly.</p><p>Enter Mighty AI.</p><p>The company&apos;s app works like this: Users are given an image of an on-road scene from the POV of a self-driving car&apos;s onboard cameras. Painstakingly, users move pixel-by-pixel throughout the photograph, labeling everything from pedestrians to cars to scenery to signage. They use a different color to draw boxes around each, and the end result looks like something out of a coloring book.</p><p>By cross-referencing millions of annotated images with one another, computers are slowly able to identify even obscure images from disadvantaged perspectives. The key word here is "millions." While machine learning technology lets software build upon its own knowledge, it requires an incredibly large data set first.</p><p>Considering the important role of the user information gathered by the app, Mighty AI has several safeguards in place to make sure it&apos;s getting reliable annotations from its users. To become eligible for paid "tasks," users must successfully complete a series of tutorials where they label parts of an image. Even for those users who are approved, there are further elements of accountability: Machine learning can establish which users are most precise and accurate in their labeling.</p><p>Mighty AI&apos;s applications are actually broader than the already enormous task of teaching autonomous vehicles: The company utilizes user data to educate artificial intelligence of all sorts. Founded as Spare5, it relaunched under its new name in January of this year, with a $14 million round of fundraising.</p><p>As seemingly every industry clamors for usable artificial intelligence technology, Mighty AI stands to have quite an effect across a variety of sectors.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Humans Teach AI How to Drive' --post_excerpt='Mighty AI is paying humans to make its artificial intelligence for self-driving vehicles better.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Humans Teach AI How to Drive' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-07-18 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-07-18 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,5,6,8,9" --tags_input='artificial intelligence, AI, Mighty AI, mobile apps, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, Wired' --tax_input=''

As industries mature, however, the businesses that are most successful in the space expand their market share and the overall number of players shrinks.</p><p>Karl Iagnemma, co-founder and CEO of AV software company nuTonomy, believes that the contraction in the autonomous vehicle space may be less than in other tech markets.</p><p>Iagnemma explained his position in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/07/11/driverless-tech-pioneer-predicts-multiple-winners-in-autonomous-car-race/" target="new">a recent interview with Forbes</a>. He spoke about the challenges of developing globally effective autonomous vehicle software and how those challenges can impact companies competing in the self-driving car space. His idea, essentially, is that the legal, geographic and cultural differences between various regions make it unlikely that any single company will be first to market in more than a handful of those regions.</p><p>"One of the dirty little secrets I would say, is that the software today is pretty city- or country-specific," Iagnemma told Forbes.</p><p>"I think we sometimes think that once one company gets the technology right then overnight we&apos;ll have autonomous cars on the road in every major city worldwide," he continued. "But in fact that&apos;s not the case. It&apos;s going to be a city-by-city, country-by-country rollout of this technology, which is going to take some time."</p><p>The CEO of the Boston-based company listed a few reasons why translating self-driving car software from one locale to the next would require adjustments, including differences in traffic laws and the varying physical appearance of road markings and signage. A dilemma that would require more nuanced problem-solving, however, is cultural differences. </p><p>"In Singapore drivers generally obey the rules, but the attitude around pedestrians is actually quite different," he said. "It&apos;s culturally different.

Other obstacles, however, are more obscure and most people won&apos;t be aware of them until long after the issue has been solved.</p><p>One of these obscure roadblocks was done away with earlier this month, as the US Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-unlocks-new-airwaves-vehicular-radar-use" target="new">expanded the amount of radio spectrum</a> available to connected cars on the road. By adding four gigahertz, the FCC effectively doubled the bandwidth available to vehicles&apos; radar applications.</p><p>Previously, cars only had access to the 24GHz band and the 76GHz band. Now, they will be able to use the span from 76GHz to 81GHz. The 24GHz range will no longer support connected car technology. </p><p>"While we enthusiastically harness new technology that will ultimately propel us to a driverless future, we must maintain our focus on safety -- and radar applications play an important role," <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/07/13/next-gen-car-technology-just-got-another-big-upgrade/" target="new">Mignon Clyburn</a>, a Democratic commissioner for the FCC, wrote in a statement.</p><p>Indeed they do. Radar technology is not only essential to the self-driving cars of tomorrow. It already operates many of the functions of semi-automated cars that are on the road today. Radars guide automated braking, pedestrian detection, self-parking features, and lane change warnings, among other components.</p><p>"Vehicular radar systems can improve our driving experience and help our families stay safe," <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/fcc-expands-us-connected-car-spectrum-allocation/" target="new">FCC chairman Ajit Pai</a> wrote in a statement. "Access to this contiguous block of spectrum will allow for new innovations and the expansion of potentially life-saving vehicular radar technologies."</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, it will help manufacturers of connected cars make their technology transferable across national borders. Offering the 76GHz to 81GHz band to connected cars is consistent with the practices of other countries. By aligning itself with those international standards, the US is making life a lot easier for OEMs developing autonomous vehicle technology that does not need to be entirely revamped when it&apos;s ported to other countries. It&apos;s an especially significant development for an industry that many believe will take different shapes in different regions of the world.</p><p>"If you develop a technology that only works in a single city, where it&apos;s kind of optimized for a specific city, that&apos;s not really that exciting," nuTonomy CEO <a href="https://theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Karl Iagnemma told Forbes</a> recently.

Of course, they&apos;re not alone. </p><p>Silicon Valley power players like Apple, Uber and Google -- in the form of parent company Alphabet&apos;s Waymo -- have been keeping pace, if not pulling ahead. Autonomous vehicle enthusiasts are expecting spectacular results from each sector. However, consumers, at least for now, seem to have more faith in one over the other.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.alixpartners.com/insights-impact/the-fast-changing-new-automotive-ecosystem-is-leaving-many-players-behind/" target="new">survey of 1,000 drivers</a> in ten major American markets conducted by Michigan-based global consulting firm AlixPartners, finds that consumers are significantly more likely to trust innovative and disruptive over tried and true when it comes to self-driving cars.</p><p>In the survey, 41% reported that they would trust a Silicon Valley company the most when it comes to driverless car software. By comparison, 16% told researchers that they would trust a traditional American automaker the most.</p><p>This is disheartening for automakers, as they tried to associate themselves with self-driving technology. Sixteen percent is a significantly low number, even relative to the not-so-impressive 41% attributed to Silicon Valley firms.</p><p>A bright side for Detroit&apos;s auto manufacturers is that consumers simply might not be aware that these companies are working on autonomous vehicles. When asked to name a company working on self-driving car technology, 55% of respondents cited Tesla and 20% named Google. Only 12% named a legacy car company. While that still represents a problem for automakers, customer ignorance is a less daunting beast than active customer distrust.</p><p>For AlixPartners Managing Directors <a href="https://www.alixpartners.com/our-professionals/john-hoffecker/" target="_blank">John Hoffecker</a> and <a href="https://www.alixpartners.com/our-professionals/mark-wakefield/" target="new">Mark Wakefield</a>, who led the study, a big takeaway was that the self-driving car industry will ultimately be unable to accommodate the bevy of participants currently striving to succeed in the space.</p><p>"There are more than 50 creditable companies that are trying to develop an autonomous vehicle system... and a lot of them are wasting money right now," <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/07/12/driverless-cars-future/472482001/" target="new">Wakefield wrote in the report</a>.

The members of the subcommittee drafted this legislation and, now that it&apos;s been approved, the House Energy and Commerce Committee at large could vote on the bill as early as next week. If it receives another affirmative vote there, it will hit the House floor in September after a recess. Most believe the bill will receive revisions as it makes its way through the legislative process.</p><p>"While we have not reached a complete bipartisan agreement, the draft before us reflects true bipartisan negotiations," panel member <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-19/self-driving-cars-get-boost-with-unanimous-vote-by-house-panel" target="new">Frank Pallone (D-NJ) said</a>, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>The bill&apos;s two main goals are to get more self-driving cars on the road for testing, and to preempt states from creating stricter legislation that would tighten the ability of companies to pilot self-driving cars within their borders. With regards to the former, the bill acts aggressively. Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can grant 2,500 exemptions per year for individual vehicles to circumvent its normal safety standards which, among other things, require cars to have human drivers. Many of these exemptions are given to self-driving cars being tested in states like Michigan, Arizona and California. The bill passed by the panel would expand that number from 2,500 to 100,000.</p><p>With regards to the latter goal, <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF17/20170719/106309/BILLS-115pih-HighlyAutomatedVehicleTesti-U2.pdf" target="new">the bill</a> makes its intentions clear from the outset: "No State or political subdivision of a State may adopt... any law, rule, regulation, duty, requirement, standard... related to the design, construction, mechanical systems, hardware and software systems, or communications systems of... is identical to a standard prescribed under this chapter," it reads.</p><p>While the bill passed unanimously among both Democrats and Republicans in the subcommittee, there are critics on the outside who don&apos;t believe the federal government should undercut states&apos; abilities to regulate within their own borders.</p><p>"Preempting the states&apos; ability to fill the void left by federal inaction leaves us at the mercy of manufacturers as they use our public highways as their private laboratories however they wish with no safety protections at all," John Simpson, Privacy Project director at Consumer Watchdog, <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/newsrelease/consumer-watchdog-calls-california-representatives-oppose-congressional-robot-car-legisl" target="newk">wrote in a statement</a>.</p><p>Democrats are looking to ensure that the federal safety standards will be rigorous enough to erase some of those worries.

They may also be involved in accidents and lead to certain jobs disappearing. Recently, however, one prominent executive raised a possible outcome that few seem to have considered.</p><p>As the UK general manager for car-sharing company <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/" target="new">Zipcar</a>, Jonathan Hampson knows a thing or two about the streets of London. And when asked about how traffic in the city would change with the proliferation of autonomous vehicles, he brought up an interesting point.</p><p>"For autonomous vehicles to work for cities like London they can&apos;t be privately owned, it has to be shared ownership," Hampson told <a href="http://www.am-online.com/news/market-insight/2017/07/11/autonomous-cars-should-not-be-privately-owned-says-zipcar" target="new">Automotive Management Online</a>.</p><p>In the interview, Hampson said he feels that private ownership of autonomous vehicles will lead to greater traffic in busy city centers because people will be using the self-driving cars for individuals trips instead of shared ones.</p><P>At first instinct, his proclamation seems curious. If driverless cars are merely replacing our current, human-driven cars, why would the number of cars on the road increase?</p><p>The (theoretical) answer is ironic, in a way.</p><p>For those who are drivers now, riding in a self-driving car represents a more relaxed, convenient experience. In an automated automobile, one would hardly need to interrupt their afternoon workflow to run a quick errand -- heck, one would hardly need to stop eating their lunch.</p><p>The more convenient the concept of a car ride is, the more people will want to ride and, in turn, the more cars will be on the road, the theory goes. Self-driving cars would also allow newcomers onto roads. The elderly and the disabled would be able to ride in their own vehicles. Perhaps even children could travel to, say, soccer practice by themselves in a car. Looked at in that light, it is by no means unrealistic to predict that AV technology could increase the number of vehicles on the road.</p><p>Naturally, Hampson believes his company will be able to help solve this issue.</p><p>"Zipcar is the global leader with shared ownership so I think when the time comes we will definitely have a part to play with autonomous vehicles and making them available as part of our fleet," he said.</p><p>When it comes to making car travel convenient for those who don&apos;t own their own automobiles, Zipcar is already on the cutting edge. The company has over <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/press/overview" target="new">1 million members</a> worldwide, actively operating more 12,000 vehicles in 500-plus cities. Members can rent vehicles at inexpensive by-the-minute rates, picking up and dropping off their cars in "Zipzones."</p><p>In London, the company recently expanded its fleet from 1,500 to 1,800 with <a href="http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/fleet-industry-news/2017/07/10/zipcar-flex-one-way-drive-and-drop-car-club-service-launched-in-london" target="new">the introduction of its Flex program</a>. Flex offers users more flexibility, enabling them to make one-way trips within the city, whereas previously they had to return their cars to Zipzones.</p><p>"We believe that the freedom to be able to do any kind of trip, where you need a car without having to own one, has the power to fundamentally redefine urban mobility in the kind of sustainable way that will allow London to continue to grow and thrive," Hampson said.</p><p>For every car Zipcar UK adds to its fleet, 10.5 private automobiles are taken off the road. As the world -- and cities in particular -- grows ever more populous and folks become more conscious of emissions, there&apos;s no question that car sharing services will play an important role in the future of car transportation.

Referring to technology that records and transmits detailed, comprehensive data about driver behaviors and vehicular diagnostics, it is already hugely important in the automotive space generally and is likely to be even more so as more autonomous vehicles take the road.</p><p>It is perhaps most important right now in the insurance industry, where telematics is being leveraged into practical, groundbreaking platforms at an increasing pace.</p><p>That process was accelerated further recently, when <a href="https://www.octotelematics.com/" target="new">Octo Telematics</a> announced the launch of its Next Generation Platform. The Internet of Things (IoT) platform will allow insurance and automotive services to easily customize their own telematics products.

"Therefore, providing current and prospective partners the best of both worlds and democratizing access to valuable data analytics to drive further innovation of services for the insurance industry."</p><p>For auto insurance, easily available telematics technology is a game-changer with the potential to fundamentally change the industry. Hardware ranging from in-car diagnostics trackers to cell phone sensors are capable of monitoring driver patterns in speed, turning, braking and many other variables. Combined with GPS capabilities, comprehensive records of a driver&apos;s behavior can be generated. With the power of telematics, that data can be analyzed to determine how safe a driver is being and offer suggestions for what they can do to improve their driving.</p><p>Several such products are already on the market. For years, Allstate has offered the telematics-driven product <a href="https://www.allstate.com/drive-wise.aspx" target="new">Drivewise</a>. With the tagline "Drive smart, earn rewards," Drivewise uses hardware installed in customers&apos; cars to track driving patterns. Safe driving practices -- staying below 80mph, limiting late-night trips and braking smoothly -- allows Allstate&apos;s clients to earn rewards points.</p><p>Recently, Vodafone and German insurer Wuerttembergische Versicherung <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">partnered to offer a telematics smartphone app</a> to drivers under the age of 30. Using sensors on users&apos; cell phones to track their driving, the app rates users&apos; driving and offers tips to improve. Wuerttembergische Versicherung customers who are deemed safe drivers by the app can see their premiums drop.</p><p>Platforms like Octo&apos;s Next Generation Platform can enable more such products. The number of user-based insurance policies -- policies for which premiums are based on customers&apos; driving behavior -- is projected to reach nearly 100 million by 2020.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>If ride-sharing is not the single most significant automotive trend of this decade, it&apos;s certainly in the discussion. Many people order the ride that serves as their morning commute on a smartphone app every morning, hundreds of thousands are participating in the gig economy as drivers and "Uber" has become just as much of a verb as "Google."</p><p>Lyft, as Uber&apos;s main competitor, is a titan in the ride-sharing space and is therefore a very of-the-moment company. As the company recently announced, however, Lyft is just as concerned with the future as it is the present.</p><p><a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new">Lyft</a>  recently announced that it has signed a lease on a 50,000-square foot space in Palo Alto, Calif., which the company will use to develop new self-driving car technology. They have plans to hire hundreds of employees by the end of next year to help run the new division, but, according to Vice President of Autonomous Technology Luc Vincent, Lyft has already been devoting a large portion of its operations to the project for some time.</p><p>"We aren&apos;t thinking of our self-driving division as a side project. It&apos;s core to our business," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/technology/lyft-self-driving-car-technology.html" target="new">Vincent told The New York Times</a>. "That&apos;s why 10 percent of our engineers are already focused on developing self-driving technology -- and we&apos;ll continue to grow that team in the months ahead."</p><p>While the extent of Lyft&apos;s ambitions are unclear -- for example, it&apos;s unknown if the company is designing its own self-driving car -- one project is certain: an open-platform software that will leverage the data from the company&apos;s current ride-share operations to inform autonomous vehicle systems.</p><p>"With Lyft&apos;s open platform, the world&apos;s best car manufacturers and self-driving systems can plug into our network of nearly one million rides per day," <a href="https://take.lyft.com/open-platform/" target="new">the company noted on its website</a>. "Access to a diverse set of real-life scenarios helps partners develop their systems around actual experiences and behaviors. Smart dispatching ensures the right vehicle is always dispatched for the right routes and conditions."</p><p>The creation of an open platform reads as a savvy move for Lyft. With Uber operating alone in developing self-driving cars and competing directly with automakers, Lyft becomes the only major ride-sharing company willing to share its data with other developers. Through that lens, its data, already an incredibly hot commodity, becomes even more valuable.</p><p>"We want to bring the whole industry together with this, and we think there&apos;s a unique opportunity in time right now for Lyft to become a leader while doing it," said Chief Strategy Officer Raj Kapoor at an event announcing the initiative.</p><p>Clearly, Lyft has spent a significant amount of time operating in Uber&apos;s shadow, and, not surprisingly, a number of headlines have positioned Lyft&apos;s latest announcement as yet another "challenge" to Uber. Thanks to several missteps by Uber in recent months, as well as savvy operating by Lyft in the same timeframe, the gap between the two companies has decreased. <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/07/19/uber-vs-lyft-race/" target="new">According to Fortune</a>, Lyft&apos;s market share in ride-sharing has increased from 21% to 25% since February alone.</p><p>In a broader sense, Lyft&apos;s development of self-driving technology is yet another domino to fall, as it now becomes difficult to name a major company in the automotive sector that isn&apos;t involved in the development of autonomous vehicles in some form.

It&apos;s 5:30 p.m. and you&apos;re leaving a meeting in an unfamiliar part of town. You don&apos;t remember exactly where you parked, and you need to make it to the store before it closes. You don&apos;t know when the store closes, though, and you don&apos;t know how to get there from where you are. Of course, you can worry about that once you actually find your car.</p><p>It&apos;s a nightmare.</p><p>But it doesn&apos;t have to be that way. Imagine a situation where you&apos;re leaving a meeting in an unfamiliar part of town and you don&apos;t need to remember where you left your car, because your phone tells you. It also calculates exactly how long it will take you to get to the store -- your walk to your car included -- and determines whether you&apos;ll make it there before it closes. It&apos;s a stress-free evening (depending, of course, on how your meeting went).</p><p>The latter situation is what <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/" target="new">BMW</a> is hoping to give its drivers <a href="http://blog.caranddriver.com/bmw-connected-brings-remote-3d-security-cam-microsoft-email-integration-and-more/" target="new">with the Connected+ platform</a>.</p><p>"Connected+ offers a wide variety of features and services in addition to the aforementioned navigation features," according to Car and Driver. Much of its appeal comes from its ability to integrate the operations of the car and the cellphone, allowing users to switch seamlessly between their mobile device and the car&apos;s dashboard display without so much as re-entering their destination or changing the song.</p><p>Several years ago, BMW launched ConnectedDrive, a series of apps that allowed drivers to connect with their cars from their phones. In March of last year, the automaker consolidated those services into a single app known as BMW Connected, which let drivers send driving directions from their phone to their cars, remotely lock and unlock their cars and cool or warm their vehicles minutes before getting into it.</p>{image 1}<p>Connected+ incorporates all of those features and builds upon them. When driving to meet someone, users can have their car send an ETA to contacts synced from their phone. There&apos;s a more advanced version of this feature, where a URL can be sent to contacts that lets them follow the driver in real time using GPS. (This might be a little invasive for most, but one can imagine the parents of a teen driver finding it useful as a means of ensuring safety.)</p><p>Considering the anxiety that surrounds the ordeal of parking for so many drivers, many BMW owners will find relief in the related capabilities of Connected+, which shows users their parking options as they near their destinations. Another common point of driving stress is addressed by a different Connected+ feature, which recognizes when the fuel tank is running low, offers the driver several options for gas stations and integrates the resulting fuel stop into its ETA calculations.</p><p>That last feature is especially exciting for those invested in the future of automobiles, as its interpretation of diagnostic information -- from the gas tank, in this instance -- into driving solutions represents the type of functionality that many believe will come to define the connected car. Thanks to Connected+&apos;s nature as a platform, there&apos;s reason to believe that more such offerings are on the way: BMW plans to update or add to the service at least once every two weeks.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Control Your Car From Your Phone With BMW Connected+' --post_excerpt='BMW&apos;s new connected car platform offers enhanced navigation features.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Control Your Car From Your Phone With BMW Connected+' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-07-24 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-07-24 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,4,8" --tags_input='BMW, connected car, autonomous vehicles, self-driving car, GPS, navigation' --tax_input=''

It will be a large facility, taking up 20,000 square feet. Three people have already been hired for the new production facility, including a plant manager, and 12 more employees will be brought in to staff the operation, The facility won&apos;t operate like a traditional auto plant, according to Navya Vice President of Sales Henri Caron.</p><p>"We are not a car manufacturer," he told Michigan Live.

The two shuttles that will operate this year cost the University about $500,000, money that it received from industry partners in exchange for research access.</p><p>"Today we are concentrating on Michigan, but we already have customers in Nevada," Caron said.</p><p>For any company looking to test or operate self-driving vehicles, not just Navya, Michigan is a natural place to start.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>In February, Embark CEO Alex Rodrigues laid out some ambitious plans for his company in the months that lay ahead.</p><p>"The big thing for us is going to be hiring more people," Rodrigues told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/24/14713700/embark-self-driving-truck-tractor-trailer" target="new">The Verge</a>. "We&apos;re scaling up really aggressively and bringing on more people to really get into every nook and cranny of the edge cases."</p><p>That mission just got a lot easier for <a href="http://embarktrucks.com/" target="new">Embark</a>, as the company announced July 18 that it had raised $15 million in a Series A financing round led by venture capital fund Data Collective. Also joining in the round were Maven Ventures, YC Continuity and SV Angel.</p><p>Previously, Embark&apos;s seed round included Maven Ventures, among others. The company&apos;s valuation now sits at $75 million.</p><p>Embark doesn&apos;t concern itself with building trucks or the self-driving hardware that would direct them, but rather on the underlying software and the platform that will enable them to operate autonomously. The company built its first test prototype attached to a Peterbilt 579 truck and put it on the road in Nevada last year.</p><p>At the same time the company announced its Series A financing, Embark also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/self-driving-truck-startup-embark-raises-15m-partners-with-peterbilt/" target="new">a formal partnership with Peterbilt</a>. The trucking giant will now be building the test trucks for Embark at Peterbilt&apos;s Texas factory. The partnership will allow Embark to have trucks more customized for its platform. </p><p>The appeal of self-driving freight trucks is obvious. The absence of human drivers eliminates the need to stop for sleep, food or fuel. (They&apos;d carry enough fuel for any given journey, refueling once they reached their destination.) Deliveries would be faster and performed with more efficiency, thereby making them considerably more profitable.</p><p>Of course, not everyone is so happy about the impending revolution in long-haul trucking.</p><p>In the US, there are 1.6 million drivers operating tractor-trailer trucks on the roads. <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state" target="new">According to NPR</a>, it&apos;s the most common job in more than half of the 50 states. It would not be an overstatement to say that all of these people losing their jobs over the course of, say, a decade would be catastrophic to the American job market -- not to mention similar effects in other countries.</p><p>Embark, though, has no intentions of replacing truck drivers. They merely plan to use them differently. The majority of a truck&apos;s trip would be self-directed, as the truck would drive itself on the highway. For autonomous vehicles, though, many consider city driving to be a far greater challenge. To address this, drivers would pick up Embark-driven trucks at stations on the highway just outside of cities, driving them manually to drop off their freight at their final destination.</p><p>Perhaps counterintuitively, Rodrigues believes such a change would benefit drivers.</p><p>"Our expectation is that the salary for truck drivers will go up," Rodrigues said in The Verge interview. According to him, "Interactions with the customer, individual pickup and drop off, and the harder parts of truck driving," are all skills that would make drivers remain valuable in the new trucking economy.</p><p>Embark&apos;s website espouses the company&apos;s blue collar spirit. "Something critical is lost when invention becomes untethered from the garage," it reads. "While others spend billions to develop self-driving on large corporate campuses, we believe that teamwork, passion, and an intense focus on the users of our technology will win out over raw size."</p><p>Having a plan for truckers to maintain their jobs will certainly endear Embark to many currently in the industry, and such a garage mentality doesn&apos;t hurt, either. When self-driving truck companies look to take their products to the road, those with unions and drivers on their side could hold a distinct advantage.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Autonomous Truck Startup Embark Raises $15M, Partners With Peterbilt' --post_excerpt='Embark&apos;s unique approach to integrating autonomous systems with human drivers is attracting a lot of attention and capital.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Autonomous Truck Startup Embark Raises $15M, Partners With Peterbilt' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-07-25 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-07-25 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,7,9" --tags_input='Embark, Peterbilt, trucking, autonomous trucks, venture capital, Data Collective, Series A, financing' --tax_input=''

Those who are interested in autonomous vehicles, though, should get to know Baidu because it&apos;s emerging as a global leader in the self-driving car sector due to its innovation.</p><p>That status was further cemented earlier this month, when Baidu announced that <a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp" target="new">Microsoft</a> would become a major contributor to Baidu&apos;s Apollo platform. This "Apollo program" refers to an autonomous vehicle platform that addresses the major functionalities of self-driving cars: perception of surroundings and route planning, among others. Microsoft joins a list of partners for Baidu&apos;s Apollo that has grown to over 50 and includes heavy hitters such as Daimler, Ford, Bosch, Nvidia and ZF.</p><p>"[Apollo] has gained a lot of momentum since April and we have gained a lot of partners around the world. ... two thirds from within China, one third from outside of China," Ya-Qin Zhang, Baidu&apos;s president of technology, emerging business and global business operations, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/07/18/baidus-apollo-lifts-off-microsoft-taking-open-source-robocar-project-global/" target="new">told Forbes</a>. "We want to extend this to the world and believe this whole technology can be shared by China, and that&apos;s why we partnered with Microsoft."</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about Apollo is its status as an open source platform, meaning that any third party can contribute to it, not just official partners of Baidu. Being open source means that manufacturers can easily incorporate their own existing systems and technologies into it. Baidu, however, is not being cavalier with the platform.</p><p>"We will make sure this moves very fast and very efficiently, but also is inclusive and open," said Zhang. "We want to make sure all the contributions are high quality. The more data they put in, the more software they put in, there&apos;s exponentially more they actually can get back."</p><p>For Microsoft, the new partnership with Baidu is a natural continuation of the approach Redmond has taken towards autonomous vehicles. Unlike other tech giants, the software giant is not attempting to manufacture its own cars.</p><p>"We&apos;re not in a position to deliver [self-driving cars] end-to-end," Microsoft Corporate Vice President Kevin Dallas <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-baidu-apollo-self-driving-cars-2017-7" target="new">told Business Insider</a>.</p><p>But that&apos;s not to say that Microsoft isn&apos;t heavily involved in the AV space.</p><p> In fact, the company has become somewhat of a leader in developing the software and technologies needed to power these vehicles. In 2015, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/20/microsoft-volvo-strike-deal-to-make-driverless-cars.html" target="new">it struck a deal with Volvo</a> to work on technology to power the Swedish automaker&apos;s cars.</p><p>For Baidu and Apollo, Microsoft will bring a level of security and artificial intelligence that are unparalleled on the platform.

Leading up to the vote, it&apos;s likely that many lawmakers heard radio ads encouraging them to back the measure.</p><p>However, the source of the ad was neither the large corporations developing self-driving cars, nor the lobbies that represent them.</p><p>It was the National Federation of the Blind.</p><p>The radio spots were the continuation of a trend of organizations that represent disabled people <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-19/blind-drivers-step-up-to-shape-u-s-push-for-driverless-cars" target="new">advocating for government assistance in accelerating the development of self-driving cars</a>. It&apos;s easy to understand why: self-driving cars would mean far greater freedom for the elderly, blind and other disabled individuals who are unable to drive themselves.</P><p>People with disabilities wouldn&apos;t have to rely on others for trips to the grocery store or the doctor or to visit friends and relatives.

The Coalition was founded by Ford, Volvo, Uber, Waymo and Lyft -- a group of competitors with a shared interest in clearing the way for self-driving cars to take the road.

Even the most advanced businesses in this market have a long way to go before perfecting their products.</p><p>Additionally, there&apos;s plenty of uncertainty around when legislation will make our autonomous vehicle future a reality, and how specific rules and regulations will shape that landscape. Further, it&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess what that future will look like from a business perspective. Will legacy automakers achieve vertical integration for the production of self-driving cars, or will Silicon Valley disrupters claim the space as their own?</p><p>Even with all this uncertainty, it hasn&apos;t prevented money from flowing in as evidenced by auto tech startup <a href="https://www.nauto.com/" target="new">Nauto</a>&apos;s recent announcement of <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/7/19/15992974/self-driving-driverless-car-tech-nauto-greylock-softbank-reid-hoffman" target="new">a $159 million Series B financing round</a>.</p><p>The round was led by Silicon Valley VC firm Greylock Partners and Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank Group. Toyota AI Ventures, General Motors Ventures and BMW iVentures also participated, as did the insurance company Allianz Group.</p><p>While the company is reportedly using its partnerships with Toyota, GM and BMW to develop self-driving car technology, the chatter attached to the recent fundraising focused on Nauto&apos;s current portfolio of products, as well as how the company can make roads safer today.</p><P>Nauto uses inward-facing car cameras, advanced AI technology, and analytic coaching software to track driving behavior and help correct it. The technology is especially adept at detecting -- and, eventually, correcting -- distracted driving.</p><p>"SoftBank and Greylock, along with our key strategic partners, are turbo-charging Nauto&apos;s ability to make roads safer today and to create an onramp to autonomy for the near future," <a href="https://www.nauto.com/newsroom/autonomous-vehicle-company-nauto-raises-159-million-series-b-round-led-by-softbank-and-greylock-partners" target="new">Stefan Heck</a>, Nauto&apos;s founder and CEO, wrote in a statement. </p>"At a time when traffic fatalities are climbing and distracted driving causes more than half of all crashes, we&apos;re tackling that problem by putting Nauto&apos;s safety features into more commercial fleet vehicles -- from trucks and vans to buses and passenger cars -- to warn drivers and coach them on how to stay focused," Heck added. "And, in pursuit of the profoundly transformational impact autonomous vehicle technology can have on business and society, we&apos;ll now more rapidly be able to gather the billions more miles of real driving experience and data required to get a precise understanding of how the best drivers behave behind the wheel."</p><p>"In the future, driving will be a networked activity, with tighter feedback loops and a much greater ability to aggregate, analyze and redistribute knowledge," Greylock partner Reid Hoffman wrote. "By building a network of vehicles and drivers, Nauto is accelerating the transition from a human-driver dominant world to a safer, more efficient autonomous-driving era."</p><p>Both Hoffman and SoftBank partner Shu Nyatta will join the Nauto board.</p><p>As Allianz Group&apos;s involvement suggests, Nauto&apos;s products also raise intriguing possibilities for insurance companies.</p><p>Nauto&apos;s software could help drivers lower their premiums by teaching them to drive safer, and the video and data generated by the company&apos;s cameras could help insurers handle accident claims more effectively.</p><p>We&apos;re currently in something of a transitional moment, where limited testing of self-driving car technology can take place on open roads, but no one has much of an idea when autonomous vehicles will achieve widespread consumer adoption.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is considering a proposal to make the inclusion of vehicle-to-vehicle technology compulsory in all cars manufactured starting in 2023. That confluence of events has M2M technology poised for takeoff.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/machine-to-machine-market-732.html" target="new">a new study</a> by research firm Markets and Markets, the wireless technology market is set to experience its highest period of compound annual growth (CAGR) between 2017 and 2023, as the still-young market matures into a powerhouse.</p><p>M2M technology represents a particularly promising subsector of this industry, as the report predicts that it will experience a CAGR of 4.6% during that time, which would lead it to become a market worth $27.62 billion by 2023.</p><p>The report takes a broad scope, zeroing in on various wireless markets around the world and examining how varying technological infrastructures, regulatory environments and social conditions are changing the market. It covers a broad swath of industries, including healthcare, utilities, retail, consumer electronic, security and surveillance. But the report focuses heavily on auto and transportation, as this represents wireless technology&apos;s most fruitful end-user industry going forward.</p><p>"The automotive and transportation sector held the largest share of the M2M connections market compared to other end-user industries in 2016," <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/machine-to-machine1.asp" target="new">a summary of the report</a> states. "The increase in the demand for embedded telematics in cars and Wi-Fi-based GPS trackers for remote fleet monitoring, coupled with Bluetooth in-car connectivity for vehicle infotainment, is expected to drive the growth of the wireless M2M connections market for the automotive and transportation end-user industry."</p><p>The reason why the automotive industry represents such a promising market for wireless technologies is so obvious that it often goes unstated.</p><p>Perhaps more than any other consumer or industrial product that incorporates electronics, cars are fundamentally "wireless." Up until recently, a car could not be "connected" in the way that a home, office, hospital or public space could be -- its very nature of being untethered meant that it couldn&apos;t latch onto wired, stationary systems.</p><p>4G and LTE technology has already eliminated that problem to a large degree, as navigation systems, music streaming services and more allow drivers to access technological services that were previously unavailable on the go.

(Okay, that last one could be a day-ruiner.)</p><p>For designers developing self-driving cars, though, figuring out how to program autonomous vehicles to recognize and effectively navigate environmental irregularities is one of the greatest challenges they face.</p><p>For former Tesla employees Erik Reed and Andrew Kouri -- as well as George Tall, who worked for iRobot -- it was a challenge they wanted to face head on. To do so, the trio founded mapping startup <a href="https://lvl5.ai/" target="new">Lvl5</a> in December and publicly launched the company in July.</p><p>"The thing that everyone is kind of ignoring silently is that self-driving cars won&apos;t ship unless we have really good HD maps that update every single day," Kouri <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/19/16000272/lvl5-self-driving-car-tesla-map-lidar" target="new">told The Verge</a>. "And nobody has a system to do this yet. This is what we&apos;re building."</p><p>Lvl5 is creating a system of three-dimensional, high-definition maps that the founders hope will become the baseline for self-driving cars navigating on public roads. In fact, they believe their maps can become a full-on replacement for Light Detection and Radar (LIDAR) systems -- the hardware that allows self-driving cars to "see" their surroundings in real time.</p><p>The Lvl5 team believes that the cost of LIDAR is prohibitive and supply is too low for autonomous vehicles relying on it to be built at scale.</p><p>Obviously, cars need to be ready to accelerate, brake or perform any other maneuver at a moment&apos;s notice. Lvl5&apos;s solution is to utilize cameras -- both to generate the map and to give individual cars a reading of their surroundings in real time. From the company&apos;s perspective, those things aren&apos;t all that different from one another, as crowdsourced footage from all active cameras on the road would establish live, constantly updating maps to serve as a navigational baseline.</p><p>"We fuse all that data together, and once we get a certain amount of passes on that road, we can start making maps on that road," <a href="http://jalopnik.com/meet-the-former-tesla-engineers-who-want-to-fix-self-dr-1797059589" target="new">Kouri told Jalopnik</a>.</p><p>If it sounds like an ambitious project, which would require vast amounts of data from many drivers to work, that&apos;s because it is. But Lvl5 is already actively addressing that problem, and its solution is paying off for drivers.</p><p>Payver is a smartphone app developed by Lvl 5 that allows drivers to record the road by mounting phones on their windshields. The app sends the footage to the company, which integrates the images with GPS data to build Lvl5&apos;s 3D maps. For drivers, the incentive is a payment of one to five cents for each mile of footage. More than 2,000 drivers -- many of whom are Uber and Lyft drivers seeking to make their driving even more profitable -- have already started to use the app in the three months since it launched, and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/19/technology/business/rideshare-drivers-camera/index.html" target="new">the publicity that Lvl5 has received</a> should elevate that number quickly.</p><p>While Kouri told The Verge, "We don&apos;t really care if LIDAR wins out or computer vision wins out," it&apos;s clear that Lvl5&apos;s success hinges on computer vision prevailing or, at least, becoming a viable alternative to LIDAR for self-driving cars.

They can jam out to pretty much any song in the world on demand with streaming music services like Spotify. And they can, of course, plug in a destination and have the car navigate them turn by turn.</p><p>All this functionality is impressive and, relative to the history of consumer automobiles, quite new. So many drivers probably aren&apos;t thinking about what&apos;s next in connected car apps.

The problem with the previous platform was that once developers created their apps, they had to travel in person to General Motors in Detroit to actually test them on vehicles. With Dev Client, app builders will now be able to see how their creations perform on their own GM vehicles.</p><p>"Sharing more emulated data points through the SDK than any other automaker was the first step in opening the door for developers," Kent Helfrich, executive director of Connected Ecosystem Integration at GM, wrote. "After such strong adoption of the SDK, we wanted to enable developers to take the next step and allow real-world testing in our vehicles."</p><p>While the new offering from GM opens up certain tools for third-party developers, it is not a completely open platform. Apps built in the SDK will still need to be approved before they can be tested in the vehicles. It is unclear what GM&apos;s standards are for app suitability and how rigorously they might apply them going forward.</p><p>The idea of collaboration in the connected car space has been a hot topic recently, with new partnerships between automakers, software developers and others announced on a weekly basis.</p> <p>nuTonomy CEO Karl Iagnemma spoke about the subject recently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/07/11/driverless-tech-pioneer-predicts-multiple-winners-in-autonomous-car-race/" target="new">with Forbes</a>.</p><p>"In the automotive domain, generally speaking, when you look at consortium models, the groups that have leading technology are less incentivized to contribute to the consortia," Iagnemma said. "There&apos;s a potential end state where you have participants that are not market leaders. And with a large field of participants that aren&apos;t leaders, there&apos;s no guarantee that just by combining resources they&apos;ll end up with a winning solution."</p><p>But the pursuit of an improved connected car infotainment system is a competition that looks like it may have many winners. Going forward, GM is going to include infotainment systems in a larger number of its cars, and inviting more developers to the table will yield more app offerings.

It is built to play nicely with other technology, regardless of make or model.</p><p>Still, for V2V to be successful, there need to be a lot of vehicles talking -- and listening -- to other vehicles. If only one car on the road has V2V capability, it can be a little like a tree falling in the woods. But if many cars have V2V, the potential for them to relay crucial information between each other is enormous.</p><p><a href="http://www.vw.com/" target="new">Volkswagen</a> is doing its part to make sure more cars are equipped with the technology.

But over time, the utility of the technology will grow. Imagine a scenario where one car detects black ice with its own sensors and then transmits a notification of the location of the black ice to other V2V-equipped vehicles or to municipal safety workers.</p><p>There will also be more immediate applications, mostly in the form of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) features. Most of these involve safety, which is always a concern with connected cars. The new Volkswagens will be warned of upcoming traffic hazards like accidents or construction sites, and the German automaker hopes to reach agreements with emergency services to help warn cars and drivers when ambulances or firetrucks are approaching.</p><p>Volkswagen is not the first automaker to introduce V2V to its vehicles: <a href="http://www.cadillac.com/" target="new">Cadillac</a> announced in March that its 2017 CTS sedans would come standard with V2V technology, describing similar safety features to the ones touted by Volkswagen. <a href="http://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2017/mar/0309-v2v.html" target="new">In its announcement</a>, however, Cadillac acknowledged that many of the uses for the tech were still to come.</p><p>"As an early mover, we look forward to seeing its benefit multiply as more V2V-equipped vehicles hit the road," said Cadillac Global Director of Product Strategy Richard Brekus.</p><p>Sometimes being the forerunner of an early technology can have its drawbacks.</p><P>A company could do all the heavy initial lifting, only to have others come in and reap the rewards. But being an early leader in the V2V space also gives automakers like Cadillac and Volkswagen early access to data, so they can see what is and is not working and act accordingly. Their actions can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p> If other automakers see what Cadillac and VW are doing, they may follow suit for fear of being left out, the effect of which would be more V2V-equipped cars on the roads.

Cyclists zoom by you on either side; taxi drivers honk their horns and scream at you when you&apos;ve done nothing wrong; and making a turn inevitably means maneuvering through hordes of pedestrians, many of whom are on their cellphones.</p><p>Of course, the challenges of driving in New York pale in comparison to commuting using the city&apos;s public transit, which lives -- and often dies -- on outdated and failing infrastructure. The transportation situation in NYC could clearly benefit from a technology upgrade.</p><p>It makes sense to imagine how driverless cars could improve the situation, and that&apos;s exactly what <a href="http://edgdesign.com/" target="new">architecture and design firm EDG</a> did with a new plan called Loop NYC. Aiming to make city driving safer and more efficient, the plan proposes a solution within the city&apos;s current grid layout to create autonomous vehicle-only lanes at some of Manhattan&apos;s most critical points of traffic.</p><p>"NYC, like so many urban centers, is facing an imminent infrastructure crisis as the continuous influx of residents will soon be insupportable," EDG founder and managing partner <a href="https://www.6sqft.com/loop-nyc-proposes-driverless-auto-expressways-across-manhattan-and-a-13-mile-pedestrian-park/" target="new">John J.

The West Side Highway and FDR Drive, the major roads that border the island on its west and east sides, would each hold two lanes -- one in each direction -- to accommodate autonomous vehicles exclusively. Major cross streets such as 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd, 57th, 86th and 110th Streets would become expressways for driverless cars only, allowing for incredibly efficient traffic patterns.</p><p>"We calculated the efficiency of Loop NYC to go from Grand Central to Lower Manhattan and back," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="new">EDG notes in a video</a> touting its proposal. "A route that would traditionally take 45 minutes now would only take 11 minutes. An average New Yorker would save 30 minutes a day on their commute, and over a lifetime would get back more than a year."</p><p>The plan also presents solutions for the city&apos;s pedestrians, who become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/nyregion/new-york-city-overcrowded-sidewalks.html" target="new">more and more tightly packed onto sidewalks</a> with each passing year.</p><p>Overpasses and underpasses would separate walkers from self-driving cars, easing congestion on street-level sidewalks in the process. An idea that will seem even more radical to long-time New Yorkers is a 13-mile "pedestrian park" that would stretch from Battery Park through Union Square before extending further up Broadway and Park Avenue. EDG&apos;s images of these parks <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90133918/could-driverless-cars-turn-manhattan-into-a-lush-pedestrian-paradise" target="new">are strikingly green</a>.</p><p>A million different technological, social and political factors will determine if and when a plan such as Loop NYC will be viable in Manhattan or other major cities.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>The potential for self-driving cars to make roads safer is immense.</p><p>There are some estimates that autonomous vehicles will reduce <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/self-driving-cars-could-save-300000-lives-per-decade-in-america/407956/" target="new">traffic deaths</a> by as much as 90%. Given the chance to reduce loss of life, it&apos;s hard to argue that self-driving cars shouldn&apos;t be developed and deployed as quickly as possible.</p><p>However, a deeper level of thinking complicates this logic. For example, the lives lost in self-driving car trials may pale in comparison to the lives they ultimately save, but that doesn&apos;t make it acceptable for deaths to occur during trials. Plus, there are those who are skeptical of self-driving cars&apos; ability to bring about the safety benefits that have been promised. It&apos;s a challenging ethical dilemma that currently lacks a dominant framework to address it.</p><p>But if you find Carnegie Mellon philosophy professors Alex John London and David Danks to be persuasive, that framework may already exist, albeit in a different industry. In an opinion piece published in IEEE Intelligent Systems titled "<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7851147/" target="new">Regulating Autonomous Systems: Beyond Standards</a>," the pair presented a compelling argument that autonomous vehicles ought to be regulated in the way that the US Food and Drug Administration tests drugs before approving them.</p><p>The need for such regulation, according to Dank, involves concerns of both safety and practicality. If early self-driving car technology performs poorly and endangers human drivers, it could hamper automakers&apos; long-term ability to get their autonomous vehicles on the road.</p><p>"In the case of drugs, we have pretty well established procedures for looking at, for example, when a drug has more negative side effects than anticipated," Dank <a href="http://jalopnik.com/ethics-expert-wants-self-driving-cars-approved-like-new-1797106098" target="new">told Jalopnik</a>. "There&apos;s a great risk if [driverless cars] are put on the road before we understand better how they&apos;re going to behave, there will be a number of accidents that will set back the possibility of these things being regulated in the right way."</p><p>The process Danks and London describe mirrors that of drug approval. "Preclinical trials" for self-driving cars would place them in various environments, record how they respond, and adjust their technology accordingly. The next step would be human-assisted voyages in which autonomous vehicles navigate roadways with a person acting as co-pilot. As these processes and more were completed successfully, regulations would allow for further integration of AVs into normal, everyday operations.</p><p>The argument can be made, however, that the horse(power) is out of the barn. Self-driving cars are already testing on roads by the thousands, and <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">legislation currently making its way through the House</a> would put tens of thousands more out in traffic. But Danks and London do suggest an approach and philosophy to new technology that can guide our actions going forward.</p><p>"Autonomous vehicles have the potential to save lives and increase economic productivity," <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/february/driverless-car-regulations.html" target="new">said London</a>.

Modern technologies that are now common parts of our driving experiences, such as navigation systems and music streaming services, generate data that offer valuable insight into consumer habits. And the car of tomorrow? It could very well be keeping track of your heart rate and body temperature, not to mention more abstract factors like your mood.</p><p>In a day and age where companies like Target have invested millions to figure out how to leverage data to determine, among other things, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html" target="new">when customers are pregnant</a>, seemingly every point of an individual&apos;s interaction with the world is mined for data. Internet browsing, cell phone activity and credit card usage are all sources through which data can be collected and analyzed.</p><p>One can imagine, then, how data generated from a connected car has come to be regarded as highly valuable. To put a "data point" on just how valuable, a 2016 <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/monetizing-car-data" target="new">report by McKinsey</a> estimates that connected car data could generate between $450 to $750 billion in the next decade.</p><p>"Artificial intelligence and big data will make vehicles one of the most important windows into the habits of consumers next to their own phones and computers," Edmunds.com Executive Editor Ed Hellwig, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/01/06/ces-2017-your-car-wants-to-say-hello-and-thats-only-the-start/" target="new">told The Washington Post</a> in January. "Automakers will know more than they ever have about how their vehicles are used, which could lead to entirely new designs and features."</p><p>Those who are designing connected cars -- a group that includes many non-traditional automakers -- are certainly hoping so. For the OEMs, a substantial secondary revenue stream other than sales would help bolster an industry that could best be described as "embattled" in the 21st century.</p><p>In order to gather and synthesize data that is meaningful and valuable to third parties, connected car manufacturers must first have significant technological infrastructure in place. <a href="https://www.fordpass.com/en_us/home.html" target="new">Ford Pass</a> and GM&apos;s <a href="https://www.onstar.com/us/en/services/navigation/AtYourService.html" target="new">OnStar AtYourService</a> are both platforms that legacy automakers use to improve the experience of their drivers (and sell their data). But if a single data platform were to be used across the industry, it would improve accessibility and make it much easier for data buyers to know exactly what they were getting.</p><p>Attempts to create just that are underway. Earlier this year, <a href="http://otonomo.io/" target="new">Otonomo</a> raised $25 million <a href="https://www.pehub.com/2017/04/otonomo-nabs-25-mln-series-b/" target="new">in a Series B round</a> of fundraising.

Self-driving cars can navigate to a destination without requiring a human behind the wheel -- pretty simple.</p><p>However, what if a car were autonomous in every sense of the word? What if it not only knew when it needed more gas, but drove itself to the gas station to refuel without being told? What if it recognized that it needed repairs and could perform the work itself? And what if a car could securely pay for all of these processes without any human interaction?</p><p>This type of autonomous car future is very much in play, according to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/consumer-industrial-products/Blockchain_AutomotiveFinance.pdf" target="new">a new report</a> from <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html" target="new">Deloitte Consulting</a> titled "Blockchain @ Auto Finance: How blockchain can enable the Future of Mobility." </p><p>For those that may be unfamiliar with the term -- or may have only heard it in relation to the cyber-currency Bitcoin -- the report defines blockchain as "a digital, chronologically updated, massively duplicated and cryptographically sealed record of data transfer activities within a network of participants." Essentially, blockchain is a method of digital record-keeping that is extremely secure because it is not stored centrally and each entry cannot be retroactively modified.</p><p>Thanks to the secure nature of transactions and the authenticity of the data, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity. That, of course, will include autonomous vehicles.</p><p>"What we are seeing today is that a lot of automotive companies, captives, and fleet management companies are experimenting with blockchain, but it&apos;s still at very early stages," Deloitte partner Sebastian Pfeifle, an author of the report, <a href="http://www.autofinancenews.net/where-the-blockchain-tipping-point-for-auto-finance-lies/" target="new">told Auto Finance News</a>.</p><p>But the possibilities blockchain presents for everyone in the connected car space -- manufacturers, sellers, owners and service providers -- are immense.</p><p>Deloitte presents several use cases for blockchain with regards to autonomous vehicles: identity management, payments, vehicle history, finance and operations. The report first addresses identity management, and the tension between an increased desire for data from fleet managers and an increased resistance to sharing data from users.</p><p>"Blockchain can intervene on both sides of the equation," says the report, before describing how blockchain will allow users to selectively and securely share data.</p><p>While the ability of a car to pay for its own servicing may sound like a futuristic luxury, the authors of the Deloitte report see it as more of a necessity. "Any automobile must be capable of managing the transactions that take place while consumers are using it, both to send and to receive funds," they write. The security that blockchain promises will make purchases made by automobiles more secure than current forms of electronic payment, and such an arrangement will also conveniently reduce the time drivers spend, say, paying for gas.</p><p>Other benefits described in the report include unimpeachably accurate records of car history -- think Carfax, but way better -- expanded loyalty programs and facilitated back-office operations. All look set to make an impact on the future of the automotive sector, and will likely lead to a greater and greater role for blockchain going forward that should benefit OEMs and drivers alike.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Connected Cars & the Future of Blockchain' --post_excerpt='Autonomous vehicles could be self-operating in more ways than driving thanks to blockchain technology' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Connected Cars & the Future of Blockchain' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-08-02 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-08-02 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,7,9" --tags_input='blockchain, Bitcoin, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, Deloitte, OEMs' --tax_input=''

"By applying an intelligent multi-story car park infrastructure and networking it with vehicles, we have managed to realize driverless parking substantially earlier than planned."</p><p>Throughout the development of the parking garage&apos;s connectivity, Bosch and Daimler worked extensively with various regulatory bodies, including the Stuttgart regional council, Germany&apos;s federal transport ministry and the T#UMLAUT#V Rheinland technical inspection authority. Now the facility is active, the coming months will see various testing and trials to make sure it is safe and functioning properly.

It&apos;s a good thing that the app is so popular since the more people that use Waze, the better the service that the app provides. Waze users take it upon themselves to report car accidents, traffic jams, police traps, construction zones and more.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>In late July, Tesla released the first batch of its much-anticipated Model 3 sedan, the latest electric vehicle offering from the innovative automaker and the one most expected to lead to mainstream adoption of electric vehicles.</p><p>The standard version of the Model 3 retails for $35,000, representing a considerable price drop from Tesla&apos;s previous models.</p><p>That price is supposed to make the Model 3 attractive to car buyers who might not have previously considered themselves in the market for an EV. But consumers quickly discovered that $35,000 does not buy a fully-loaded Tesla. As with other car manufacturers, Tesla offers a lot of options that drive up the final price.</p><p>Anyone wanting a color other than black or a longer-range battery or autopilot features has to pay significantly more than $35,000.</p><p>The cost of next-gen vehicles, whether they be electric, autonomous, or both, is one of the biggest hurdles for an industry looking to get over a hump. And it&apos;s not a hurdle that&apos;s going away anytime soon. In an interview with Axios, Alex Russell, CEO of Lidar development company <a href="https://www.luminartech.com/technology/index.html" target="new">Luminar</a>, noted that autonomous vehicles will fetch some awfully high prices when they&apos;re initially introduced to the consumer market.</p><p>"Most of the attention is on bringing down the price of Lidar to $1,000, or even $100, so that self-driving can be embraced by the mass market," according to the <a href="https://www.axios.com/fully-autonomous-cars-will-cost-hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars-2464972542.html" target="new">article</a>. </p><p>"Current top-of-the-line Lidar -- those boxes you see on top of test cars tooling around big cities -- cost $75,000 to $85,000. When the technology is optimized, the price will initially be $300,000 to $400,000 -- the price that fleet owners will be willing to pay because of how profitable ride-hailing will be as a business," Russell said.</p><p>Lidar is the laser technology that most autonomous vehicles use to detect their surroundings.</p><p>Using millions of lasers, Lidar sensors give autonomous vehicle software a blueprint to construct a three-dimensional map of the car&apos;s immediate environment, which it then uses to maneuver itself through traffic. The most recognizable form that Lidar takes is in the coffee can-shaped device on top of self-driving cars designed by <a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new">Waymo</a> and others.</p><p>While Russell appears to be the first to predict such a hefty price tag for consumer self-driving cars, he is far from the first to point out that the current state of Lidar technology needs to evolve considerably for autonomous vehicles to take the road. As of now, most experts consider the state of the tech to be insufficient to guide autonomous vehicles at highway speeds. Further, even the technology that <em>is</em> currently available would be prohibitively expensive to equip entire fleets at scale.</p><p>"Low-speed applications may be more affordable more quickly than higher-speed ones," <a href="https://www.oxbotica.ai/" target="new">Oxbotica</a> CEO Graeme Smith told the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608348/low-quality-lidar-will-keep-self-driving-cars-in-the-slow-lane/" target="new">MIT Technology Review</a>. "If you want a laser that&apos;s operating over 250 meters, you need a finely calibrated laser. If you&apos;re working in a lower-speed environment and can get by with 15 meters&apos; range, then you can afford [to use] a much lower-cost sensor."</p><p>At only 22, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40406052/this-sensor-technology-ceo-wants-to-be-in-self-driving-cars-by-his-26th-birthday" target="_blank">Russell is not a typical automotive CEO</a>. With $36 million in fundraising, Luminar has become a legit player and figures to be one of the companies, if not <em>the</em> company, that pushes Lidar technology where it needs to go. That, not cost, is his greatest concern.</p><p>"The biggest question is not cost, but who is going to get there first," he told Axios.</p><p>While that may be true, cost is certainly going to play an important role in helping self-driving cars reach a tipping point. And since most people don&apos;t have a quarter of a million bucks to drop on a new car, no matter how advanced its technology, the sector is going to have to find cheaper alternatives that don&apos;t compromise on quality or safety in order to succeed.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Luminar CEO: Fully Autonomous Cars Could Cost $400K' --post_excerpt='Luminar exec Alex Russell says LIDAR technology is holding back autonomous vehicles and helping to push up the sticker price.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Luminar CEO: Fully Autonomous Cars Could Cost $400K' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-08-08 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-08-08 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='Luminar, LIDAR, Alex Russell, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, Tesla, Model 3, MSRP' --tax_input=''

Shuttles owned by individual tech companies pick up employees throughout the greater San Francisco area, transporting them in comfortable buses equipped with WiFi so they can work on their way to, and from, the fabled tech campuses outside of the city center.</p><p>A study by the <a href="http://mtc.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2016%20Bay%20Area%20Shuttle%20Census.pdf" target="new">Bay Area Council and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission</a> determined that 800 tech buses transported 34,000 passengers to work every day. They&apos;ve been a commute-easing lifesaver for some, and also, at times, a source of controversy in a rapidly gentrifying city.</p><p>The buses are an extension of Silicon Valley&apos;s devotion to the idea of disruption. The innovation could be pushed even further as Silicon Valley&apos;s fascination with autonomous vehicles now extends to shuttles.</p><p>It was recently revealed that Bauer&apos;s Intelligent Transportation, a San Francisco shuttle company with clients such as Cisco and Intuit, is one of 36 companies to <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing" target="new">receive a California permit to test self-driving vehicles</a> on public streets.</p><p>The list includes big name automakers such as Ford and Honda, self-driving car leaders Waymo and Uber, and large tech companies, including Nvidia and Baidu.</p><p>Along with French company Navya, Bauer&apos;s appears to be one of only two companies on the list that works with shuttles. Unlike Navya, though, Bauer&apos;s has been entirely opaque about its intentions with autonomous vehicle technology. The <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Shuttle-bus-operator-Bauer-s-gets-self-driving-11656078.php" target="new">San Francisco Chronicle reports</a> that the company has not registered any test drivers or vehicles with the California DMV, both of which, in addition to the permit Bauer&apos;s already possesses, would be necessary to test a self-driving car or shuttle on public roads.</p><p>Bauer&apos;s wouldn&apos;t comment for the Chronicle story, adding another layer of mystery to their plans.</p><p>Of course, there are only so many possibilities of what Bauer&apos;s is developing, or, at least considering developing. It&apos;s hard to imagine another company with a client base that would be more enthralled by autonomous vehicle technology, and it&apos;s quite possible that Bauer&apos;s is in discussions to partner with one of those clients to try and get self-driving shuttles on the road. It&apos;s worth noting that many experts consider the navigation of urban environments to be a higher challenge for autonomous vehicles, and such driving represents a significant portion of a tech bus&apos;s operations. Bauer&apos;s also offers private car and limousine services.</p><p>Meanwhile, the implementation of self-driving shuttles is already happening elsewhere. Beginning this fall, the University of Michigan&apos;s engineering students, faculty and staff <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">will use an autonomous shuttle</a> built by the aforementioned <a href="http://navya.tech/" target="new">Navya</a> on public roads in Ann Arbor. Another French startup, <a href="http://easymile.com/" target="new">EasyMile</a>, also<a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">plans to operate a self-driving shuttle</a> beginning in August in a California business park.</p><p>The curious thing about Bauer&apos;s is that, while all signs point to them not currently having any substantive self-driving technology, it is unlikely that they would be able obtain a permit to test autonomous vehicles on public roads without it. The most likely scenario would be a partnership with a tech company that <em>does</em> have this kind of technology. It will be interesting to monitor this mystery as new clues emerge.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Tech Shuttle Firm Bauer&apos;s Receives Self-Driving Permit' --post_excerpt='Bauer&apos;s is being coy about its intentions towards autonomous vehicles.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Tech Shuttle Firm Bauer&apos;s Receives Self-Driving Permit' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-08-09 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-08-09 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,6,7,8,9" --tags_input='Bauer&apos;s, shuttle, Silicon Valley, automated vehicles, self-driving cars, Waymo, Uber' --tax_input=''

The stakes figure to be even higher once self-driving cars are on the road in large numbers, as the prospect of someone hijacking and controlling an autonomous vehicle remotely is utterly terrifying.</p><p>These risks have moved beyond theoretical.

Last year, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/oh-good-new-hack-can-unlock-100-million-volkswagens/" target="new">Volkswagen came under fire</a> for a similar situation.

Alongside other hyper-relevant topics like voting machine security, it&apos;s fitting that the Car Hacking Village was one of the most talked about showcases at DEF CON. Presentations at the Village had titles such as "Insecure by Law," "Grand Theft Radio," and "That&apos;s no car. It&apos;s a network!"</p><p>The rise of an event like the Car Hacking Village is a direct result of an increased need for cybersecurity experts in the connected vehicle space. In a matter of years, car manufacturers have gone from being relatively unconcerned with computer technology to relying upon it entirely. As computerized cars become fully connected cars, workers with cybersecurity backgrounds are at a premium for these automakers. In fact, the demand is so great that it is outstripping supply.</p><P>Active outreach in the form of events like the Village has become a key tool in helping companies fill essential cybersecurity positions.</p><p>"Hacking cars is hard," Casey Ellis, founder of Car Hacking Village sponsor <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/" target="_blank">Bugcrowd</a>, told <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/344539-demand-of-automotive-cyberseuriy-pros-outpaces-supply" target="new">The Hill</a>. "It requires specialized equipment and knowledge, not to mention the car. That&apos;s part of the reason [manufacturers] jumped into this. It&apos;s a good way to access talent they would otherwise be unable to hire."</p><p>"We need to move researchers to automobiles," Tod Beardsley told The Hill. Beardsley is director of research of software security company Rapid7, a sponsor of the Village.</p><p>The in-demand skill set is a specific one. The process that cybersecurity experts use to find weaknesses in automotive programs is somewhat counter-intuitive: They try to hack it themselves. By attempting to infiltrate a technology, coders can identify weak points, which is essential knowledge for understanding how to best shore them up. Plus, it gives security specialists insight into the mindset of the hackers they&apos;re trying to thwart.</p><p>In order to adequately address these issues, the automotive sector needs to undertake a sustained effort to recruit cybersecurity experts over the next several years. Sponsoring events like the Car Hacking Village is a start, but even more will need to be done in the future to grow the talent pool. The future of connected vehicles depends on it.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Autonomous Cybersecurity Job Market Heating Up' --post_excerpt='At the Car Hacking Village at DEF CON this year, the need for automotive cybersecurity experts was apparent.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Autonomous Cybersecurity Job Market Heating Up' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-08-10 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-08-10 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,5,6,8" --tags_input='cybersecurity, Car Hacking Village, DEF CON, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, connected cars' --tax_input=''

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>If you were driving around California or Michigan, and you passed what you suspected is a self-driving car, the first thing that might tip you off would be a spinning, semi-conical device atop the car. Known as Lidar (light detection and ranging), this sensor technology serves as the primary way that autonomous vehicles "see" their surroundings.</p><p>Every second, Lidar sensors send out millions of laser pulses that bounce off nearby objects, allowing a self-driving car&apos;s software to build a constantly refreshing three-dimensional map of its environment. Camera sensors then help an autonomous vehicle interpret the objects that the Lidar is gauging, and the vehicle navigates itself accordingly.</p><p>But while many consider Lidar to be the key to ultimately making self-driving cars a reality, it is also one of the biggest barriers. The reasons are twofold and interconnected. First, Lidar technology isn&apos;t good enough yet to sufficiently guide fully autonomous vehicles. Second, Lidar technology isn&apos;t cheap enough yet.</p><p>The challenge presented by the former compounds the difficulty of the latter.</p><p>A car traveling at highway speeds approaches upcoming objects at a faster rate than a car traveling at 25mph. To safely travel at speeds of 65mph or faster, a car would need to be equipped with high-powered Lidar that extends its lasers to great distances, giving the autonomous driving system a sufficient amount of time to process the information and react.</p>{image 1}<p>"Low-speed applications may be more affordable more quickly than higher-speed ones," <a href="https://www.oxbotica.ai/" target="_blank">Oxbotica</a> CEO Graeme Smith told <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608348/low-quality-lidar-will-keep-self-driving-cars-in-the-slow-lane/" target="new">MIT Technology Review</a>. "If you want a laser that&apos;s operating over 250 meters, you need a finely calibrated laser. If you&apos;re working in a lower-speed environment and can get by with 15 meters&apos; range, then you can afford [to use] a much lower-cost sensor."</p><p>Of course, no viable autonomous vehicle will only navigate at school zone-level speeds. And cost remains a limiting factor even in the low-end tech. Lidar manufacturer <a href="http://velodynelidar.com/products.html" target="new">Velodyne</a> sells its least powerful sensor for $8,000, a figure that would be prohibitively expensive for mass production of autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Progress, however, is being made both with regards to Lidar capabilities and price points.</p><p>Velodyne touts its forthcoming <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170419005516/en/Velodyne-LiDAR-Announces-%E2%80%9CVelarray%E2%80%9D-LiDAR-Sensor" target="new">Velarray</a> sensor as ensuring "safe operation in L4 and L5 autonomous vehicles" at "a target price in the hundreds of dollars when produced in mass volumes." <a href="http://quanergy.com/" target="new">Quanergy</a>, one of Velodyne&apos;s competitors, announced that it would begin production <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170314/MOBILITY/170319926/quanergys-%24250-lidar-to-be-produced-later-this-year" target="new">on a $250 Lidar system</a> later this year.</p><p>Lidar is not the be-all and end-all for autonomous vehicles.

The company also makes cellphones beyond the iPhone, including products for BlackBerry and Nokia, as well as Amazon&apos;s Kindle e-reader and Dell PCs.</p><p>All told, Foxconn is the world&apos;s largest manufacturer of consumer electronics.</p><p>However, as recent news clearly illustrates, <a href="http://www.foxconn.com/" target="newk">Foxconn</a> has its sights set on electronics that extend far beyond those that can fit in a user&apos;s hands. <a href="http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2105577/foxconn-gives-trumps-jobs-vow-shot-arm-multibillion-dollar" target="new">The South China Morning Post</a> reports that the Taiwanese company plans to make a multibillion dollar investment into the development of autonomous vehicle technology in Michigan. The exact amount of the investment remains to be determined. It&apos;s also not clear what the money will be used for, but the most likely answer is a research and development facility in some shape or form.</p><p>"Automotive development in the US is still more advanced than China," Foxconn founder Terry Gou told the Post. "Besides self-driving technology, I&apos;m also interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning technology."</p><p>Gou&apos;s vague allusions to AI and deep learning tech suggests that the media isn&apos;t the only one in the dark about Foxconn&apos;s intentions in Michigan. The company itself may not have a clear idea of exactly what it plans to do. The announcement of the Michigan initiative came mere days after Foxconn made huge waves elsewhere in the Midwest, with the announcement of a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin to manufacture LCD crystals.</p><p>That project, however, is already ensconced in controversy after studies showed that the $3 billion in incentives needed to lure Foxconn to Wisconsin <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/08/wisconsin-taxpayer-payments-foxconn-could-top-300-million-year-2022/546508001/" target="new">would take at least 25 years for taxpayers to break even on</a>.</p><p>Those economic concerns have given the state legislature some pause in approving the plant and the its requisite incentives, although Gov. Scott Walker maintains that the deal will get done. Between the indeterminate nature of the Michigan facility and the fact that it would require similarly substantial investment by taxpayers, it may still be too early to call Foxconn&apos;s Michigan plans a done deal.</p><p>If the manufacturer does come to Michigan, though, it will enter one of the most autonomous vehicle-friendly states in the US. In December 2016, Gov. Rick Snyder signed into law a bill that makes the state more permissive to the testing of self-driving cars on its roads than nearly all other states.

Individuals would be able to work, eat, read or just relax with a movie in their car as the vehicle drives itself.</p><p>On a wider scale, we see that the world will be changed when, as many analysts predict, traffic deaths are reduced by 90% thanks to the ability of cars to speak to one another. We marvel at, and enthusiastically use, the autonomous functions on our current vehicles like self-parking and single-lane highway autopilot. It&apos;s important to remember, however, that most American consumers are not so psyched.</p><p> Yet... </p><p>An overwhelming number of consumers -- 74% -- believe that self-driving cars are "not safe," and will remain so into the foreseeable future, according to <a href="https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/deloitte-review/issue-20/winning-consumer-trust-future-of-automotive-technology.html" target="new">a study published by Deloitte</a> early this year.

Only 43% of drivers were interested in "limited self-drive" features, which would include offerings like parking assist, the study found. </p><p>The reasons for this lukewarm attitude towards vehicles with autonomous features? A lack of education on the part of OEMs and other autonomous vehicle advocates is resulting in a lack of awareness on the part of consumers.</p><p>Speaking at the Center for Automotive Research <a href="http://www.cargroup.org/mbs/" target="new">Management Briefing Seminars</a> in Traverse City, Mich., Kay Stepper, vice president of automated driving for Bosch, spoke about the imperative of showing drivers how to use the self-driving technology that already populates many automobiles and is set to be equipped on many more in the future. A significant hurdle to consumer acceptance lies in the worries that come with fully trusting a machine at high speeds, Stepper said.</p><p>"One of the concerns certainly that&apos;s out there still is lack of control, and basically trusting the machine to take over the driving task," Stepper <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170731/OEM06/170739907/bosch-explaining-autonomous-to-consumers-will-be-critical" target="new">told Automotive News</a>. "What happens if an unforeseen situation comes across that the machine was not trained for?"</p><p>Those concerns are understandable, and that&apos;s why education is so necessary. Bosch hosts events to teach consumers about its offerings, and even has an online platform known as the <a href="http://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.us/us/highlights/automated-mobility/amc/" target="new">Bosch Automated Mobility Academy</a>. And while those are excellent supplementary tools, Stepper understands that the most effective teaching incorporates hands-on learning.</p><p>"To experience what it&apos;s like when it actually happens, that is a completely different matter," Stepper said of backup autonomous systems that can protect self-driving cars. "It&apos;s an important aspect to showcase and bring to consumers and the general public."</p><p>Stepper noted that with the current model of car sales, OEMs are simply unable to provide adequate direct-to-consumer teaching.</p><p>"It comes down to education in the dealership, that&apos;s where a lot of the conversation happens," he said.</p><p>Of course, that necessitates a different kind of teaching for Bosch and other manufacturers of AV technology. They need to train car dealers to be able to adequately convey the value of this tech to their buyers.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>The story of industry in the US is one of collaboration, cooperation and goodwill among competing companies. Enterprises have balked at the idea of relentlessly pursuing patents, instead opting to fully share revelatory discoveries with other players in their industries.</p><p>Rather than pursuing monopolization through vertical or horizontal integration, businesses have made conscious efforts to allow room for a large number of companies to operate.</p><p>Alright, so we&apos;re being a little facetious.</p><p>Clearly, competition -- not cooperation -- has been the driving force in the history of American industry. Few businesspeople would have it any other way.</p><p>However, as the young self-driving car sector begins to mature, some are concerned that the race to patent every single relevant technology will leave each company with, yes, their own exclusive tech, but also a few missing pieces of the puzzle when it comes to designing a fully autonomous vehicle. This dynamic hasn&apos;t been much of a concern with technologies such as high-definition televisions or smartwatches. But since experts predict that many lives will be saved when our roads are full of self-driving cars, the stunted development of the technology amounts to the maintenance of a deadly status quo.</p><p>Thus far, the highest-profile example of a patent lawsuit in the autonomous vehicle space <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/4/6/15194322/waymo-uber-lawsuit-self-driving-lidar-anthony-levandowski-injunction" target="new">is the one between</a> Alphabet&apos;s <a href="https://waymo.com/" target="_blank">Waymo</a> and <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/pittsburgh/self-driving-ubers/" target="new">Uber</a>.</p><p>The case involves Anthony Levandowski, who worked at Waymo -- then simply known as Google&apos;s self-driving car division -- until January 2016, when he left to launch self-driving truck startup Otto. Otto has since been acquired by Uber, and Levandowski is a key leader in the company&apos;s autonomous vehicle efforts. But Waymo called foul: His ex-employer claims that Levandowski illegally stole 14,000 confidential files on his way out the door and has since used them to develop technology at Otto and Uber.</p><p>"This would essentially be a warning to others thinking about using Google-based technology: &apos;Use it and we will crush you in court too,&apos;" NYU Law professor Jeanne Fromer <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/news/a27480/patent-wars-self-driving-car/" target="new">told Popular Mechanics</a>. "The implication, in this case, is that everybody will be blocked from building the best version of the product being developed unless all participants play well together, thus stifling innovation."</p><p>To a certain degree, the market mechanisms that would bring about such "stifling" are natural, inevitable and good. A company that is the first to successfully design technology for a new product deserves to profit from its innovation. To eliminate the possibility of patenting one&apos;s own technology would clearly disincentivize innovation.

If things get too granular, autonomous vehicle developers could be hamstrung if essential self-driving car parts are each patented by different owners.</p><p>Fortunately, the amount of collaboration already present in the autonomous vehicle space indicates that companies realize the self-driving car is a problem that no individual company can tackle alone.

wp post create --post_author='Marques McCammon' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Every major auto maker is racing to capitalize on the autonomous car market&apos;s enormous potential. They&apos;re staffing up, acquiring new companies and capabilities and innovating at an unprecedented pace. They know they can&apos;t afford to be left behind.</p> <p>However, this competitive free-for-all could have huge downsides: redundant and wasteful investments, fragmented critical safety standards, and simply unsustainable business models.</p><p><b>Examining the current model</b><br/>Software is at the core of autonomous vehicles. The functionality, experience, and dynamics -- from dashboard instruments to the powertrain to safety systems to in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) -- are all defined by software. Simply put, autonomous car OEMs are now in the software business, competing on software innovation and cycle times. They all want to be the smartest and fastest with each new innovation.</p><p>The problem is that auto makers are creating their own software models in isolation. As such, each and every software element must be individually secured, made safe and compliant, then translated into a production-ready commercial product. In this one-off fashion, every company in the value chain ends up investing more money, hiring more people and incurring longer delays than necessary.</p> <p>These inefficiencies would then be passed on to consumers, translating to excessively high prices and possibly slower adoptions rates for autonomous cars, which in turn diminishes the market opportunity for OEMs, Tier 1s and service providers.</p><p>Equally troubling, autonomous car software complexity makes it all the more challenging for auto makers to maintain scalability as it moves from the drawing board into production. Most auto makers are relatively inexperienced in software-based business models and will have difficulty keeping pace with the accelerating rate of change. Scaling up and into production will be a daunting challenge without core software elements standardization.</p><p><b>Cooperate on standards and compete on delivery</b><br/>It&apos;s clear that a more efficient model for creating and deploying autonomous vehicle software is in need. By looking to other industries with mission-critical software components, such as aerospace and defense, players in the autonomous car market can learn from these past successes. These other mission-critical industries have taken an open standards software approach that includes two basic tenets:</p><ul><li>Core mission-critical elements of the software stack should be a given. They should be based on open standards that are accessible to all -- so that innovation can focus on adding value.</li><li>Competitive differentiation should derive from innovation around the open software standard and the development of commercial products based on the standard.</li></ul><p>Let&apos;s look to other mission-critical industries for similar examples. Rather than create a proprietary software framework, a major avionics player created a common core system (CCS) based on the ARINC 653 specification, which enabled a diverse ecosystem of suppliers to deliver software that executed on this common platform.</p><p>ARINC standards, which relate to elements such as avionics, cabin systems, protocols and interfaces, are used by thousands of commercial aircrafts. ARINC industry activities collaboratively establish industry-wide, consensus-based, voluntary technical aviation standards. The new CCS platform then led to the creation of RTCA DO-297, a new standard that defined business roles -- platform suppliers, applications suppliers and systems integrators -- as well as processes and workflow for those roles. This role-based business methodology evolved into the current, global standard for all large commercial aircraft development today. Ultimately, an entire industry came together and their cooperative approach to standards accelerated and optimized innovation and efficiencies.</p> <p>It&apos;s important to note that open standards are not the same as open source. Open standards are guidelines that are publicly available and democratically controlled by a community. Open source is the software code itself that&apos;s freely available, subject to the terms of a licensing agreement. Whether or not the software is open source is not the issue here. The core issue is the urgent need for industry-wide agreement on a set of open standards.</p><p>This smarter, more cooperative approach to open standards, particularly for mission-critical infrastructure elements such as operating systems and safety-related software, will accelerate opportunities in the autonomous car market. Open standards will drive innovation, lower costs, prevent software code volume inflation, ensure scalability, reduce safety risks and make production practical.</p><p><b>Next steps on the road to open software standards</b><br/>To best move the autonomous car market forward, we need industry leaders to drive the discussion around open software standards, engage all market players, and organize a standards body that can help determine:</p><ul><li>Which standards are needed</li><li>How open standards will be defined, created, and regulated</li><li>Which elements of intellectual property (IP) need to be standardized</li><li>Which open standards have the highest potential for generating innovation</li><li>Which open standards create the highest potential for risk, and how best to mitigate that risk</li></ul><p>By defining and adhering to autonomous open standards, the auto industry can bridge the gap between the need for cost-efficient commercial differentiation and the imperative to protect consumers in an age of accelerating innovation. The time for a smarter and more collaborative approach is now.</p>-- Marques McCammon is the general manager of Connected Vehicle Solutions at Wind River</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Urgent Imperative for the Autonomous Car Market: Open Standards' --post_excerpt='Software is now a key element in the autonomous car market.

We&apos;re not really saying from a product point of view, but we are being straightforward in saying that it&apos;s a core technology that we see as important."</p><p>Headlines declared it as confirmation that Apple was working on self-driving cars, which, explicitly, it was not. But given how opaque Cook and his teams can be with their plans for designing new products, his words were treated like a valuable nugget of insight.</p><p>In early August, in a phone call with investors, Cook made more news by speaking on the subject again.</p><p>"[Autonomous] systems can be used in a variety of ways," <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/1/16079902/apple-autonomous-systems-going-beyond-cars" target="new">he said</a>.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>In July, the House Energy & Commerce Committee unanimously approved the Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research in Vehicle Evolution Act. (That&apos;s the SELF DRIVE Act for short.) Thanks to its committee approval, the legislation will appear in front of the wider House in September.</p><p>The main purpose of the bill is to get more self-driving cars on the road. It proposes expanding the number of annual exemptions that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issues to allow "unapproved" (i.e. autonomous) vehicles on the road from 2,500 to 100,000. It also seeks to establish councils dedicated to making sure AV technology is used to actively improve the transportation capabilities of the elderly and the disabled.</p><p>As the bipartisan approval of the bill thus far suggests, criticism has been minimal.</p><p>Early on in the process, though, some raised concerns that such a massive expansion of self-driving cars on the road could create safety issues. For US Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MICH), however, safety was the one reason she backed the bill. "The development of automated vehicles has the potential to significantly reduce traffic fatalities in the United States," reads <a href="https://debbiedingell.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/dingell-backed-self-driving-car-legislation-advances-house-subcommittee" target="new">a statement from her office</a> regarding the legislation.</p><p>The development of autonomous vehicles -- and connected cars at large -- prompts questions about another form of safety, too: that of cybersecurity. For years, automakers haven&apos;t had to worry about cybersecurity because a lack of Internet connectivity on vehicular computer systems made it a non-issue.</p><p>However, as the connected car revolution takes place, OEMs are hard at work recruiting cybersecurity experts to make their systems unimpeachable.</p><p>Lawmakers also want to hold them accountable.</p><p>While the House considers the legislation approved by the committee, the US Senate has seen a bipartisan group of its members introduce <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-congress-idUSKBN1AH474" target="new">legislation concerning Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity</a>. Like the House bill that would open the roads to more self-driving cars, the Senate legislation is conspicuously bipartisan: It is sponsored by Mark Warner (D-VA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Steve Daines (R-MT) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).</p><p>"Information is a form of currency," <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases" target="new">Daines wrote in a statement</a>. "We need to have proper safeguards in place to ensure that our information is protected while still encouraging innovation."</p><p>The senators behind the bill worked in conjunction with institutions such as the Atlantic Council and Harvard University&apos;s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society to gain expertise and perspective on the type of measures necessary to make IoT technology consistently safe in the US. While the connectivity of IoT tech is its defining and most appealing feature, it is also its greatest weakness. The new bill proposes that vendors make IoT devices patchable, free of unchangeable passwords and known security vulnerabilities. Essentially, it appears to be a codification of best practices.</p><p>"This legislation would establish thorough, yet flexible, guidelines for Federal Government procurements of connected devices," Warner wrote. "My hope is that this legislation will remedy the obvious market failure that has occurred and encourage device manufacturers to compete on the security of their products."</p><p>Unlike the autonomous vehicle legislation currently working its way through the House, the Senate&apos;s IoT bill looks to tighten existing regulations rather than loosen them. Connected car enthusiasts, however, should be excited about both: Legislators are actively seeking to set up automakers to succeed, something that is both good in and of itself, and a sign of favorable legislative practices to come in the future.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='US Senate&apos;s IoT Security Bill: What It Means for Connected Cars' --post_excerpt='A proposed IoT security bill in the US Senate could affect connected cars.

Customers want to invest in relationships that will bring them the benefits of efficiency and convenience -- and the automotive industry is starting to respond to this growing demand.</p><p>In addition to refining and advancing in-vehicle technologies, connected car makers are looking beyond the driver experience from within the car, and are developing new capabilities that enable data to connect and interact with third parties outside the vehicle.</p><p>Before these capabilities can be successfully implemented, automotive manufacturers need to provide supportive infrastructure: real-time, cloud-based, secure, connected services.</p><p> Leveraging cloud services will substantially increase the number of use cases that connected vehicles can support, as cloud platforms will not only work within the car but will connect to a wide range of outside data sources. Services will become advanced and personalized, including smart transport solutions and monitoring capabilities that memorize your driving style and preferences.</p><p> Drivers and passengers of connected vehicles will also have access to several value-added services, such as shopping and media content streaming, directly from the vehicle. <p>Imagine this: You rent a car at the airport and when you pick it up, your unique driver profile is instantly downloaded so the vehicle is set up according to your specific preferences. Your music and podcast playlists from your smartphone are readily available and synced to the sound system. When you input your destination, the navigation system analyzes real-time traffic light data to factor in the frequency of when the lights will turn yellow or red, optimizing the fastest route possible and minimizing time wasted in traffic.</p><p>With highly sophisticated and personalized connectivity capabilities comes new security challenges that should be addressed preemptively.</p><p>Instead of solely protecting the hardware that lives inside the vehicle, there is a growing need for security to cover the entire ecosystem from the vehicle to the cloud and any third-party providing data feeds. Implementing identity management in a vehicle can enable it to understand who and what it can exchange data with.</p><p>For example, the car will know that it can talk to a given cloud server and which APIs can be interacted with and what data they can share.</p><p> The vehicle will also understand other key elements such as the normal pattern of behavior, including the time of day and frequency of interactions, as well as the type of data exchanged. It will also be able to detect abnormal behavioral patterns. This comprehensive set of capabilities creates a trust, verify-based approach.</p><p>Additionally, as the market for automotive services continues to expand, identity management will be important for enabling new, consumer orientated, and vehicle-to-"thing" relationships to develop.  For instance, in a trust-based relationship between the connected car and the smart home, your car would be able to send instructions to your home to turn off lights, activate your alarm system, turn on your air conditioner, and so on. </p><p>The relationship would function both ways, allowing your home to send alerts to your car. Your smart refrigerator would be able to check your food inventory and let you know if you needed to pick up milk on your drive home.</p>  <p>The best time to add identity management to vehicles is at the point of manufacture on the production line, as the manufacturer will be able to fully verify the installation. This will also allow vehicles to be pre-configured for secure relations with OEMs and cloud services, and can be fully integrated with other security mechanisms within the vehicle.</p><p>-- Andrew Till is the vice president of Technology, Partnerships & New Solutions at Harman Connected Services</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Trust-Based Service: Advancing Connectivity in the Auto Industry' --post_excerpt='As more of our &apos;things&apos; are connected, consumers are starting to expect the type of conveniences that they only dreamed of years ago.

A collaborative project with the Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia, called "Motion and Muscle Activation of Young Volunteers in Evasive Vehicle Maneuvers," will test how child occupants react to emergency responses by self-driving cars.

Combined with location services, the spontaneous nature of on-the-road dining offers restaurants a compelling opportunity to attract new customers. For drivers within a certain radius, a restaurant could offer an appealing coupon or a bargain deal applicable to that exact time of day, displayed on those drivers&apos; cars&apos; navigation systems. Of course, such a possibility isn&apos;t limited to food vendors; providers of all sorts of goods and services could bring in new business this way.</p><ul><li><strong>On target</strong></li></ul><p>We&apos;ve all experienced the disconcerting sensation of browsing for products online and, immediately afterward, having advertisements for those same products follow you to every corner of the Internet. Web advertising often serves as an example of targeted ads gone wrong, obscuring the fact that targeted advertising is, in theory, a good thing for everyone. If you must hear or see commercials, why waste your time hearing about products or services that have nothing to do with you? Fortunately, the experience of hearing relevant ads through a streaming music service or, in the future, watching relevant ads on video streaming services in a self-driving car is as natural as the way we consume radio and television ads now, except better.</p><ul><li><strong>At your convenience</strong></li></ul><p>When autonomous vehicles become a common part of everyday life, a vast number of hours will be cleared for commuters and other drivers-turned-passengers to do whatever they please -- within the confines of a car, of course.

But when connected cars hit the road, we also need an airbag for our network. These safety precautions must be taken as seriously as the life-changing impacts of collisions. If left unaddressed, cybersecurity threats have the potential to jeopardize the transformative future of these innovations.</p><p>Appropriate security protections are essential to maximizing the benefits of connected cars, and keeping drivers and passengers safe. Every connected vehicle is tied into a network with a wealth of valuable and private information.  And we&apos;re doing our part to help protect it.</p><p>Here are the things every connected car manufacturer and stakeholder should keep in mind:</p><p>Telecom companies and car manufacturers need to collaborate now more than ever.As connected car functionality becomes more network connected, and as software updates and downloads become more prevalent on network connectivity, the interdependence of these two platforms will only increase.</p><p>As the relationship grows, so should the collaboration between the telecom companies and car manufacturers. This is necessary to deliver greater platform-to-platform security, improved end-to-end security, and most importantly, increased safety for the vehicle&apos;s occupants and their surrounding environment.</p><p>There are four major risk types against the vehicle and it&apos;s important to be prepared for each. The <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/" target="new">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) has identified direct cyber threats to four types of data or control:</p><ul><li>Privacy and security</li><li>Unwanted or unauthorized commercial transactions</li><li>Non-safety operational interference</li><li>Safety-related operational interference</li></ul><p>These multiple risk points call for end-to-end security between the vehicle and telecommunications platforms. This requires highly secure communication paths outside of the vehicle, as well as the environment that makes up the internal vehicle platform. Providing end-to-end security includes:</P><ul><li>End-to-end security outside the vehicle: Connecting the car as it communicates with the cloud, with specific servers or with individuals.</li><li>End-to-end security inside the vehicle: Between car manufacturers and their suppliers -- including software and hardware suppliers -- along the critical data and communication paths within the vehicle.</li></ul><p>In addition to cyberattacks directed against the vehicle, it&apos;s also possible for attacks to be directed against the cloud- based platforms that offer connected vehicle services. If these services are compromised, the attacker could exploit vehicle fleet interfaces as well as external-facing commercial and business interfaces to partner organizations.</p> <p>These services are likely to be attractive targets since they could contain financial data on users, and could ultimately lead to widespread infection.</p> <p>Telecom companies&apos; role in network security. With that in mind, carriers have an important role to play in helping to secure connectivity to/from cloud services, remote servers and individuals.</p>  <p>Network security should be a core competency for telecommunications network providers. Security features must be designed into the fabric of the communications infrastructure in order to offer highly secure connections to the end-user device.</p><p>An effective cybersecurity strategy must recognize the many possible communications paths to the connected vehicle, thus telecom carriers need an effective, layered approach. Further, as carriers work with vehicle manufacturers to deliver more secure vehicle strategies, a comprehensive end-to-end security framework can assist in seeing to it that all the links and parts of each path are highly secure.</p><p>To learn more about current initiatives in cybersecurity and how telecommunications companies and OEMs can work together, download the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions&apos; (ATIS) <a href="http://www.atis.org/connected-cars/" target="new">whitepaper</a>.</p><p>-- Katie Curtin is the director of Product Marketing Management for IoT Security at AT&T, and Senthil Ramakrishnan is the lead member of the Technical Staff for IoT at AT&T.' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Connected Car Security: What&apos;s at Stake' --post_excerpt='One of the biggest concerns in the connected car market is security.

It&apos;s one thing if your podcasts app malfunctions, but it&apos;s significantly more consequential if an app gets you lost in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>While Apple Maps has greatly improved since then, its existence has largely been defined by the game of catch-up it perpetually plays with <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/" target="new">Google</a> Maps.</p><p>If recent job postings are any indication, Apple is beginning to play that game with significantly more intention of winning.

A Software Engineer for Routing "will develop cutting-edge routing algorithms to constantly improve the routing experience and help millions of people every day with their driving, walking and public transit."</p><p>As several outlets have speculated, Apple will likely use these prospective hires to work on two key technologies, in addition to its existing Maps products: augmented reality and autonomous systems.</p><p>Augmented reality overlays digital images on the real-world environment as seen through a screen.

Then, they must completely overhaul operations and train employees to do new functions entirely. And at the end of it all, there&apos;s no guarantee of success -- many companies fold midway through such a transformation. It&apos;s such a harrowing idea to some enterprises that they shut down without even attempting a pivot.</p><p>Of course, some brave companies do succeed.</p><p>Such is the case of Delphi Automotive.</p><p>Historically, the company was known for manufacturing car components for electric and electronic architecture, electronics and safety and powertrain systems. In May, though, the company announced that it would be spinning off its powertrain division -- which represented a more traditional sector of the automotive industry --  and focusing the remaining elements of the company on electrical architecture for cars.</p><p>"[Automakers] are requiring a significant ramp up in computing power... and more and faster signals and data distribution in the car," CEO and President <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/05/04/self-driving-car-supplier-delphi-spins-off-division/101258690/" target="new">Kevin Clark said</a> at the time. "And we are the only supplier in the industry that has both the electrical architecture that controls computing power, controls signal distribution and the software capability to develop the systems for autonomous driving."</p><p>While such a bold move would normally take a long time to yield positive results, the status of the connected car space is so well-regarded that Delphi shares soared over 10% on the day of the announcement.</p><p>Since then, the news has only gotten better for Delphi and its shareholders: <a href="https://www.delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-reports-second-quarter-2017-financial-results" target="new">Revenue was up 5% during the second quarter of 2017</a>.</p><p>"Delphi delivered another strong quarter driven by our portfolio of relevant technologies," Clark wrote in a statement. "Based on our strong first half performance, we are raising our sales and earnings outlook for the year. We continue to execute as planned on the announced spin-off of our Powertrain segment and remain committed to providing value to our customers and creating value for our shareholders."</p><p>By now, though, no one is surprised to see Delphi surging, considering the series of high-profile partnerships it has established in the connected car sector. (The partnerships also seem to validate Clark&apos;s assertion about Delphi&apos;s uniqueness; clearly it offers something that many other companies want a part of.)</p><p>For over a year, Delphi has been publicly <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/delphis-self-driving-car-is-audi-this-world/" target="new">collaborating with Audi</a> on autonomous vehicle systems.

It can be a dangerous physical hazard. </p><p>A paper recently published by Yoshi Kohno and fellow researchers at the University of Washington entitled "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08945" target="new">Robust Physical-World Attacks on Machine Learning Models</a>" confirmed that autonomous vehicle systems are likely to be confused by street signs that have been altered in appearance.</p><P>This isn&apos;t entirely surprising since autonomous vehicles use logic to operate and alterations to a street sign could confuse that logic. More shocking, however, was the precise nature of these alterations and their consequences: By doctoring street signs to intentionally manipulate an autonomous vehicle&apos;s algorithms, Kohno and his team were able to cause self-driving cars to behave inappropriately and dangerously.</p><p>"We physically realized and evaluated two attacks," according to the report. "One that causes a stop sign to be misclassified as a speed limit sign in 100% of the testing conditions, and one that causes a right turn sign to be misclassified as either a stop or added lane sign in 100% of the testing conditions."</p><p>In each attack, stickers designed to confuse the automobiles in a specific way were affixed to street signs. In the former, the test cars consistently identified stop signs as 45mph speed limit signs, causing them to accelerate through the intersections on a test track. In the second experiment, vehicles would go straight in an instance where they were supposed to go right.</p><p>"We hypothesize that given the similar appearance of warning signs, small perturbations are sufficient to confuse the classifier," reads the report. "In future work, we plan to explore this hypothesis with targeted classification attacks on other warning signs."</p><p>The implications of Kohno&apos;s team&apos;s discoveries are obvious, and scary. Someone with access to or deep knowledge of an autonomous vehicle system -- and an equally deep supply of malicious intent -- could set up passengers in self-driving cars for some incredibly dangerous situations. Presumably, a self-driving car&apos;s safety systems would lessen the potential danger of such a "hack" by causing the car to stop or swerve to avoid danger in the aftermath. However, there&apos;s probably only so much these systems could do to avoid a T-bone in an intersection when multiple vehicles are converging on one another at high speeds.</p><p>Hiring cybersecurity experts has become a top priority for OEMs in the autonomous vehicle space, as the devastating outcomes that could result from any sort of hack have certainly kept more than a few engineers awake at night. Rather than shy away from the thought, though, researchers like Kohno have leaned into the darkest possibilities of our autonomous vehicle future. Every time they do, though, those possibilities become less and less likely of becoming a reality.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Street Sign Graffiti Could Confuse Autonomous Vehicles' --post_excerpt='Attacks on self-driving cars could come in the form of intentionally manipulated street signs.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Street Sign Graffiti Could Confuse Autonomous Vehicles' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-08-22 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-08-22 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,5,6,7,8,9" --tags_input='cybersecurity, hacks, autonomous vehicles, connected cars, self-driving cars' --tax_input=''

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>As with any emerging business sector, the self-driving car space has inspired plenty of questions about which companies will be the industry leaders when the dust settles (somewhat).</p><p>Currently, the industry is still young and almost every single company with even a tangential automotive connection finds itself competing in some form. This mass participation has fostered a sort of parlor game with participants obsessing over who will be the "winners" when it comes to producing autonomous vehicles and their various components.</p><p>For some, this is cause for optimism. <a href="http://nutonomy.com/" target="new">nuTonomy</a> CEO Karl Iagnemma believes that multiple winners will emerge across different regions of the world.</p><P>"There&apos;s this whole notion of a race and a race usually implies one winner," Iagnemma <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">has said</a>. "I don&apos;t believe there will be a single winner in this space. It&apos;s such a huge market.

"There&apos;s no way to actually assess the capabilities of the companies. People are doing it by marketing, employment numbers and how many vehicles they have on the road -- which are not very good metrics."</p><p>These ideas aren&apos;t necessarily inconsistent with one another. In fact, it&apos;s quite likely that both are accurate, and their synthesis yields a simple truism: Many companies will succeed in designing elements of the self-driving car of tomorrow, and many will not. Realizing this, automakers, software designers, parts suppliers and others have opted to collaborate with one another instead of trying to go it alone.</p><p>Further cementing this logic of collaboration is a climate in which regulators worldwide are seeking to make sure connected cars and autonomous vehicles are produced safely and resistant to hacking. Both <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">the US Senate</a> and <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">the UK government</a> are in the process of introducing guidelines and crafting policies that address these matters.

A partnership <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">between Microsoft and Baidu</a> brought together two of the world&apos;s largest tech companies, with Microsoft lending the capabilities of its public cloud platform Azure to Baidu&apos;s AV platform Apollo.

A fleet of Chevy Bolt EV test cars run seven days a week, for 16 to 24 hours per day. Within the next two months, the fleet is set to expand with the addition of more than 100 Bolts. That increase would, in theory, make the Cruise service available at all times, although the user base figures to scale up alongside the influx of vehicles.

Users know that an updated one is going to be released in September.</p><p>Generally speaking, auto enthusiasts have the same luxury. If they want to have the latest model of a given car for the longest period of time possible, they know they can get 12 guaranteed months of up-to-dateness if they buy a new model when it&apos;s first released.</p><p>Of all the luxuries that go along with being a Tesla owner, this type of annual consistency is not one of them. Tesla does away with the traditional "model year" product rollout cycle.</p><p>Tesla owners wouldn&apos;t have it any other way.</p><p>The method of deliberate innovation that eschews yearly vehicle release cycles is the same ethos that leads the company to consistently deliver revolutionary cars to market. But Tesla does make adjustments to certain models already on the market, which can result in a Model X sold one week being different than one sold two weeks later.</p><p>This issue came to something of a head recently, <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/08/09/tesla-autopilot-2-5-hardware-computer-autonomous-driving/" target="new">when Electrek reported</a> that Tesla has begun to equip its cars with computer hardware known as Autopilot 2.5 hardware (or HW 2.5), an upgrade from HW 2.0. </p><p>The brief history of Tesla&apos;s autopilot hardware is this: Beginning in September 2014, Tesla began outfitting its vehicles with HW 1.0 to enable limited autonomous functionality. HW 1.0 featured a windshield-mounted camera, a front-facing radar and several ultrasonic sensors. In October 2016, Tesla began to equip all its vehicles with HW 2.0, which featured eight cameras and various other significant upgrades.</p><p>The company boldly proclaimed that the Autopilot 2.0 hardware possessed everything a car would need to operate fully autonomously, and that those features would be forthcoming via over-the-air updates once software was up to snuff and the regulatory conditions were right.</p><p>"Before activating the features enabled by the new hardware, we will further calibrate the system using millions of miles of real-world driving to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience," reads <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware%20" target="new">a post from Tesla</a>.</p><p>Which brings us to the recently discovered HW 2.5. If HW 2.0 is truly capable of delivering a self-driving experience, why would 2.5 even be necessary -- and what does it have that 2.0 doesn&apos;t?</p><p>"The internal name HW 2.5 is an overstatement, and instead it should be called something more like HW 2.1," a Tesla spokesperson wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16119746/tesla-self-driving-hardware-upgrade-hw-2-5" target="new">in a statement</a>. "This hardware set has some added computing and wiring redundancy, which very slightly improves reliability... However, we still expect to achieve full self-driving capability with safety more than twice as good as the average human driver without making any hardware changes to HW 2.0. If this does not turn out to be the case, which we think is highly unlikely, we will upgrade customers to the 2.5 computer at no cost."</p><p>The statement doesn&apos;t answer a whole lot, although Tesla owners should feel slightly at ease knowing that they&apos;ll receive an upgrade if necessary. It may be awhile before we get an answer to that "if," and until then it appears we won&apos;t be getting an in-depth "why."</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Tesla&apos;s New Hardware Improves Autonomous Vehicle Capabilities' --post_excerpt='With the Hardware 2.5 upgrade, Tesla moves a step closer to full autonomy.

The technology may be ready relatively soon, but its cost could delay it becoming readily accessible to the masses.</p><p>Commercial enterprises share the concern as well. While autonomous capabilities figure to eventually help the bottom line for trucking companies, upfront investments in self-driving trucks figure to be enormous.</p><p>Indian startup <a href="http://fluxauto.xyz/" target="new">Flux Auto</a> is well aware of that problem, and it&apos;s going outside the box in its approach to fixing the issue.</p><p>The company wants to lower the cost of acquiring a self-driving truck not by manufacturing its own at a cheaper cost, but by devising a kit that could be retrofitted to pre-existing trucks to give them autonomous driving capabilities. To keep costs down, Flux Auto made the bold decision to not include Lidar sensors in its designs.</p><p>"While the competition is focusing on Lidar technology which is very expensive and processing heavy (due to a lot of unneeded data), our vision algorithms can be used with any cheap cameras and has a much quicker response time," founder Pranav Manpuria <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/flux-auto/" target="_blank">told TechCrunch</a>. "This drives down our cost and in turn, the cost for the customer as well, all while having similar levels of accuracy as a Lidar system."</p><p>Since <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">the high cost of Lidar</a> has been a frequent topic of discussion in the world of self-driving vehicles, developing an alternative solution for a baseline AV technology would seem like a sensible way of lowering prices.</p><p>It is, however, easier said than done, and Mapuria&apos;s assertion that a car could operate autonomously "with any cheap cameras" is one that will need to be seen to be believed. Currently, Lidar represents the core piece of AV development for nearly every major player in the space except for Tesla, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">as well as some ex-Tesla engineers</a>.</p><p>Auto Flux joins a bevy of competitors in the autonomous trucking space, a sector that many believe will have a major presence on public roads long before consumer vehicles do. Companies such as <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Einride</a> in Sweden, New York startup <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Transfix</a> and Peterbilt partner <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Embark</a> have all put unique spins on their approaches to autonomous trucking, although none quite as radical as Auto Flux&apos;s retrofitting method. Due to the prospective job loss that would come from the proliferation of autonomous trucking, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">there has been pushback from American unions</a>.</p><p>In India, though, where Auto Flux is based, there has been talk of not allowing self-driving cars on roads at all. "We won&apos;t allow any technology that takes away jobs," Indian union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">said in July</a>. "In a country where you have unemployment, you can&apos;t have a technology that ends up taking people&apos;s jobs."</p><p>Gadkari&apos;s proclamation is yet to be followed by any formal legislation, and it&apos;s unclear if it ever will.

The dataplug, though, can also generate information that can be transmitted directly to the car owner&apos;s dealership.</p><p>Critically, this process will only take place if the customer opts in.</p><p>For dealers, the benefits of having access to consumer diagnostics are numerous. Understanding the driving habits of their customers -- how often they drive, where they drive, how fast they drive, how frequently they stop for gas -- would help dealerships better market their offerings and cater to their customers&apos; needs. The most valuable information these dealerships could access would be certain diagnostics on a given vehicle&apos;s systems. If a dealer saw that they had a customer in need of an oil change or, a brake pad replacement, they could contact the car owner to set up an appointment for servicing. Dealerships could incentivize drivers to opt in to VWs service, or ones similar to it, by offering them discounts on repairs.</p><p>Volkswagen&apos;s optional system of offering data access to dealerships may present an interesting way forward in <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">an ongoing battle</a> over over-the-air updates that is occurring between OEMs and dealerships.</p><p>On one side are auto manufacturers, which are becoming increasingly capable of offering critical security patches to their vehicles via OTA updates. On the other side are dealerships, which fear that they will lose revenue from repairs when drivers are able to have a large portion of their vehicle servicing done remotely. If more dealerships were given access to consumer data, such a concession might convince them to lessen their resistance towards letting OEMs deliver OTA updates. Of course, there is also another party in the debate who will hopefully get a say in the matter -- customers.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='VW&apos;s New Telematics Service Raises Privacy Concerns' --post_excerpt='New Volkswagen telematics technology could give auto dealerships access to customer data, which is raising concerns.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='VW&apos;s New Telematics Service Raises Privacy Concerns' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-08-25 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-08-25 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,5,8" --tags_input='Volkswagen, VW, telematics, auto dealerships, connected car' --tax_input=''

(Level 5 autonomy, or full autonomy that requires zero human intervention, is merely theoretical at this point.)</p><p>With the Olympics only a few months away, though, Hyundai is already pushing forward some of the tech that it figures to demo in February.

This means, essentially, that it can perform highway driving with little intervention from a human driver. The tech nears Level 3 autonomy when on freeways. If Hyundai does indeed have Level 4 tech to demonstrate soon, then it must consider its lesser technologies to be quite far along.</p><p>With the Winter Olympics, though, comes the possibility of inclement weather, and snow and other winter conditions have been known to be a major obstacle for self-driving cars to overcome. Apparently, though, Hyundai&apos;s engineers are hoping for the best wintry mix they can get, as they believe their cars will impress with their performance in poor weather. Like most autonomous vehicles, Hyundai&apos;s cars use Lidar and radar, but they also use HD mapping technology to get a more comprehensive understanding of their immediate environment.</p><p>At shows and conventions, car enthusiasts are able to see an endless number of demonstrations that automakers put on to showcase their vehicles&apos; autonomous capabilities.

If not, the consequences, both intended and unintended, can be dire.</p><p>For self-driving cars, the consequences revolve mostly around safety. No one wants autonomous vehicles on public streets until they&apos;re fully ready to be there.</P><P>There are also, however, issues of public perception. When autonomous vehicles reach the point where they can safely travel on public roads in large numbers, they won&apos;t actually be able to do so unless people are willing to ride in them.</p><p>This is why having a firm understanding of just how many people currently have faith in self-driving cars is so important. Not only does it tell you about consumers&apos; current state of mind, it also can help clarify the amount and type of education, messaging and marketing required to move the needle.</p><p>A <a href="https://trl.co.uk/sites/default/files/Attitudes%20to%20AV%20TRL%20Report_final_PPR823.pdf" target="new">recent study</a> conducted by Royal Holloway at the University of London&apos;s Economic & Social Research Council and <a href="https://trl.co.uk/" target="new">TRL</a>, a research and consulting group, looked at consumer attitudes towards autonomous vehicles.</p><p>The survey&apos;s primary focus was on the UK, with over 60% of respondents surveyed in person in London and the rest answering questions online. The major takeaway from the survey results came from a single, overarching statement: "Driverless cars are a good idea." Of the respondents who answered, 81% replied that they agreed or strongly agreed, while a minuscule 1% replied that they disagreed or strongly disagreed.</p><p>For autonomous vehicles engineers anxious about how their products will be received, this is incredibly encouraging news.</p><p>However, of the survey&apos;s 233 participants, 148 were recruited through TRL&apos;s <a href="https://trl.co.uk/projects/gateway-automated-vehicle-research" target="new">GATEway</a> program for having expressed an interest in self-driving cars. A loose equivalent would be gathering a group of people who had expressed an interest in ice cream, and then asking them if they would like to eat some ice cream. Further, over 70% of respondents were male, and the survey itself notes that, in other studies, men have had more positive responses to self-driving cars than women.</p><p>It should be noted, though, that both Internet (non-recruited) respondents and women also had overwhelmingly positive responses to the idea of self-driving cars in this study.</p><p>Of particular interest are the thoughts gathered from a freeform response section at the end of the survey, in which participants riffed on whatever came to mind about autonomous vehicles. The study published every single one of these responses verbatim, lending great insight into how potential consumers of self-driving cars view the technology in their own words.</p><p>One discussed the ethical implications of forcing self-driving cars to choose between two devastating outcomes. "I think the discussion on potential accidents -- a car choosing to hit elderly vs. younger people in case an accident cannot be avoided -- will be very interesting." It&apos;s a dilemma that various scientists and ethicists have <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">worked on extensively</a>.</p><p>Another comment was aggressive in its advocacy for self-driving cars because of their safety potential. "The &apos;I like to drive&apos; argument is frankly worthy of contempt and should be immediately countered by facts about the harm human drivers cause."</p><p>It is tough to draw any broad conclusions from isolated examples such as these. But they do show that John Q. Public is concerned with many of the same issues that those in the autonomous vehicle industry are working hard to overcome.

"Although the sailplane is just one specific type of vehicle, the algorithm that makes up the AI system is designed to physically navigate a machine around in three dimensions.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Like any complex machine, there&apos;s no single part of an automobile that is <em>most</em> important.</p><p>Several components are essential to its operation. An engine and wheels are certainly up there, but headlights and windshield wipers play an important role, too. But as we progress to a future in which autonomous vehicles become more commonplace, some auto parts that we now consider to be fundamental could go the way of the rumble seat.</p><p>Naturally, the first conventional parts that engineers of a self-driving car might want to do away with are those that require the most human interaction: the steering wheel and pedals. Last February, <a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="new">Ford</a> applied for a patent for a car design that features a removable steering wheel and pedals and, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/176922/ford-autonomous-removable-equipment-patent/" target="new">as first reported by Motor1</a>, the patent was approved on August 10.</p><p>In the proposed design, a lock-in system would secure the steering wheel and pedals into their normal places, and also allow for their removal. When the wheel and pedal were removed from the vehicle to allow extra room for a driver in a self-driving situation, trim pieces would cover up the receiving niches, giving the area around the driver&apos;s seat a natural, streamlined look.</p><p>Considering how fundamental the wheel and pedals are to human driving, one supposes that the process of reconnecting these pieces to the vehicle would require several levels of physical reinforcement -- the consequences of a dislodged brake pedal are both easy and terrifying to imagine. With advanced hardware, though, it&apos;s theoretically possible that all a human driver would need to do to reinstall the wheel and pedals is simply press a button.</p><p>Vehicles that require no human intervention are deemed to possess Level 5 autonomy.</p><p>And a car without a steering wheel would clearly need to achieve that designation. But according to many experts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/toyotas-research-institute-head-says-full-autonomous-driving-is-not-even-close/" target="new">Level 5 autonomy only exists theoretically</a> at the moment.</p><p>Plus, the presence of a steering wheel provides comfort to drivers in a number of ways. As autonomous vehicle technology enters the marketplace, few consumers will be comfortable diving in headfirst. For these reasons, Ford&apos;s proposed design is likely for a test vehicle. Currently, all self-driving test cars on public roads are required to have a human driver on-board in case of emergency. Ford&apos;s with-and-without steering wheel prototypes would be useful in both the current regulatory environment and in future, more permissive ones. </p><p>Other than an extra foot or so of additional torso-level space, it&apos;s difficult to imagine many advantages of removing a steering wheel. But one possible improvement could come in the form of safety features. While automakers have optimized airbag placement around steering wheels for decades, removing steering wheels could ultimately allow for an even safer vehicle. It&apos;s just one area of innovation to keep an eye on as Ford and other automakers experiment with different AV designs.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Ford Patents Point to Removable Steering Wheel' --post_excerpt='Ford appears to be designing a car that can go from traditional to driverless with the removal of a steering wheel and pedals.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Ford Patents Point to Removable Steering Wheel' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-08-29 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-08-29 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='Ford, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, steering wheel, patent' --tax_input=''

The marketplace is now so crowded that it has become a necessity for companies to form alliances and partnerships with other industry players. Whether it&apos;s because of financial hurdles or tech challenges, no one can afford to go it completely alone.</p><p>It should come as no surprise, then, that the much-hyped alliance of BMW, Intel and Mobileye brought in another big-name member, Fiat-Chrysler, in August. BMW and Intel had joined forces in July of 2016 and the addition of Fiat-Chrysler gives the consortium a significant boost in automobile resources for testing and engineering, particularly in North America.</p><p>"In order to advance autonomous driving technology, it is vital to form partnerships among automakers, technology providers and suppliers," Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/fiat-chrysler-automobiles-join-bmw-group-intel-mobileye-autonomous-driving-platform/" target="_blank">said in a joint statement</a> from the four companies. "Joining this cooperation will enable FCA to directly benefit from the synergies and economies of scale that are possible when companies come together with a common vision and objective."</p><p>Up until now, the general perception has been that Fiat-Chrysler trailed fellow automakers like Ford and GM, but its new partners are likely to change that. In the same statement, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua spoke about the platform that Fiat-Chrysler will be making contributions to and benefiting from.</p><p>"We welcome FCA&apos;s contributions and use of the cooperation&apos;s platform, which has made substantial progress over the last year and is rapidly entering the testing and execution phase," Shashua said. "The combination of vision-intense perception and mapping, differentiated sensor fusion, and driving policy solutions offers the highest levels of safety and versatility, in a cost-efficient package that will scale across all geographies and road settings."</p><p>Outside of the marquee names, the partnership has plenty of other contributors since each company brings with it its own set of collaborators. One company that works with all of them is <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Delphi Automotive</a>, a leader in developing the computer software that powers and guides self-driving cars.

Fiat-Chrysler does, too, most notably with Waymo. It&apos;s leading to a "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"-style game with all of the AV technology partnerships. While it may be difficult to keep track of who is working with who, the sharing of learning is likely to lead to faster deployment of new technologies and accelerate the date when autonomous vehicles take to the streets.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Fiat-Chrysler Joins BMW-Intel Autonomous Driving Partnership' --post_excerpt='Fiat-Chrysler targets 2021 for autonomous vehicle production, and the company is partnering with Intel to get started.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Fiat-Chrysler Joins BMW-Intel Autonomous Driving Partnership' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-08-30 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-08-30 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='Fiat-Chrysler, BMW, Intel, Mobileye, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars' --tax_input=''
wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>When we hear the phrase "autonomous vehicles," the mind often goes to the most advanced version of these things.</p><p>To many people, a "self-driving car" is nothing short of an automobile with Level 5 autonomy, one that can navigate urban traffic and around accidents and find the perfect parking spot at a moment&apos;s notice. While no version of this car currently exists, plenty of vehicles that are already on our roads do have autonomous features.</p><p>Tesla&apos;s Autopilot, for example, is likely navigating a car on a highway near you right now in the US, and plenty of automobiles have self-parking features.</p><p>But the uses for autonomous vehicles extend far beyond the commercial and consumer realms. The Colorado Department of Transportation recently announced an autonomous vehicle whose primary purpose isn&apos;t to move people from one place to another.</p><p>Instead its main job is to protect people.</p><p>In August, the Colorado DOT unveiled <a href="https://www.codot.gov/news/2017-news/august/cdot-and-partners-drive-safety-with-world2019s-first-self-driving-work-zone-vehicle" target="new">the Autonomous Impact Protection Vehicle</a> (AIPV). As its name suggests, the AIPV is an autonomous vehicle with no passengers that is designed to intercept and absorb impact from oncoming vehicles that would otherwise strike workers in highway work zones. Traditionally, these vehicles have been piloted by human drivers. With an autonomous system accurate to within four inches, the self-driving vehicles figure to make roadways even safer.</p><p>Three different companies had a hand in developing these AIPVs: <a href="https://royaltruckandequipment.com/" target="new">Royal Truck & Equipment</a>, <a href="http://www.kratosdefense.com/" target="new">Kratos Defense & Security Solutions</a> and <a href="https://www.colas.co.uk/" target="new">Colas UK</a>.</p><p>The AIPVs work in tandem, with a "follower" vehicle trailing a "leader" vehicle that sends navigational, speed and directional data to their autonomous counterparts. According to Colorado Department of Transportation Executive Director Shailen Bhatt, the AIPVs will address a serious safety issue on the state&apos;s highways.</p><p>"Just in the last four years, there have been 26 incidents where a member of the traveling public struck a CDOT impact protection vehicle -- that&apos;s almost seven per year," Bhatt wrote in the announcement. "This is a dangerously high number when you consider that in some instances, a CDOT employee is sitting in the driver&apos;s seat of the vehicle that was hit. By using self-driving technology, we&apos;re able to take the driver out of harm&apos;s way while still effectively shielding roadside workers."</p><p>Danger around highway work zones is, obviously, not unique to Colorado, which had 21,898 car crashes take place between 2000 and 2014, resulting in 171 deaths. <a href="http://www.govtech.com/fs/data/Colorado-DOT-Launches-Autonomous-Vehicles-to-Improve-Worker-Safety.html" target="new">According to the Federal Highway Administration</a>, there was a crash every 5.4 minutes in work zones, plus 70 daily crash-related injuries and 12 weekly crash-related deaths in 2014. Removing a worker from the role of driving the most vulnerable impact truck will make these areas safer for drivers and workers alike. It likely won&apos;t be long before this technology spreads to highways in other states.</p><p>"Everyone&apos;s very excited about connected and autonomous vehicle technologies," Bhatt noted.

The iPhone 8 will be released in the fall, marking the ten-year anniversary of the release of the original iPhone in 2007.</p><p>For those hoping for an "iCar," however, the news is not as good. While Apple is still working on autonomous vehicle technology, the company reportedly abandoned plans to manufacture its own self-driving car some time ago.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/technology/apple-self-driving-car.html" target="new">New York Times report</a> by Daisuke Wakabayashi, who spoke with five people near Apple&apos;s work on cars, provides insight into how the company pivoted from working on an autonomous Apple automobile to merely focusing on tech that would work in cars built by different companies. The news should not come as a complete surprise as the tone of Apple&apos;s trademark caginess on its project has turned from sly to deflective in recent months, at least with regards to cars.</p><p>"One purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars. There are others," Tim Cook <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">said in June</a>. "We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It&apos;s probably one of the most difficult AI projects, actually, to work on. And so autonomy is something that&apos;s incredibly exciting for us, but we&apos;ll see where it takes us. We&apos;re not really saying from a product point of view, but we are being straightforward in saying that it&apos;s a core technology that we see as important."</p><p>Apple&apos;s abandonment of a proprietary vehicle isn&apos;t for lack of ambition. The folks at Apple tend to shoot for the moon, and that was the case with self-driving cars.</p><p>In a division code-named "Titan," high-level Apple designers, engineers and executives strategized on how to disrupt automobiles. They worked with conventional AV ideas like <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Lidar</a> and designs that did away with steering wheels and pedals altogether. But they also reportedly toyed with some incredibly futuristic-sounding plans such as the development of a spherical steering wheel and augmented reality imposed on windshields.</p><p>Ultimately, though, Apple struggled with some of the same issues common to all AV developers.</p><p>Autonomous technology is still very much an emerging one, and uncertainty about the direction of the industry seemed to prohibit Apple from going all-in on any one creative vision. There was much division, for example, over whether or not to design a fully autonomous car or a semiautonomous one, a question that Google struggled with for years before ultimately deciding on the former. For building an operating system, some wanted to use the conventional C++ while others wanted to use Apple&apos;s signature Swift programming language. There are parallels here to Tesla, which diverges from industry norms in several key ways, including its three-dimensional mapping systems and the way it sends over-the-air updates. </p><p>But Apple isn&apos;t getting out of the autonomous vehicle game altogether. The company will still have its hands in various AV projects. One of the few that we know about for sure is a self-driving shuttle that will shepherd employees around the company&apos;s campus. They&apos;re not the first to attempt this type of project. Starting this fall, EasyMile <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">will pilot an autonomous shuttle</a> in a California business park, and Navya will have an <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">active AV shuttle</a> on the University of Michigan&apos;s campus.

A commonly cited <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/self-driving-cars-could-save-300000-lives-per-decade-in-america/407956/" target="new">statistic</a> is that traffic fatalities will be reduced by 90% in a future when only self-driving cars are on the road.</p><p>That caveat -- <em>when only self-driving cars are active</em> -- is important.</p><p>Before we get to that point, we have to make it through a hybrid period, with self-driving and human-driven cars operating side-by-side. </p><p>A new study from Temple University provides some clues as to what that near future will look like. With funding from the National Science Foundation&apos;s Cyber-Physical Systems program, Associate Professor of Mathematics Benjamin Seibold and a team of researchers trekked to Tucson, Ariz., to test how just a small number of self-driving vehicles could affect traffic patterns when inserted into dense highway traffic. The results were quite encouraging.</p><p>"Our simulations indicated that it would be possible to eliminate phantom traffic jams if just one in every 20-25 vehicles were self-driving," <a href="https://news.temple.edu/news/2017-08-08/tested-human-drivers-self-driving-car-calms-traffic" target="new">Seibold wrote in a statement</a>. "The instabilities that human drivers unintentionally introduce by their driving behavior can be canceled by a single well-controlled autonomous vehicle."</p><p>A phantom traffic jam is one we&apos;ve all experienced but rarely quantified. It is initiated when a driver or a set of drivers start to brake for no discernible reason, causing a domino effect of slowing and congestion by the cars behind them.</p><p>It&apos;s a common and frustrating experience to get to the end of highway traffic and have speeds pick up only to realize that there was no good reason for them to have slowed in the first place.</p><p>On a test track in Tucson -- Arizona is one of the nation&apos;s friendliest states for testing autonomous vehicles -- Seibold and his team set up two different scenarios: a circular flow of traffic featuring only human drivers, and the same traffic pattern, but with autonomous vehicles substituted in for a small number of human-driven cars.</p><p>The difference was stark.</p><p>Raising the number of autonomous vehicles in a given traffic flow from zero to 5% can reduce congestion by as much as 40%. And the benefits go even further, according to Seibold.</p><p>"What the few autonomous vehicles can do is mitigate the adverse effects of congestion," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="new">Seibold noted</a>. "We take the same time to get to our goal but we do so safer, more comfortably and more fuel-efficiently. This has important economical, and also ecological, effects."</p><p>The results of the test hold up to basic logic since advanced machines are more precise than humans, and less prone to random lapses of judgment or miscalculations. Of course, the research was conducted in a controlled environment. Understanding the impact of autonomous vehicles on real-world traffic is still unknown.</p><p>"The results of any such simulation must be taken with a grain of salt because of all of the unpredictable ways people actually drive in the real world," Seibold added.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Legacy automakers were not the first entrants in the race to develop self-driving cars. That gave tech companies and startups a head start in developing the autonomous vehicle technology that has the potential to disrupt society in major ways.</p><p>The larger car companies could afford to wait it out, watch how the self-driving car space develops and then jump in when the time is right.</P><p>And that&apos;s exactly what they have done, taking advantage of their vast resources to strike partnerships with smaller companies that have been in the AV game from the beginning.</p><p>One thing large OEMs have done that is similar to their startup brethren is remain vague about exactly what their plans are. Since no one knows exactly where things are going, everyone wants to avoid making promises they can&apos;t keep.</p><p>For that reason, a recent Medium post by Sherif Marakby, Ford&apos;s vice president of Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification, was especially notable because it laid out specific plans for Ford&apos;s approach to AVs in the next few years.</p><p>Titled "<a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/building-a-business-enabled-by-self-driving-technology-875ca374ab8a" target="new">Building a Business Enabled by Self-Driving Technology</a>," Marakby immediately makes it clear that AVs will be at the center of Ford&apos;s strategy in the coming years, with an emphasis on ride-sharing and ride-hailing programs.</p><p>"We&apos;re developing self-driving technology because the world is changing rapidly. For many people who live in large cities, owning a car is no longer a viable choice," writes Marakby.</p><p>"Ride sharing and hailing is on the rise, and shopping at malls is giving way to buying online, which is increasing package delivery services," Marakby added. "Therefore, we&apos;re building a business to capitalize on both of these trends. We plan to develop and manufacture self-driving vehicles at scale, deployed in cooperation with multiple partners, and with a customer experience based on human-centered design principles."</p><p>The move towards the more communal ride-sharing and ride-hailing as opposed to private ownership of autonomous vehicles is part of a larger trend that, as Marakby notes, is set to be of special interest in urban areas.</p><p>ZipCar executive Jonathan Hampson recently suggested that self-driving cars <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">should not to be privately owned</a> in large cities. Platforms such as <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Harman&apos;s Car-as-a-Service Solution</a> empower manufacturers, dealers and others to manage fleets and offer these types of services more easily than ever before. </p><p>For Marakby and Ford, it&apos;s clear that a prioritization of ride-sharing and a prioritization of electric vehicles go hand-in-hand.</p><p>"Since the success of autonomous ride hailing or sharing and package delivery will be judged by the number of miles driven that generate revenue, or those carrying people and packages, we&apos;re focused on utilization time and the amount of time a vehicle can remain on the road," Marakby writes. "That&apos;s why the fuel efficiency and total range of a hybrid-electric vehicle makes the most sense initially."</p><p>Relative to how other major automakers talk about their approach to self-driving cars -- most lack specifics -- Ford&apos;s direct talk on their plan comes across as bold. More importantly, it allows Ford to stake its claim on vehicles and services that it has the power to deliver on sooner rather than later.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Ford&apos;s Self-Driving Car Plans Emphasize Ride-Sharing' --post_excerpt='Ride-sharing and ride-hailing will be a focus for Ford.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Ford&apos;s Self-Driving Car Plans Emphasize Ride-Sharing' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-09-01 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-09-01 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,7" --tags_input='Ford, Sherif Marakby, autonomous vehicles, OEM, self-driving cars, ride-sharing, ride-hailing' --tax_input=''

To make someone scared of space travel, watching <em>Alien</em> will probably do the trick. And if you wanted to show the dangers of time travel, there&apos;s <em>Back to the Future</em>.</p><p>In the Chicago City Council, Alderman Edward Burke recently used <em>Back to the Future</em> to prove a point about a futuristic technology, but it wasn&apos;t about time travel.</p><p>Instead Burke used the Marty McFly movie as a cautionary tale <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chicago-driverless-cars-regulations-met-20170821-story.html" target="new">about self-driving cars</a>. On August 23, Burke and Alderman Anthony Beale proposed an ordinance under which companies testing self-driving cars in Chicago would need to pay a $500 permit for each car, and only employees or contractors of those companies would be able to operate these vehicles. The proposal was not voted on, as aldermen would like to gather more information. </p><p>Burke expressed concern with potential AV issues like fleet-wide hacks, while Beale said that self-driving cars could take "hundreds of thousands of jobs" from Chicago residents.</p><p>"Malicious trickery, vandalism and the more deadly threat of driverless cars falling into the hands of terrorists that could crash it into a crowded urban center, a building, an outdoor market or a festival, raises serious concerns," Burke said.</p><p>Of course, many share Burke&apos;s concerns with safety and are already addressing them. Automakers and other automobile tech developers are <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">hiring cybersecurity experts</a> at a rapid pace to ensure that all connected cars, not just autonomous ones, are safe from hackers. The US Senate is currently working on <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">an Internet of Things security bill</a> that will create standards for connected car manufacturers and other IoT companies.</p><p>The economic problem raised by Beale, however, appears to have fewer proposed solutions. <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Various labor unions</a> are hoping to slow down self-driving car development until more thought has been put into the issue. But the most likely solution will be the development of new jobs instead of the preservation of outmoded ones.</p><p>The aldermen&apos;s proposed ordinance comes on the heels of one that would have banned self-driving cars in Chicago altogether, a measure that was rejected due to <a href="http://chicagoist.com/2017/03/31/is_the_self-driving_revolution_head.php" target="new">state legislation</a> that encourages testing AVs on Illinois roads. On the national level, too, one finds that legislators are far more interested in loosening AV regulations than tightening them.</p><p>Both Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives have thus far been enthusiastic about a bill that will <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">limit states&apos; powers</a> to strictly regulate AV testing.</p><p>Given this climate that is so intent on technological progress, it&apos;s not surprising that the proposed ordinance in Chicago is so toothless.</p><p>Even the most enthusiastic proponents of public testing of self-driving cars would likely see little wrong with what is effectively a small tax on the vehicles.</p><p>However, the city could be missing out on an opportunity.</p><p>Urban testing of AVs is especially valuable due to the complexity of the environments, and if Chicago doesn&apos;t step up to welcome the technology, other cities certainly will.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>The primary challenge for getting self-driving cars on the road is -- of course -- building self-driving cars. Despite staggering advances in autonomous vehicle technology, there is still a long way to go to perfect these capabilities.</P><p>However, there are additional challenges beyond the engineering ones. Establishing the legal baseline for these vehicles is the most important, according to Mike Ramsey, research director at technology research firm Gartner,</p><p>"The biggest hurdle will likely be regulatory," Ramsey said recently <a href="http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-road-to-connected-autonomous-cars/" target="new">in a Q&A</a>. "Governments will need to feel comfortable with the rules put in place before these cars are released to the general public."<p>Since a government&apos;s actions reflect the will of the people, a major step in advancing favorable autonomous vehicle legislation involves convincing individuals of the merits of AVs. And, according to Gartner, recently observed opinions could suggest that the needle is moving in a positive direction.</p><p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3790963" target="new">In a Gartner survey</a> that polled 1,519 Americans and Germans between April and May of this year, 45% of respondents said they would consider riding in fully autonomous vehicles. To some, that may sound like an underwhelming number -- Gartner actually frames it as 55% of respondents <em>not</em> being willing to ride in a fully self-driving car.</p><p>When you add context to the data, however, it becomes much more of a glass half-full than a glass half-empty scenario.</p><p>For starters, fully autonomous vehicles don&apos;t exist yet. Level 5 autonomy, the level at which a car can pilot itself anywhere without ever needing assistance from a human driver, <a href="http://jalopnik.com/this-video-perfectly-explains-the-levels-of-autonomous-1795068093" target="new">is purely theoretical at this time</a>. So without something concrete to react to, it&apos;s easy to understand why some respondents were leery. </p><p>Of more relevance was the response to another question in the survey: "Would you consider riding in a semi-autonomous vehicle?" To that question, 71% of respondents said yes. If and when people have positive experiences with semi-autonomous vehicles, they&apos;ll be emboldened to try the full version (when it exists). A willing rider in a semi-autonomous vehicle will likely become a willing rider in a fully autonomous vehicle.</p><p>The survey also yielded a few other interesting results.</p><p>For example, the number of people who used a ride-hailing or ride-sharing service increased from 19% to 23% over the last 12 months. This shift indicates an openness to an evolving automobile landscape. That openness will be key as the landscape starts to incorporate AVs.</p><p>"The automotive industry is investing in new safety and convenience technology at a rate not seen since the dawn of the automobile," Ramsey said. "The experience of owning and operating a car will be dramatically different in ten years."</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Drivers Warming Up to Autonomous Vehicles -- Study' --post_excerpt='New Gartner survey shows that the driving public is slowly warming up to the idea of autonomous vehicles.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Drivers Warming Up to Autonomous Vehicles -- Study' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-09-05 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-09-05 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='Gartner, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, survey, research' --tax_input=''
wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>A few years ago, augmented reality technology seemed primed to have a major cultural moment.</p><p>Hyped up by tech blogs, Google Glass captured the public imagination before it was ever seen by consumers. People envisioned themselves walking around with computerized eyeglasses that projected ratings onto restaurants they passed and traffic reports onto roads they were driving.</p><p>For a number of reasons, the reality of Google Glass failed to live up to the hype and was a large disappointment. Users could take photos and videos, but not a whole lot more. The whole thing officially sunk as aggressive users earned the nickname "Glassholes" and it became clear that augmented reality technology wasn&apos;t nearly far enough along.</p><p>However, Google Glass 2.0 has quietly found success in recent months <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-glass-2-is-here/" target="new">as a tool for industry</a>. It&apos;s not the only example of augmented reality technology breaking through. Last summer, Pokemon Go transcended the normal world of mobile gaming to achieve mass appeal, projecting images of animated creatures onto city streets through the screens of users&apos; phones.</p><P>It raised a significant question: Was AR back? Or, rather, was it arriving in earnest for the first time?</p><p>The answer is complicated. As CEO Vitaly Ponomarev of automobile navigation company <a href="https://wayray.com/" target="new">WayRay</a> described in a recent post for VentureBeat, the type of augmented reality represented by Pokemon Go or Google Glass is quite rudimentary compared to what is expected to be the technology&apos;s full potential.</p><p>"For true AR to hit mass market, the industry needs a rich app and content ecosystem and hero device(s) capable of handling it," <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/23/ar-will-drive-the-evolution-of-automated-cars/" target="new">Ponomarev wrote</a>. "That hardware is nowhere near ready. Developers rely on the smartphone screen as the main (if not only) means to deliver AR. Wearables are not really an option either, as it&apos;s almost impossible to shove the high rendering performance, convenience, and good quality wide-angled picture into a small form factor."</p><p>The implication is that larger form factors will be better suited to housing a full-fledged AR system and, as Ponomarev goes on to describe, cars are a natural fit.</P><p>The possible functions of AR in a car windshield -- imagine graphics that let you look into the restaurants you&apos;re about to pass -- are almost limitless. Navigation systems will be far more intuitive and eliminate the need for users to take their eyes off the road in order to look down at a small phone or in-car nav screen. Traffic information will be provided in real time, giving drivers a clear picture of how to get to their destinations most efficiently.</p><P>Once autonomous vehicles are in play, the possibilities expand to things like infotainment. In fact, according to Ponomarev, AR may play a key role in transitioning consumers to life inside a self-driving car.</p><p>"A passenger should at any time be aware of what is happening in the car: why it chooses the specific lane, which cars are around, how busy one or another road is, how the route is being calculated," writes Ponomarev. "Augmented reality is a natural way to visualize the decision processes in the car so the passenger feels safer and more comfortable."</p><p>Many companies, including WayRay, are already beginning to develop these technologies. So if you were impressed by Pokemon Go, just wait until you see what augmented reality can do in a car. The scope of AR is about to broaden significantly.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Autonomous Vehicles May Be AR&apos;s First Big Platform' --post_excerpt='Cars figure to be the first viable platform for &apos;true&apos; augmented reality.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Autonomous Vehicles May Be AR&apos;s First Big Platform' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-09-05 10:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-09-05 10:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,5,8" --tags_input='augmented reality, WayRay, Vitaly Ponomarev, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars' --tax_input=''

Ultimately, the Industrial Revolution created far more jobs than it eliminated, and grew the global economy by several orders of magnitude. The challenge now is to figure out how to do the same with  the autonomous vehicle revolution.</p><p>As CEO of consulting firm Deloitte, which has emerged as a leader in studying the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-study-future-of-autonomous-vehicles-in-minds-of-consumers.html" target="new">future of mobility</a>, Cathy Engelbert has a unique perspective when it comes to analyzing where the automotive industry is headed.</p><p>While some in her position have been hesitant to speak about potential job loss resulting from widespread use of driverless vehicles, Engelbert addressed the issue head-on <a href="https://qz.com/1041603/driverless-cars-and-trucks-dont-mean-mass-unemployment-they-mean-new-kinds-of-jobs/" target="new">in a Quartz post</a>.</p><p>"Putting our heads in the sand won&apos;t stop the inexorable advancement of technology," she writes. "So, an approach grounded in facts rather than sensationalism is critical. Neither Pollyanna nor Chicken Little will likely have an accurate picture."</p><p>While acknowledging that ride-hailing services have expanded driving as a job opportunity for workers in recent years, Engelbert writes that another, newer emerging trend -- ride-<em>sharing</em> -- will reverse that growth sooner rather than later.</p><p>"Many forecasts estimate that shared autonomous vehicle fleets will begin being introduced in 2020 and start materially cannibalizing the driver-driven segment by the middle of the decade," writes Engelbert. "That leaves a big question: What future jobs can these people take on, and what training and skills will they need?"</p><p>Her answer relies upon the belief that autonomous vehicle technology will make transportation and shipping far less expensive and far more efficient for the parties providing those services. That means both increased revenues for those companies and cheaper costs for customers, meaning more expendable income for everyone involved. Travel and leisure sectors of the economy will see continued growth, opening up new job opportunities that would theoretically be available to those displaced by autonomous tech, according to Engelbert.</p><p>She also sees the potential for entirely new types of jobs in the automobile industry.</p><p>"That could mean everything from maintaining vehicle fleets to remote monitoring," she writes.</p><p>Engelbert also points out that, as presently constituted, the trucking industry is far from saturated with drivers. In fact, it needs the exact type of additional help that driverless trucks could provide.</p><p>"The trucking industry faces a seemingly-chronic shortage of commercially licensed drivers, and the major industry group estimates that nearly 900,000 new drivers will be needed in the US over the next decade," she writes. "The industry also faces high turnover and low interest from younger workers."</p><p>As a result of a shift to autonomous trucking, Engelbert expects that those who do keep their jobs as truckers -- whether as drivers or monitors of self-driving trucks -- will see an increase in quality of life. They&apos;ll no longer need to drive such long distances, meaning less grueling work and more time spent with family.</p><p>Over the coming years, changes in trucking and other automotive sectors will reveal the degree to which Engelbert&apos;s theories are accurate. But focusing too heavily on her prophesy skills misses the point. What&apos;s important here is that Engelbert is discussing these issues in a frank, unflinching manner.

So imagine crossing the Canadian border, and your car&apos;s navigation services shut down because your service provider doesn&apos;t extend to other countries.</p><p>It&apos;s a distressing thought.</p><p>Fortunately, it&apos;s an issue already being tackled as more and more drivers find themselves behind the wheels of connected cars. One major player in this area is Dublin startup <a href="http://cubictelecom.com/" target="new">Cubic Telecom</a>. The company received a huge boost recently by raising $46.5 million in financing as part of its Series C round. Investors included <a href="http://www.audi-electronics-venture.de/aev/de.html" target="new">Audi</a> and <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/" target="new">Qualcomm</a>, as well as firms like Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and Valid Soluciones Tecnologicas SAU.</P><p>Cubic Telecom is now valued at $215 million.</p><p>Cubic was founded in 2007 to help solve the aforementioned scenario in which travelers struggled to find adequate cellphone services when abroad. While the company was a pioneer in that market, the types of services it offered were eventually adopted by major cell carriers.</P><p>So Cubic pivoted, and it now provides the same type of international solutions for Internet of Things devices, chief among them connected cars, as it once did for cellphones. Cubic CEO Barry Napier says its tech is now in nearly a million cars.</p><p>"Our connected intelligence platform has been growing between 23 percent to 25 percent every 55 days this year," Napier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/cubic-telecom-gets-46-5m-to-connect-cars-and-other-devices-globally/" target="new">told TechCrunch</a>.

This brings us to the self-driving car. Autonomous vehicles need a moral baseline from which they can make difficult either-or choices in case of an accident.</P><p>The question is, whose morals should they be using?</p><p>The Ethics Commission at the German Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure believes that the primary aim of self-driving cars should be to improve the safety of everyone.

"Another purpose is to increase mobility opportunities and to make further benefits possible. Technological development obeys the principle of personal autonomy, which means that individuals enjoy freedom of action for which they themselves are responsible."</p><p>There are a total of 15 rules.</P><p>Other rules outlined in the report narrow in on more specific matters.</P><p>"The public sector is responsible for guaranteeing the safety of the automated and connected systems introduced and licensed in the public street environment," reads Rule 3. This means the German government has taxed itself with the the heavy responsibility of ensuring that private business, in its eagerness to introduce new products, does not release underdeveloped autonomous vehicles on the road.</p><p>From an ethical standpoint, Rule 7 does the most to address an issue many have wondered about.</p><p>"In hazardous situations that prove to be unavoidable, despite all technological precautions being taken, the protection of human life enjoys top priority in a balancing of legally protected interests," it reads. "Thus, within the constraints of what is technologically feasible, the systems must be programmed to accept damage to animals or property in a conflict if this means that personal injury can be prevented."</P><p>In short, that means if a self-driving car is faced with deciding between whether to hit a dog or a human, it will hit the dog.</p><p>As driverless car technology -- and public acceptance of it --advances at a rate faster than most thought possible, governments and private organizations around the world are scrambling to address unanswered questions about how self-driving cars will function when they&apos;re on public roads in large numbers.</p><p>German researchers have determined that once we know how we want these cars to act from an ethical perspective, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">it will be fairly easy</a> to program them to do so.</p><p><a href="http://moralmachine.mit.edu/" target="new">At MIT</a>, the aptly titled Moral Machine lets users choose how they would act in difficult traffic scenarios if given the time to do so logically. Several large companies have also teamed together to form the <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/" target="new">Partnership on AI</a>, which concerns itself with these same questions and more.</p><p>With so many groups working to address these issues, it&apos;s likely that we will be able to achieve consensus before autonomous vehicles take the road en masse.

Then, there&apos;s the challenge of putting that technology into a physical car, whether it be a pre-existing model or a brand new prototype.</P><p>That&apos;s only the beginning.</p><p>Only certain areas of the country allow AV testing on their roads, and they require extensive permits and permissions.</p><p>All of these roadblocks are time-consuming, but they are also necessary to ensure that autonomous vehicles are not deployed prematurely, and that all of the proper precautionary measures are in place. Imagine if an issue like Samsung&apos;s exploding phones happened with self-driving cars. </p><p>However, according to an illuminating <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/inside-waymos-secret-testing-and-simulation-facilities/537648/" target="new">feature in The Atlantic</a>, we now know that <a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new">Waymo</a> has figured out a new way to test its vehicles to make sure they&apos;re safe: by operating them in a virtual world.</p><P>Until now, the project had been kept entirely under wraps -- as author Alexis C. Madrigal describes. The software used is called Carcraft -- a play on the massive multiplayer online game World of Warcraft. The "secret base," complete with real-world road architecture, is located in the Central Valley of California and is named Castle.</p><p>"Waymo has never unveiled this system before," writes Madrigal. "The miles they drive on regular roads show them areas where they need extra practice. They carve the spaces they need into the earth at Castle, which lets them run thousands of different scenarios in situ. And in both kinds of real-world testing, their cars capture enough data to create full digital recreations at any point in the future. In that virtual space, they can unhitch from the limits of real life and create thousands of variations of any single scenario, and then run a digital car through all of them. As the driving software improves, it&apos;s downloaded back into the physical cars, which can drive more and harder miles, and the loop begins again."</p><p>A key word there is "thousands."</p><p>To track a single scenario thousands of times on a physical road would take an unfeasible amount of time, and adding variables to those situations would multiply that already unreasonable amount of time by an order of magnitude.</p><p>By using computer simulations, engineers can test self-driving cars over and over, providing an invaluable element of repetition--and the clarity that comes with it -- to their operations. It also helps save money on physical prototypes, meaning Waymo can reinvest that money back into software development until they&apos;re ready to produce hardware at scale.</p><p>Perhaps most critical is that neither the tests in the physical world nor the ones that take place virtually exist in a vacuum.</p><p>Instead, both inform one another in every sense of the word, and create a feedback loop of learning that is accelerating Waymo&apos;s technological development at an incredible rate.</p><p>If other AV developers are doing the same thing, they may be eager to pull back the curtain soon for fear of giving investors the impression that they&apos;ve fallen behind. If other AV developers aren&apos;t doing the same thing, they should probably start today.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Waymo Creates Virtual Testing  World for Autonomous Vehicles' --post_excerpt='Alphabet&apos;s Waymo division has created a virtual world to test its self-driving vehicles.

This fall, Congress will weigh in on a bill package that restricts states&apos; opportunities to ban self-driving cars, and also gives the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration a far greater number of exemptions for driverless vehicles.</p><p>As AV technology has advanced, the national government has only grown friendlier towards its designers.</p><p>But the US is not alone in its enthusiastic reception to autonomous vehicles.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-trial-self-driving-trucks-platoons-roads" target="new">UK recently announced</a> plans to perform trials with platoons of self-driving trucks.

"The trial has the potential to demonstrate how greater automation of vehicles... can deliver improvements in safety, better journeys for road users and reduction in vehicle emissions. Investing in this research shows we care about those using our roads, the economy and the environment, and safety will be integral as we take forward this work with TRL."</p><p>The platooning of trucks enables them to have a lower level of autonomous technology than what we normally associate with driverless cars. A series of trucks follows a single leader truck that has a driver, and uses a wireless network to mimic its acceleration, turning and braking. The concept figures to save energy by eliminating unnecessary braking and reducing wind resistance for the driverless trucks.</p><p>"They&apos;re always able to talk with one another," <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-trial-self-driving-trucks-platoons-roads" target="new">Richard Cuerden</a>, academy director at TRL, told Wired.

For fleet managers they are essential, helping them track vehicles and monitor their condition.</p><p>There is one fleet manager, however, where telematics becomes even more critical: The Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>The DHS recently awarded a five-year blanket purchase agreement for vehicle telematics services to <a href="https://www.wexinc.com/" target="new">Wex, Inc.</a>, a payments solutions company based in Maine that counts fleet management technologies among its specialties.

We increasingly watch life&apos;s performances not in real life (or "IRL," as the kids say) as they did in Shakespeare&apos;s time, but on screens, be they on on our televisions, computers or phones.</p><p>And, perhaps, cars.</p><p>For entertainment companies, more screen time means more revenue generated through subscription fees or advertising deals. So it should come as no surprise that entertainment companies have their sights set on a future in which self-driving cars are commonplace on roads, and drivers are free to spend time that otherwise would be devoted to paying attention to the road. Reading, gaming and online shopping will all come into play, but the greatest potential is in streaming video.</p><p>It&apos;s a possibility that is already being studied closely.</p><p>In Ernst & Young&apos;s 2016 report titled "Internet of Things," the firm estimated the potential earnings for entertainment companies based on the assumption that the average American spends one hour a day in his or her car.</p><p>"If the focus during that time were to shift from concentrating on the road to watching video, that equates to more than $20 billion in incremental revenue for the video industry," <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/self-driving-cars-hollywood-entertainment/" target="new">according to the report</a>.</p><p>Twenty billion is a number that will make entertainment execs -- and any businessperson for that matter -- take notice.

Can the windshield be the movie screen of tomorrow?"</p><p>It&apos;s not at all a ridiculous idea, and it doesn&apos;t take someone with the job title of "futurist" to see why. The windshield of a car already essentially acts as a screen for viewing the road, making it a fairly ideal apparatus for watching video. However, Mercedes-Benz R&D engineer Alex Hilliger questions whether the seat orientation of the cars of today will carry over to the self-driving cars of tomorrow.</p><p>"We&apos;re re-envisioning the automotive experience," said Hilliger in the article. "The vehicle could have a lounge atmosphere, and the passengers face forward or backward. If you don&apos;t need a steering wheel or driver&apos;s seat, the car can be a new space."</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of uncertainty littering the road to our AV future, but a few things seem certain about that future itself. One of them is that when we&apos;re not driving, we won&apos;t just be absentmindedly gazing at the road in front of us.

The company is aiming to develop a vehicle with Level 5 autonomy, according to his report. Its first prototype is an all-electric car, and patents filed by the company reveal a design in which all four passenger seats face inwards, presumably eliminating any possibility of a human driving in Zoox&apos;s vehicles.</p><p>With the level of enthusiasm that surrounds anything and everything Apple, this series of hires may be the most attention that Zoox has received by the media.

For all four organizations, it was an opportunity to showcase their abilities in a sector that figures to change the world -- and they said as much.</p><p>"With our commitment to innovation and ongoing work in helping define the future mobility landscape, our involvement is a natural fit and we are pleased to join with our partners in this hands-free road trip," <a href="http://www.magna.com/media/press-releases-news/releases-news/2017/07/31/joint-news-release---international-autonomous-drive-to-highlight-great-lakes-region&apos;s-leadership-in-mobility" target="new">Tom Tuma</a>, global product manager at <a href="http://www.magna.com/" target="new">Magna</a> Electronics, wrote in a statement.</p><p>Now, Magna has inserted itself even deeper into the self-driving car space with a product that could be a game-changer. <a href="http://www.magna.com/media/press-releases-news/releases-news/2017/08/31/news-release---magna-unveils-max4-autonomous-driving-platform" target="new">The Max4</a> is "a fully integrated, customizable and scalable autonomous driving sensing and compute platform that can enable up to Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities in both urban and highway environments."</p><p>To be clear, the Max4 is not a self-driving car.</P><p>Rather, it&apos;s a self-driving <em>system</em>. It combines a bundle of physical components -- radar, Lidar, cameras, ultrasonic sensors -- with the type of highly advanced computer platform that&apos;s needed to assemble and interpret the information from all those components and turn it into the effective operation of a full-sized vehicle. Critically, Magna claims that the system will be adaptable to all types of vehicles, meaning that any car could become a self-driving one if equipped with the Max4.</p><p>"At the heart of this development is a desire to show the market Magna&apos;s breadth of capabilities and an autonomous driving enabling platform with subsystems that do not compromise the interior and exterior of a vehicle," Magna CTO Swamy Kotagiri noted in the announcement. "Our focus is on developing production-ready solutions that offer flexibility to integrate and the framework to enable Level 4 technology for when the market is ready."</p><p>Magna refers to the Max4 as "scalable" multiple times throughout its announcement, and that will be the biggest challenge for the system. One of the technologies it incorporates, Lidar, is well-known for being <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">difficult to scale</a> in the current climate. Lidar sensors shoot out millions of laser pulses per second to determine the exact composition of a self-driving car&apos;s immediate environment. It is, however, widely considered too expensive for mass market production. If Magna has solved that problem to any extent, that may be the biggest headline from this announcement.</p><p>"One of the targets for Magna was to simplify the way drivers engage with autonomous driving systems including the option of an intuitive and familiar cruise-control-like user interface that is controlled through the press of a button," reads the Max4 announcement. </p><p>Clearly, Magna is looking to make autonomous driving more accessible on multiple fronts. First, by creating a versatile product that is compatible with a large number of vehicles. And second, by making sure that the people operating that product are completely comfortable using it.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Magna&apos;s Max4 Autonomous System Works With Any Car' --post_excerpt='Magna&apos;s Max4 combines high-level functionality with adaptability.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Magna&apos;s Max4 Autonomous System Works With Any Car' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-09-14 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-09-14 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,6,8" --tags_input='Magna, Continental, autonomous vehicles, Level 4 autonomy, self-driving cars, auto parts' --tax_input=''

Depending on your heating setup, you could even be left cold in the winter, and you&apos;d definitely be without air conditioning in the summer. Without power for your modem, you would be without Internet access and, oh yeah, you might need some candles.</p><p>If that all sounds like a huge inconvenience, imagine losing power in an all-electric vehicle. It would be an even bigger, and potentially more dangerous, issue.</p><p>Of course, there are many differences between the two scenarios. Power outages in homes are usually from a grid issue, while electric vehicles run off of battery packs. As long as it&apos;s charged, a battery tends to be pretty reliable, but electrical failures still occur in vehicles. The problem is usually caused by short circuiting, and it can become a serious danger. This is a problem that quite simply <em>can&apos;t</em> occur. </p><p><a href="https://www.delphi.com/" target="new">Delphi Automotive</a> has placed tremendous emphasis on studying electric systems in cars, how they can malfunction, and what can be done to prevent that from occurring. In a <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170829/BLOG06/170829756/autonomy-48-volt-powertrains-amp-up-electrical-system-complexity" target="new">story for Automotive News</a>, Richard Truett went behind the scenes at Delphi to see how the company is developing backup systems in cars to ensure steady and safe operation.</p><p>"For safety critical systems, we don&apos;t want to leave the driver stranded," Delphi vice president of engineering Mary Gustanski said. "We [have to] make sure there is a way to get you where you need to be, maybe in limp-home mode. So, in the vehicle&apos;s electrical architecture we [might] go to centralized computing, one for safety and one for the electrical architecture because they end up backing each other up."</p><p>When it comes to building redundancy into a vehicle&apos;s systems, weight and cost are easily the two biggest factors for engineers. By using new, lightweight aluminum wires, Delphi is able to reduce both weight and costs compared to the traditional heavy copper cables used in vehicles&apos; electrical systems.</p><p>For Delphi, this electrical work is emblematic of the company&apos;s overall approach to solving the issues for tomorrow&apos;s car before they ever become issues at all. Investors are taking notice: The company saw its revenue <a href="https://www.delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-reports-second-quarter-2017-financial-results" target="new">increase 5%</a> in the second quarter of 2017. </p><p>Equally important for its long-term success is that other companies are just as enthusiastic about what Delphi is doing with electric cars, connected cars, self-driving cars and the various intersections of the three.</p><p>In May, <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/bmw-group-intel-and-mobileye-announce-delphi-as-a-development-partner-and-system-integrator-for-their-autonomous-driving-platform/" target="new">Delphi joined</a> the BMW-Intel-Mobileye (and <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">now Fiat-Chrysler</a>) partnership that has quickly become a major force in AV development.</p><p>"This is a great opportunity for Delphi to use its technical depth and experience with automated driving and electrical architecture to help the cooperation develop and deploy at scale," Delphi CEO and president Kevin Clark said of the partnership.</p><p>As demonstrated by the breadth and depth of Delphi&apos;s work in EVs and AVs, it&apos;s an equally great opportunity for Delphi&apos;s partners.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Delphi Looks to End Electrical Issues in Self-Driving Cars' --post_excerpt='Powertrain specialist Delphi is making sure the electric cars of tomorrow -- including driverless ones -- will run smoothly.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Delphi Looks to End Electrical Issues in Self-Driving Cars' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-09-15 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-09-15 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,5,8" --tags_input='Delphi, Intel, Mobileye, Fiat-Chrysler, electric vehicles, electric cars, connected cars' --tax_input=''

The capabilities of the hardware -- sensors, cameras and the like -- and the software that powers the AVs of today is remarkable, considering how recently companies began developing self-driving cars in earnest.</p><p>However, for these vehicles to be on the road in significant numbers and become a viable option for regular transportation, certain physical and digital infrastructure need to be developed. It&apos;s not government regulation or insufficient in-vehicle technology that remains the biggest hurdle to a full AV future, but rather the connective networks that are yet to be designed and built.</p><p>Fortunately, these networks are starting to come together, slowly but surely.</p><p>Qualcomm made big news recently with the unveiling of a new Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) chipset and reference design that could be a valuable tool in optimizing the capabilities of self-driving cars.</p><p>"Today&apos;s introduction of the Qualcomm 9150 C-V2X chipset builds on our leadership in automotive technologies, demonstrating our continued commitment to design and offer advanced solutions for safe, connected and increasingly autonomous vehicles," Nakul Duggal, vice president of product management at Qualcomm Technologies, wrote <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/09/01/qualcomm-announces-groundbreaking-cellular-v2x-solution-support-automotive" target="new">in a statement</a>.</p><p>"With its strong synergy with telematics and an evolution towards 5G, C-V2X offers benefits to the automotive industry by developing new capabilities for improving road safety, and enhancing autonomous driving and advanced connected services, while building on the ITS momentum and investments made over the last decade," Duggal added. "C-V2X is expected to support safer roads, increase productivity and decrease traffic congestion. We look forward to seeing our 9150 C-V2X chipset play a key role in assisting the global market to achieve these benefits."</p><p>Executives from Audi, Ford, Groupe PSA (of France) and SAIC Motor (of China) all came out in praise of Qualcomm and its latest product, a demonstration of the strength of Qualcomm&apos;s partnerships, which will help put its C-V2X tech to good use.</p><p>V2X is a term used to refer to all sorts of more specific vehicle communications systems, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), among others.</p><p>The technology is almost limitless and forms the foundation of why so many believe our AV future will feature roads that are safer and more efficient by orders of magnitude. For example, cars that can "talk" to one another with V2V technology are far more likely to avoid collision with one another and travel along effective traffic patterns, but also can pass along information that they have individually perceived, such as traffic irregularities elsewhere. A road on which all vehicles are in communication with one another will be a safer road indeed.</p><p>As emerging technology -- namely, 5G wireless networks -- is perfected and brought to market at scale, V2X offerings will become even more empowered to serve connected cars and their passengers.

The reality, though, is that the latter is becoming less of a concern than the former. </p><p>Up to now, legislative and regulatory bodies on the national level have been quite friendly towards the self-driving car industry, and more than a few state governments have been actively enthusiastic in promoting AV testing within their borders. As we look forward, things only look rosier on the regulatory front for the AV sector.</p><p>That belief was further confirmed this month, when US Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Cho unveiled "A Vision for Safety 2.0" -- a set of guidelines for AV developers devised in a joint effort by the DoT and the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration.</p>As the title indicates, it&apos;s an updated version of a previously released set of guidelines. And fittingly -- considering the fast-changing nature of the industry it&apos;s addressing -- Chao notes that a third version of the document is already slated for next year.</p><p>"The new Guidance supports further development of this important new technology, which has the potential to change the way we travel and how we deliver goods and services," <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/us-dot-releases-new-automated-driving-systems-guidance" target="new">Chao noted</a> in a statement. "The safe deployment of automated vehicle technologies means we can look forward to a future with fewer traffic fatalities and increased mobility for all Americans."</p><p>The guidelines are divided into two sections.</p><p> Section 1, which is entitled Voluntary Guidance, lays out 12 priority safety design elements for OEMs and other contributors to autonomous systems.</p><p>"Entities are encouraged to consider each safety element in the design of their systems and have a self-documented process for assessment, testing, and validation of the various elements," <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf" target="new">according to the document</a>. The safety elements described fall under subsections like "Object and Event Detection Response," "Validation Methods" and "Data Recording." Each subsection describes a general set of best practices for the corresponding area of AV technology.</p><p>Section 2 -- called Technical Assistance to States -- describes a similar set of best practices for the bodies regulating these designers of self-driving cars: federal regulators, state regulators, legislatures and state highway safety officials.</p><p>"As the technology grows and the horizon of [autonomous driving systems] changes rapidly, it is essential for each of these entities and interested parties to exercise due diligence in staying ahead of activity in a proactive -- rather than reactive -- manner," according to that document.</p><p>While cautionary in tone, the new set of guidelines is largely positive in its characterization of autonomous vehicle technology, even with regards to its still-developing nature. It approaches the issue with safety as its foremost priority, noting that driverless cars have the potential to make our roads markedly less dangerous.</p><p>"The major factor in 94 percent of all fatal crashes is human error," Chao writes in the introduction. "So [autonomous driving systems] have the potential to significantly reduce highway fatalities by addressing the root cause of these tragic crashes."</p><p>Other work by the federal government on AVs in the news recently has been even more positive, namely the bill unanimously passed by the House that is known as <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">the SELF DRIVE Act</a>.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Car keys have come a long way from their original iterations as simply pieces of custom-cut metal that could be inserted into a vehicle&apos;s ignition system.</p><p>Remote keyless systems were first introduced in the early 1980s, allowing drivers to unlock their vehicle from a distance with the push of a button. They&apos;ve become so commonplace, it&apos;s hard to imagine a time without them. Around 1995, transponder car keys first started rolling out. Using a programmed chip that disarms a car&apos;s immobilizer, transponder keys protected vehicles from being hot wired and stolen. </p><p>Nowadays, many car keys are not even keys at all, but remote devices that not only unlock your car but also act as a starter, all without a driver ever having to remove them from his or her pocket.</p><p>One problem with these, however, is that they fail to unlock a car when the car battery is dead. Despite all our advances, we still need the old fashioned mechanical key when all else goes wrong.</p><p>Until now, that is.</p><p><a href="https://www.continental-corporation.com/en" target="new">Continental</a> has introduced a virtual, unforgeable key that opens doors and starts engines, with the unlocking capability still available even when a car&apos;s battery is dead. The new product design is centered around a present and future where car-sharing services and fleet management are more popular than ever, a circumstance that calls for a rethinking of how various automobile systems are accessed.</p><p>The product is known as the Continental Smart Access system (CoSmA), and it allows for car doors that open and close independently.</p><p>"The intelligent door is a milestone in access technology, as for the first time, we can offer users an all-round package for hands-free and digital operation, from unlocking the car and opening the door to starting the engine," <a href="https://www.continental-corporation.com/en/press/press-releases/2017-08-29-intelligent-door-93854" target="new">Andreas Wolf</a>, head of Continental&apos;s Body & Security business unit, wrote in a statement. "With it, we are enabling an even more convenient and secure driving experience for drivers and offering more design freedom to manufacturers."</p><p>The innovation of enabling a car door to open even when the car battery is dead comes via a new means of storing energy.</p><p>The driver&apos;s side door will have its own supply, taken from the car but stored in the door itself. NFC allows drivers to use the emergency unlock system from a smartphone, which activates a security check before unlocking the doors.</p><p>The technology could have major effects on vehicle design, according to Continental.</p><p>"It also opens up more design freedom for carmakers, as they no longer have to develop a conventional key with a blade and can dispense entirely with the emergency lock in the door," reads a statement.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>It&apos;s easy to see why so many companies with autonomous vehicle aspirations start off by getting involved with trucking.</p><p>First, self-driving freight trucks should be on roads in large numbers before consumer automobiles are. While the initial price of consumer AVs will likely be too expensive for people to trade in their conventional human-driven cars at first, trucking companies will have the capital necessary to make large initial investments and will also benefit immediately from the savings brought about by AV operations.</p><p>In addition, for all the legitimate concern by drivers and unions over how autonomous trucks will affect jobs in the sector, the fact of the matter is that there is a shortage of truck drivers in the United States. Self-driving trucks will help alleviate that problem.</p><p>When software company and AV tech leader <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/drive-automotive-technology.html" target="new">Nvidia</a> announced in August that it was a lead investor in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2017/08/16/autonomous-truck-startup-tusimple/" target="new">a $20 million fund-raising round</a> for Chinese self-driving truck startup <a href="http://www.tusimple.com/index-en.html" target="new">TuSimple</a>, it was seen as a logical and savvy move.</p><p>It often seems that there is a greater diversity of technological approaches in AV trucking development than in consumer AV development, and TuSimple serves as yet another example of a company putting forth tech that we haven&apos;t seen elsewhere.</p><p>Instead of using the conventional (and <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">oft-maligned</a>) system of lasers known as Lidar that we so often see on self-driving cars, TuSimple&apos;s platform relies on eight cameras and three millimeter-wave radar units for its core hardware. The company says this gives it a significant leg up on the competition.</p><p>"With trucks, the sensors must be even more powerful due to the longer stopping times required," according to <a href="http://www.tusimple.com/core-en.html" target="new">TuSimple&apos;s website</a>. "Our platform&apos;s camera and millimeter-wave radar array allows for sensing distances of up to 200 meters from the vehicle, compared to the standard 80 meters using LiDAR arrays. This allows our system to safely observe its surroundings when driving heavy freight trucks."</p><p>In the interconnected world of AV development, there may be no single company that is multi-tethered to a greater degree than Nvidia. It is working on AI and deep learning cloud tech <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/gpu-accelerated-microsoft-azure.html" target="new">with Microsoft</a>, and its automotive partners form <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/automotive-partner-innovation.html" target="new">a long list</a> that includes Toyota, Tesla, BMW and Baidu. While the nature of TuSimple&apos;s relationship with Nvidia is unclear beyond this initial investment, the startup figures to benefit greatly from this new association.</p><p>"Nvidia is unrivaled in delivering the computing performance needed for autonomous vehicles," said Xiaodi Hou, CTO of TuSimple. "By combining Nvidia technology with our expertise in computer vision and artificial intelligence, we&apos;re building a world-class platform that will disrupt the freight industry. We highly value our strategic partnership with Nvidia."</p><p>Days after the investment was announced, news came out that TuSimple will test its trucks <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/082117_tusimple/chinas-tusimple-taps-tucson-as-test-site-self-driving-trucks/" target="new">in Tucson, Ariz</a>.

The amount of time people spend reading Yelp reviews and soliciting word-of-mouth advice when they need to find a new mechanic shows how essential these relationships are.</p><p>The nature of operating an auto repair shop has evolved significantly this millennium.

[the] 180,000 independent auto repair businesses in the United States, which could leave them at a disadvantage," writes Kessler. "Or worse, manufacturers will move data that shops need to fix cars, some of which is currently accessible by the OBD port, to these new connected systems, where it will be less accessible to independent businesses."</p><p>While much of the hype around connected cars touts the way in which they will improve the actual driving experience with features like improved navigation services and, eventually, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, an enormous part of the value of connected systems comes from how they facilitate the repair and servicing of vehicles.</p><p>Cars now self-diagnose a wide range of problems, even anticipating necessary and routine parts replacements ahead of time. These capabilities could be a boon for repair shops under the right circumstances, but the shops&apos; uncertainty as to whether they&apos;ll be able to access the necessary data has them worried about the future.</p><p>"A whole $300 billion-plus industry -- we&apos;d be up a creek," says one shop owner quoted in the story.</p><p>Kessler outlines two possible solutions.</p><p>First, individual manufacturers could license the collective data of all their vehicles to the entities that want to use them, from repair shops to insurance companies.</p><p>The second option, which Kessler says that auto shops and parts dealers prefer, is that "independent registration authorities" would regulate the flow of data, which would work on a car-by-car basis.</p><p>While auto body shops are seemingly more vulnerable in an uncertain future, every non-OEM participant in the automotive economy harbors some anxiety about their position in a landscape that will be dominated by connected cars.</p><p>Dealerships fear that <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">over-the-air updates</a> to connected cars will compromise their position as providers of parts and services. In a certain sense, these entities -- dealerships, parts dealers, auto body shops -- should be comforted by the fact that they&apos;re all in somewhat precarious positions together.</p><p>When everybody has something to lose, they&apos;re more likely to compromise to find a solution that works for everyone.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='What Connected Cars Mean for Local Auto Body Shops' --post_excerpt='Aftermarket access to car data will be essential in keeping the industry alive.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='What Connected Cars Mean for Local Auto Body Shops' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-09-19 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-09-19 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,5,8" --tags_input='auto repair, auto parts, connected cars, autonomous vehicles, on-board diagnostics, OBD port' --tax_input=''

The operation involves Tesla cars that travel in loops.</p><p>Specifically, Tesloop offers rides back and forth from various cities that are "looped" together. With service currently centered around California, Tesloop routes include Los Angeles-San Diego and Orange County-Palm Springs.</p><p>"Tesloop is similar to a plane, train or bus, taking the best aspects of each and wrapping it into a unique experience," according to the company&apos;s <a href="https://tesloop.com/" target="new">website</a>. "It is great for those traveling daily long distance commutes, the business traveler trying to get to LAX or for those reconnecting with family and friends. You can finally relax and stay productive when travelling while enjoying complimentary amenities such as wifi, device chargers, healthy snacks and drinks, travel pillows and headphones."</p><p>The company&apos;s teen-aged founder, Haydn Sonnad, started the company a couple of years ago, after presenting the idea to Elon Musk and subsequently receiving seed money from Clearstone Ventures, as well as angel investments from Facebook and Tesla itself. Since then, Tesloop has grown quickly into a legitimate operation with <a href="http://www.tesloop.com/team/" target="new">a formidable executive team</a>.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest news since the company&apos;s inception came early in September, when <a href="https://www.goodyear.com/" target="new">Goodyear</a> announced that it would outfit the Tesloop fleet with tires that come equipped with wireless sensors. The sensors will provide valuable information to Goodyear about fleet usage patterns and the performance of its own tires, while giving Tesloop data that will make tire management more efficient.</p><p>"We want to build the future, not just observe or read about it," Goodyear CTO Chris Helsel wrote <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/goodyear-announces-intelligent-tire-trial-expands-fleet-management-solution-for-semi-autonomous-fleet-300516252.html" target="new">in a statement</a>.

The embedded sensors will deliver vehicle data that -- using Goodyear&apos;s proprietary algorithms -- will predict when tires need servicing or replacement. This will reduce costs and the amount of time that Tesloop vehicles need to spend in the shop.</p><p>"When you are operating cars nearly 24/7/365, minimizing tire incidents is critical to the customer experience and the business model," Tesloop CEO Rahul Sonnad noted.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>When Audi introduced its latest A8 in Barcelona this July, it immediately became one of the most advanced cars on the consumer market in terms of autonomy.</p><p>It&apos;s the first production vehicle to feature Level 3 autonomy, which means the vehicle will be able to drive itself entirely for certain portions of a trip, according to the auto maker. The new A8 comes equipped with a feature known as "AI traffic jam pilot" that allows an equipped car to drive itself at speeds up to 37 mph in stop-and-start highway traffic. Incorporating Lidar sensors, radar systems, cameras and ultrasonic sensors, it certainly looks like the full AV package that we&apos;ve been expecting.</p><p>Long before AV technology was ever viable in any capacity, a theoretical question has existed about responsibility and liability in the case of an accident involving a self-driving car.</p><p>As a pioneer in coming to market with a semi-autonomous consumer vehicle, <a href="http://www.audi.com/en.html" target="new">Audi</a> has taken it upon itself to answer this question, at least in the case of its own cars. If a driver gets into an accident when using AI traffic jam pilot in an appropriate instance and the fault of the accident is considered to be that of the A8, Audi will accept liability for the crash.</p><p>"When the function is operated as intended, if the customer turns the traffic jam pilot on and uses it as intended, and the car was in control at the time of the accident, the driver goes to his insurance company and the insurance company will compensate the victims of the accident and in the aftermath they come to us and we have to pay them," Thorsten Leonhardt, Audi&apos;s head of pre-development of automated driving, <a href="http://www.caradvice.com.au/582380/audi-to-take-full-responsibility-in-event-of-autonomous-vehicle-crash/" target="new">told CarAdvice</a>.</p><p>Note the emphasis here on the word "intended."</p><p>The industry is at a point where several vehicles on the market have autonomous features of various types, such as Tesla&apos;s Autopilot or the self-parking option available from a variety of manufacturers. The market, however, is not at the point where cars can completely drive themselves. There&apos;s ample opportunity for users to misunderstand the limits of the AV features on their cars, and therefore misuse them. Audi clearly wants users to know that AI traffic jam pilot is not an excuse to doze off.</p><p>Interestingly, while <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-liable-driverless-car-crashes-2016-10" target="new">Tesla made headlines</a> around this time last year for saying that it would not be liable for crashes by its AV system, it was, in effect, outlining the same level of responsibility that Audi recently claimed.</p><p>"No, I think that would be up to the individual&apos;s insurance," Elon Musk said at the time about the possibility of a Tesla crash involving Autopilot. "If it is something endemic to our design, certainly we would take our responsibility for that."</p><p>As far as Audi&apos;s adoption of responsibility, it seems like a necessary caveat that an automaker needs to make when putting AV tech to market. It probably will not, however, move the needle on sales of the A8 one way or another. After all, consumers aren&apos;t so much concerned with what will happen in the aftermath of an accident, but they <em>are</em> concerned with the ability of an AV to prevent accidents from occurring in the first place.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Audi Shoulders Liability Risk for Autonomous Vehicles' --post_excerpt='If the autonomous technology in an Audi falters, the automaker will be responsible.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Audi Shoulders Liability Risk for Autonomous Vehicles' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-09-20 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-09-20 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='Audi, insurance, liability, A8, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars' --tax_input=''
wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>What does it take for something to be considered a "real" self-driving car?</p><p>Autopilot-equipped Teslas and the new Audi A8 can&apos;t drive themselves everywhere, but these vehicles can take over for drivers for hours at a time. If we&apos;re waiting for autonomous vehicles to operate on a higher plane than that, however, it could be a while.</p><p>That means calling a vehicle a "real" driverless car is still largely subjective.</p><p>In a way though, that makes it all the more powerful. With no real standard to go by, the burden of proof is on the automaker to demonstrate that a creation is truly a breakthrough. So when Kyle Vogt, founder and CEO of GM&apos;s <a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new">Cruise Automation</a>, published a Medium post under the title "How we built the first self-driving car (really)," he was throwing down the gauntlet to the rest of the AV development world.</p><p>"While the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" >videos we&apos;ve previously released</a> show the most advanced self-driving software ever demonstrated, the most critical requirement for deployment at scale is actually the ability to manufacture the cars that run that software," <a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/how-we-built-the-first-real-self-driving-car-really-bd17b0dbda55" target="new">writes Vogt</a> in the September 11 post. "So, today, we&apos;re unveiling the world&apos;s first mass-producible car designed to operate without a driver. This isn&apos;t just a concept design -- it has airbags, crumple zones, and comfortable seats. It&apos;s assembled in a high-volume assembly plant capable of producing 100,000&apos;s of vehicles per year, and we&apos;d like to keep that plant busy."</p><p>While Vogt&apos;s post spends far more time describing the process by which Cruise designed this new car than he does describing the vehicle itself, he does offer some details -- most of which are framed in relation to previous Cruise AV designs.</p><p>Vogt states that the new cars "have almost completely new and fault-tolerant electrical, communication, and actuation systems that are unique to a driverless vehicle." He also says that the vehicle&apos;s wiring harness has 4,085 wires and 1,066 connectors, which he claims leaves little margin for error in his company&apos;s work.</p><p>"Without rigor and process, vehicles will spend most of their time in the shop while technicians chase &apos;ghosts&apos; (chafed wires, loose connectors, or anything else that causes things to suddenly stop working)," he writes. "As you can imagine, achieving massive scale with a low defect rate and high reliability is ridiculously hard ...

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Broadly speaking, autonomous vehicle hardware lags behind autonomous vehicle software.</p><p>Given adequate input, the computer systems that power self-driving cars are already incredibly effective at safely and efficiently navigating traffic, even when it comes to navigating around accidents or unexpected driver behavior in other vehicles. However, in order to work, these systems need a comprehensive understanding of what&apos;s going on in their immediate surroundings, and that&apos;s where the hardware comes in.</p><p>Various forms of sensors, including radar, laser and cameras are able to paint a picture that computers can then use to navigate.</p><P>Certain types of sensors, however, are necessarily less effective in certain conditions, including low lighting and adverse weather. Since a driver isn&apos;t only going to use their car when it&apos;s sunny out, overcoming these hurdles is a major challenge for autonomous vehicle developers.</p><p>One company believes it has found a solution.</p><p><a href="http://www.adasky.com/" target="new">AdaSky</a>, an Israeli startup with a team comprising engineers experienced in semiconductors and sensors, has introduced a product known as the Viper.</p><p>The showpiece of the Viper system is a Far Infrared (FIR) thermal camera. By detecting the thermal energy of surrounding objects, these cameras can provide the same sort of raw data for environmental perception that, say, radar or <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Lidar</a> can. Viper also includes algorithms that interpret this data, effectively building a three-dimensional map from which a self-driving car can operate.</p><p>But what really makes the Viper&apos;s thermal sensors stand out is that they are unaffected by the inclement weather and lighting situations that can render other sensors useless.</p><p>"We saw a powerful opportunity in the market," <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/adasky-launches-thermal-fir-sensing-solution-to-give-vehicles-247-vision-accelerates-fully-autonomous-driving-300516958.html" target="new">Avi Katz</a>, founder and president and CEO of AdaSky, wrote in a statement. "The most basic need for an autonomous vehicle is to be able to see and interpret what is happening around it, regardless of road conditions. Existing sensors and cameras available today can&apos;t meet this need on their own. To address this, we turned to FIR technology, which has been proven in other vertical industries and is mature enough to scale. We adapted the technology for the automotive industry and have been able to create a solution that performs at its best in use cases where other sensors fail."</p><p>In the same statement, AdaSky notes that the Viper is meant to be used as a supplementary technology to existing sensor systems, whether it be radar, Lidar, cameras or some combination of the three.</p><p>"Viper is the first high-resolution, thermal camera for autonomous vehicles with minimal size, weight and power consumption and no moving parts -- at a price suited for mass market," according to the statement.</p><p>Rather than an autonomous system unto itself, AdaSky is positioning Viper as a component of a larger AV architecture. If successful, however, it will be a critical component indeed.</p><p>"Feedback from testing has reflected that thermal sensing, in combination with the other sensors, can greatly improve general object, pedestrian, and animal detection," said Dror Meiri, vice president of business development at AdaSky. "Our FIR technology enables perception even beyond what evaluators initially thought possible. The time for FIR in the automotive industry is now. The technology is designed for scalability and automotive OEMs and new entrants know that to reach their vision of the fully-autonomous vehicle they need to achieve higher levels of perception and sight. Our camera and computer vision algorithms, trained by large amounts of annotated data that we&apos;ve collected, will empower the car of the future."</p><p>With competition in the AV sensor market heating up with each passing month, AdaSky seems wise to position its technology as complementary.</p><p>A startup pushing new technology and looking to get it in front of larger companies is smart to come in with a collaborative, rather than a competitive, approach.

"We need to solve for the challenges presented by not having a human driver, so designing a way to replace the head nod or hand wave is fundamental to ensuring safe and efficient operation of self-driving vehicles in our communities."</p><p>To replace those signals that humans can make but driverless cars cannot, Ford and Virginia Tech devised a light bar that was placed across the top of the car&apos;s windshield. To indicate that the car was about to come to a full stop, the car flashed two white lights that moved side-to-side across the windshield. To show that it was preparing to accelerate after stopping, a blinking white light flashed. And to indicate that the vehicle was driving autonomously (which it wasn&apos;t, actually), the car projected a solid white light.</p><p>Of course, no pedestrians or drivers that encountered the vehicle had been briefed on these signals. In creating the light patterns, engineers hoped to establish intuitive cues that gave pedestrians, cyclists and anyone else a clear idea of the intentions of an autonomous system. To assess the effectiveness of the lights, designers mounted the van with 360-degree HD cameras to track responses to the car&apos;s behavior. Developers are now reviewing this footage to see where they succeeded and where they can improve.</p><p>"This work is of value not only to vehicle users and manufacturers, but also to anyone who walks, rides or drives alongside autonomous vehicles in the future," said Andy Schaudt, project director at the Center for Automated Vehicle Systems at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute.</p><p>As autonomous vehicles become commonplace in the future, there will certainly be a standard for these types of signals that will remain consistent across all makes and models.

For Argo, it&apos;s an essential partnership: AV startups are faced with something of a low ceiling for their operations until they have access to an automaker to help produce and scale their product.

You ask the kids what they did at school; they reply with their typical mumbled non-responses. They ask you to pass the potatoes, and you gently remind them to ask for the potatoes <em>please</em>.</p><p>It&apos;s a typical meal, with one minor exception: Instead of sitting around the dining table in the living room of your house, you are in a self-driving car that is piloting you back from your kids&apos; soccer practice.</p><p>It may be tough to imagine that taking place today, but steps are already being taken toward a future that looks like that. It was recently revealed that <a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="news">Ford</a> has filed a new patent for a table that would be situated in the middle of an autonomous vehicle and surrounded by a set of inward-facing seats.</p><p>"The autonomous vehicle may include seats free to rotate during operation of the vehicle," reads the background section of <a href="http://www.autonews.com/assets/PDF/CA112137918.PDF" target="new">the patent</a>, which is entitled "Vehicle Table with Deployable Airbag."</p><p>"This may allow the occupants of the seats to face each other and to interact. This may also allow all of the occupants to relax, interact with one another, and focus on vehicle amenities. There remains an opportunity to design vehicle amenities for the occupants that takes into account the reduced operation monitoring provided by the autonomous vehicle," according to the patent filing.</p><p>If your greatest fear is having to sit facing your family members or commuting partners for an extended car ride, fear not: The patent also offers multiple proposals for how the seats could be configured.</p><p>"The seats may be mounted to the floor in a fixed position and... may be rotatable about the fixed position in a cross-vehicle direction and a vehicle fore-and-after direction," reads the patent. "Alternatively, the seats may be movable relative to the floor."</p><p>The patent pays a lot of attention to the specifics of the airbag that would be installed within the table.</p><p>This is fitting, since it appears to be one of the most well-developed concepts we&apos;ve seen for a product of this type. That said, it allows for plenty of possibilities as well. The patent gets into details with a high amount of specificity, including potential airbag materials. (If you were wondering, they include polyether ether ketone, polyetherketoneketone, polyester, or "any other suitable polymer.")</p><p>However, Ford had little to say on the matter.</p><p>"We submit patents on innovative ideas as a normal course of business," a Ford spokesman <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170918/MOBILITY/170919716/ford-patents-retractable-table-for-autonomous-cars" target="new">told Automotive News</a> in an email. "Patent applications are intended to protect new ideas but aren&apos;t necessarily an indication of new business or product plans."</p><p>That perspective is important, especially considering that the uncertainty with regards to the designs of future autonomous vehicles means that planning for them is inherently quite speculative.</p><p>Relative to other patents, though -- including Ford&apos;s <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">removable steering wheel concept</a> -- this table seems quite likely. When people aren&apos;t driving in their cars, they&apos;ll inevitably be doing <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">something else</a>.</p><p>And surely some of those activities will require a table. </p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Ford&apos;s Latest Autonomous Car Patent: A Table' --post_excerpt='In the future, automobile passengers will shift their gazes inward if Ford has any say.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Ford&apos;s Latest Autonomous Car Patent: A Table' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-09-29 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-09-29 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='Ford, patent, intellectual property, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, car parts' --tax_input=''

With a wide body, a vertically elongated windshield and hanging wheel wells covering the tires completely, it looked like nothing that is on the road today.</p><p>Jalopnik called it a "<a href="http://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-sedric-is-an-autonomous-space-caterpilla-1793018719" target="new">space caterpillar</a>."

As reported by <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170917/MOBILITY/170919808/vw-autonomous-fleet" target="new">Automotive News</a>, the Group has set 2021 as a target date for the launch of Level 5 autonomous electric vehicles of various kinds.</p><p>"Our team is already working on ideas for a whole Sedric family of fully autonomous vehicles for the city, for luxurious long-range mobility, through self-driving delivery vans and heavy commercial trucks," Volkswagen AG CEO Matthias Muller said in Frankfurt.</p><p>The company also announced plans to introduce autonomous ride-sharing services in two to five cities around the globe by 2021, via the mobility brands <a href="https://www.moia.io/" target="new">Moia</a> and <a href="https://gett.com/juno/" target="new">Gett</a> with which Volkswagen is affiliated. </p><p>Back when it first introduced Sedric in March, the company described an innovative-sounding system by which customers will hail rides in the future.</p><p>"A single touch of the button guarantees mobility for everyone, at any time, and at any location," read the <a href="https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/detailpage/-/detail/Individual-mobility-redefined-Autonomous-driving-at-the-touch-of-a-button/view/4669348/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da" target="new">statement</a>. "The control element is made of a button to press and a ring which indicates Sedric&apos;s arrival time with colored signals and vibration signal that guides a person with impaired vision to the car."</p><p>The latest information on Sedric also provided additional perspective on the vehicle&apos;s unusual design, which Volkswagen head of design Michael Mauer said is engineered to make passengers feel comfortable and safe as they are first introduced to AV technology.</p><p>"Powerful bodywork pillars, distinctive wheelhouses and short overhangs give Sedric an impressively robust appearance as the epitome of safety and trustworthiness," <a href="https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/detailpage/-/detail/The-Volkswagen-Group-provides-an-insight-into-the-SEDRIC-model-family/view/5593310/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da" target="new">Mauer noted in a statement</a>. "The headlamps provide a design feature and take on the function of eyes. They make visual contact with people in the immediate surroundings and interact with them."</p><p>If Volkswagen can deliver on its timeline, the company could have the first self-driving cars that consumers will ride in for purposeful transportation.</p><p>These intentions have clearly informed the company&apos;s approach to design and user experience. Both the ride-sharing and ride-hailing plans, as well as Sedric&apos;s incredibly safe-looking physical design, are meant to put customers at ease with early AV experiences.</p><p>Of course a car that <em>looks</em> safe is different from one that <em>is</em> safe, and Volkswagen has a number of hurdles to overcome in order to regain consumer trust after its emissions scandal.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>One of the biggest challenges for any new tech industry is finding a workforce with the skills required to operate in a sector that previously did not exist.</p><p>It takes significant upfront investments of time, education and money to get workers up to speed. In the emerging field of self-driving cars, it&apos;s not surprising then that this is a particularly pronounced challenge.</p><p>For starters, it&apos;s a wide field with many different players.</p><p>There are many different job opportunities at some of America&apos;s biggest automakers and tech companies. The top of the Fortune 500 list is littered with companies that have autonomous vehicle ambitions, and they&apos;re all competing to fill a large number of positions.</p><p>However, it isn&apos;t a field in which anyone can walk in off the street and get a job. Specific and advanced skills are required. It goes without saying that not just anyone can build a car that drives itself.</p><p>The former leader of Google&apos;s AV project (now known as Waymo), Sebastian Thrun, saw this supply-demand issue up close and, after leaving Google, he decided to do something about it. Thrun launched <a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="new">Udacity</a>, an online vocational school of sorts that offers "nanodegree" programs for those looking to acquire skills in the hopes of entering the self-driving car industry.</p><p>In the way that Code Academy trains anyone to become a web developer, Udacity hopes to do the same for autonomous vehicle engineers.</p><p>Udacity got a major boost in September, when it was announced that the company was partnering with <a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new">Lyft</a> to provide funding for 400 scholarships for students to receive certification in the engineering of self-driving cars via an introductory nanodegree program.</p><p>"There is a significant talent shortage in this new burgeoning area of self-driving cars," Lyft chief strategy officer Raj Kapoor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/09/19/self-driving-car-godfather-to-train-lyft-engineers-offer-flying-car-classes/" target="new">told Forbes</a>.

Through the new Lyft-sponsored program, beginners will have the opportunity to gain access to work in this sector.</p><p>"When we launched Self-Driving Car, we thought it was more of a niche product, because very few kids go to college thinking &apos;I want to become a self-driving car engineer,&apos;" Thrun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/udacity-adds-a-new-intro-to-self-driving-cars-nanodegree/" target="new">told TechCrunch</a>.

To that end, BlackBerry recently announced that it would team up with <a href="https://www.delphi.com/" target="new">Delphi Automotive</a> to provide its QNX OS for Safety to support Delphi&apos;s platform for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>"There is no safety without security," John Wall, senior vice president and general manager of BlackBerry QNX, <a href="https://www.delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-teams-with-BlackBerry-QNX-for-autonomous-driving-operating-system-platform" target="new">noted in a joint announcement</a>. "With cyberattacks and threats to connected vehicles on the rise, it is imperative that auto manufacturers are provided with software that is safety certified, reliable and secure. This is an area in which BlackBerry QNX excels, and we look forward to the new opportunities this expansion with Delphi will bring."</p><p>The specific product that BlackBerry&apos;s technology will be supplementing is called Centralized Sensing Localization and Planning (CSLP), a "fully integrated automated driving solution" that Delphi plans to release in 2019. Delphi is part of a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">well-known partnership</a> to develop an autonomous platform that also involves BMW, Intel and Fiat-Chrysler.</p><p>It was not addressed whether BlackBerry QNX will be involved with the work of that consortium.</p><p>"BlackBerry QNX will provide a robust software infrastructure for CSLP and help advance Delphi&apos;s autonomous driving system," noted Glen De Vos, senior vice president and chief technology officer at Delphi. "Safety in high performance computing systems is paramount to a production ready autonomous driving solution."</p><p>De Vos recently spoke strongly about the need for the automotive industry to rethink the physical architecture of cars. As vehicle technology has evolved, an increasing number of electronic control units (ECUs) have accompanied a corresponding number of new systems.</p><p>De Vos believes the ECUs need to be consolidated.</p><p>"We have to move the car from an appliance to a device," <a href="http://wardsauto.com/technology/delphi-industry-must-go-digital-or-die" target="new">De Vos said</a>. "The problem has been solved before. The question is how to do it for automotive."</p><p>That specific issue does not appear to be part of Delphi&apos;s partnership with BlackBerry, but it may speak to the type of platform it is developing and the kinds of vehicles it can live in.</p><p>Autonomous vehicles require a number of different systems and certain redundancies need to be in place to ensure their safe operation.

The result is a lingering perception that satellite transmission is a fickle technology.</p><p>Advances in recent years, however, have done a great deal to improve the performance of satellite-based services. In particular, the proliferation of high-throughput satellites (HTS) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have made many of these services faster, cheaper and more widely available. It&apos;s a development that has empowered a variety of providers of satellite services, with one of the foremost being connectivity company <a href="https://www.kymetacorp.com/" target="new">Kymeta</a>.</p><p>On September 20 at the 2017 Visionary Satellite Access Technology (VSAT) Global conference in London, Kymeta chief commercial officer Bill Marks revealed that the company had shipped its first 400 flat-panel antennas from its West Coast headquarters.</p><p>"We have antennas in eight different platforms, in five different verticals, most of which are mobile, one is fixed," <a href="http://spacenews.com/kymeta-ships-first-400-flat-panel-antennas-confirms-talks-with-oneweb/" target="new">Marks</a> noted.

When in use, though, it&apos;s invisible. The MTenna can sit between the headliner and the roof of an automobile, measuring between eight to 12 centimeters in depth. At that size, it can fit into the OEM specifications for roof design of nearly all cars.</p><p>The satellite&apos;s connection speeds are fast. It can download at speeds up to 50 megabytes per second and upload at 10 Mbps. According to Brian Wang at <a href="https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2017/09/kymetas-flat-antenna-will-enable-the-broadband-connected-cars.html" target="new">Next Big Future</a>, it will operate at "5000 times the spectrum and capacity of cellphones" as more and more low earth orbit satellite networks are established in the coming years.</p><p>This, of course, would mean an explosion in connected car performance.</p><p>But the potential applications for Kymeta&apos;s products extend beyond just the consumer vehicle.</p><p>"There are lots of platforms that have not been able to take advantage of satellite before because of the nature of the platform," Marks said. "Trains are a good example of that. You can&apos;t put a mechanically steered antenna on top of a train because in a tunnel it would get knocked off so we are seeing a great success in markets that have never really used satellite before."</p><p>Marks also said at the conference that thousands of back-ordered 70-centimeter Ku antennas entered production at a Californian assembly line late in September.

By being able to detect objects at a farther distance, the vehicle is able to go faster. </p><p>The set of sensors that sits on the cars&apos; roofs, which includes Lidar, has seen a reduction in size and an economization of physical components, which makes producing the hardware easier and less expensive.

To this point, the tablets have mostly been used for selfie-taking and sharing experiences through social media.</p><p>Now the backseat iPads will provide footage of the car&apos;s surroundings that mimics how the vehicle&apos;s software perceives its environment. On the screen, objects that could affect a vehicle&apos;s actions- - traffic signs, other cars, pedestrians -- will be colored in orange, while objects that are "constants," like trees, will be colored in blue.</p><p>iPad operations in the front of the vehicle have been improved, as well.

"And it also extends into how can we provide additional, multiple factors of authentication to make sure that not only is it the right person who signed up for the service, but it&apos;s the correct person who&apos;s in the car as well."</p><p>While security is an essential part of connected cars, especially as data travels vehicle-to-vehicle, and from vehicle to the cloud, there are also opportunities for Gemalto and its partners to provide a more personalized, tailored experience.</p><p>"Once you know who&apos;s entering the vehicle, you can create a unique experience within that vehicle," Migon said. "Maybe there are radio presets that already have their Spotify account. The seat has been adjusted to their preferences based on previous rentals.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>In the automotive space, the economies of scale of legacy automakers allow them to enjoy certain privileges that are out of reach of most startups.</p><p>Despite recent challenges, OEMs still generate a lot of revenue, which, in turn, gives them the ability to invest capital in many projects -- including high-risk ones -- without putting their businesses in grave danger of failing. Automakers also have enormous fleets, which allows them to test new technologies or services in a large number of vehicles relatively easily.</p><p>New ventures aren&apos;t without their own advantages, however.</p><p>Startups can be far more nimble than century-old automakers, allowing them to pursue new innovations and to pivot operations faster to adapt to changing market conditions. </p><p>Given that an OEM&apos;s advantages can sync up directly with a startup&apos;s disadvantages -- and vice versa -- it only makes sense that they&apos;d choose to partner up to plug those gaps.</p><p>There has been an increasing amount of press around the number of deals between automakers and smaller companies in recent months, and new empirical <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/23/automakers-accelerate-their-interest-in-startups/" target="new">data from Crunchbase</a> quantifies just how much that is true. Here are the big takeaways:</p><p><strong>Car companies are investing far and wide</strong><br />As the graph shows, automakers did not make more than six venture or seed investments in startup in any individual year from 2012 to 2015. But that trend shifted dramatically in 2016, when 26 such investments were publicly announced. And it isn&apos;t slowing down. In just three quarters of 2017, there have already been 38 separate disclosed rounds of investments by major automakers. As Crunchbase reporter Joanna Glasner points out, these investments haven&apos;t been concentrated in any one area.</p>{image 1}<p>"We see sizeable rounds, for instance, for <a href="https://shift.com/" target="new">Shift</a>, a car-selling platform; <a href="https://www.chargepoint.com/" target="new">ChargePoint</a>, a provider of electric vehicle charging stations; <a href="https://turo.com/" target="new">Turo</a>, a provider of peer-to-peer car sharing; <a href="https://www.store-dot.com/" target="new">StoreDot</a>, a battery developer and <a href="http://www.momentum-ai.com/" target="new">Momentum.ai</a>, an autonomous-driving startup," writes Glasner.</p><p><strong>German automakers lead the way</strong><br />Between them, BMW and Daimler (the parent company of Mercedes-Benz) have participated in 29 investments since 2016.</p><p>Throw in the three deals that Volkswagen has been involved in, and Germany&apos;s Big Three has made more deals than every other automaker combined. Not coincidentally, these outfits were largely involved in making investments long before their counterparts. BMW iVentures was founded in 2011 to invest "in cutting-edge solutions focusing on BMW&apos;s current and future business in the technology and customer and service space," and the company moved quickly with a $5 million investment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/25/bmw-teams-up-with-invests-5-million-in-mycityway/" target="new">in MyCityWay</a> in February of that year. The firm has stayed active since, participating in two rounds announced as recently as September for companies <a href="http://www.thebanksreport.com/blog/fair-scott-painters-latest-venture-officially-launches/" target="new">Fair</a> and <a href="https://dspconcepts.com/" target="new">DSP Concepts</a>.</p>{image 2}<p>Notably absent from this chart are Fiat Chrysler, Nissan and Mazda which have hesitated to get into the venture capital game. Even the notoriously independent Tesla has participated in a round, for electric motorcycle manufacturer <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/01/29/tesla-founders-backed-alta-motors-unveils-new-electric-motorcycle/" target="new">Alta Motors</a>.</p><p>Of course, it remains to be seen how these investments will pan out. And the wide distribution of capital is indicative of traditional VC funds, which tend to have a diverse portfolio of companies with the hope that the one outfit that hits it big will outweigh the ones that don&apos;t succeed. But even taking an approach like that is a significant step for OEMs, and shows that they are willing to do what it necessary to influence mobility going forward.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='OEMs Increasing Investments in Startups' --post_excerpt='Major OEMs are aligning with startups to influence the future of mobility.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='OEMs Increasing Investments in Startups' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-10-04 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-10-04 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,7" --tags_input='OEM, venture capital, automakers, BMW, Daimler, iVentures, Crunchbase, connected cars' --tax_input=''

"Current federal motor vehicle safety standards do not address automated technologies, and in some cases directly conflict with them. We are looking for ways to address these conflicts in dated rules without weakening the important vehicle safety protections they provide."</p><p>The results of that effort were revealed when the American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies (AV START) Act was introduced by Peters and Thune on September 28. </p><p>"This legislation proposes common sense changes in law to keep pace with advances in self-driving technology," <a href="https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-thune-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-advance-development-of-self-driving-vehicles" target="new">said Thune</a>.

The most obvious barriers to deployment are measures of safety oversight. To achieve these aims simultaneously, the Act seeks to ensure that most autonomous vehicle regulation is done in the form of exchanges between OEMs and the federal government.</p><p>The AV START Act "requires manufacturers to submit safety evaluation reports to the Secretary of Transportation with information addressing important factors including safety, crashworthiness, and cybersecurity through documented testing, validation, and assessment," reads a press release. "Such reports must be submitted prior to the testing or deployment of a self-driving vehicle."</p><p>The Senate legislation is the second AV bill to be introduced in congress this year, with the first having been the similarly bipartisan <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">SELF DRIVE Act</a> in the House. Of the SELF DRIVE Act&apos;s many proposals, the most publicized has been the included measure that will increase the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&apos;s annual exemptions for autonomous vehicles from 5,000 to 25,000 immediately and, over the course of three years, to 100,000. The same proposal is included in Thune and Peters&apos;s AV START Act.

"Rather than filtering emissions at the exhaust pipe, today we have the ability to solve it at the source.

This will secure #UKPOUND#174m of investment in the area, creating over 500 jobs, mostly in engineering," said the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/509735/NIDP_2016-2021_final_web.pdf" target="new">document</a>. Until now, though -- 18 months later -- Dyson had refused to acknowledge the existence of the project.</p><p>While not exactly a career shift for James Dyson -- he is an inventor, after all -- the development of an electric car represents a significant departure from his company&apos;s current offerings. His memo struck a decidedly moralistic tone, condemning government and industry alike for knowingly advancing technology that contributed to global warming while willfully ignoring tech that could help solve the problem. He described shopping EV prototypes in the early 1990s, only to be ignored.</p><p>"In the period since, governments around the world have encouraged the adoption of oxymoronically designated &apos;clean diesel&apos; engines through subsidies and grants," he wrote. "Major auto manufacturers have circumvented and duped clean air regulations. As a result, developed and developing cities are full of smog-belching cars, [trucks] and buses. It is a problem that others are ignoring."</p><p>Clearly, Dyson has noble aims in pursuing what could be world-altering technology. But in an editorial for The Independent, Josie Cox points out several flaws in Dyson&apos;s hopes for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, while also espousing the use of ride-hailing services as an alternative means of making our roads more environmentally friendly.</p><p>"The ride-hailing market has exploded in recent years and redefined the transport industry," <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/james-dyson-electric-cars-tech-revolution-waymo-alphabet-toyota-telsa-elon-musk-a7970496.html" target="new">Cox writes</a>.

Companies like Uber and Lyft are called "asset light" because they don&apos;t actually own the vast majority of cars that are used to deliver their services, allowing them to maintain greater profit margins. The fact that cars are an asset that depreciate in value rapidly only adds to the ride-sharing companies reluctance to own them. Still, <em>someone</em> needs to own these automobiles.</p><p>This dilemma is the subject of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-09-27/tech-companies-grab-driver-s-seat-for-robo-car-future" target="new">a column</a> by Bloomberg writer Shira Ovide. Ovide&apos;s piece focuses on the newly established relationship between <a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new">Lyft</a> and <a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="new">Ford</a>, in which each company seeks to mitigate its own prospective weaknesses for a self-driving car future by taking advantage of the strengths of its partner.</p><p>"Lyft has a network of customers, growing demand for rides and strong knowledge of transportation flow within cities," Sherif Marakby, Ford VP of autonomous vehicles and electrification, wrote in a <a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/how-ford-and-lyft-are-teaming-up-to-take-self-driving-cars-mainstream-9bf2974a912a" target="new">Medium post</a> announcing the collaboration. "We have experience with autonomous vehicle technology development and large scale manufacturing. Both companies have fleet management and big data experience. With our combined capabilities, we believe we can effectively share information to help make the best decisions for the future."</p><p>That&apos;s all well and good, except for the fact that Lyft doesn&apos;t exactly have significant fleet management experience -- it would be more accurate to say that the company has <em>driver</em> management experience.</p><p>It&apos;s a distinction that Ovide seizes on.</p><p>"In the current transportation reality -- including on-demand options such as Lyft -- the burden of owning and maintaining cars falls to the drivers," she writes. "But in the planning stages of transportation without human drivers, there is a game of hot potato in which the tech companies are trying to avoid the responsibility and profit margin-busting potential of owning fleets of cars that will still need to have their tires rotated and oil changed."</p><p>But, as Ovide explains, OEMs aren&apos;t the only fleet owners interested in partnering with tech firms developing AV technology--rental car companies are, too, and for them it may be an imperative for survival.</p><p>"[Technology companies] know that owning fleets of rapidly depreciating vehicles is not the &apos;asset light&apos; business model that tech investors love," writes Ovide. "Google and Uber do not want to be Hertz. For one thing, Hertz&apos;s negative 1.6 percent net income margin the last 12 months is not a good look compared with Waymo parent company Alphabet Inc.&apos;s 22 percent net income margin."</p><p>They may not want to be Hertz, but they certainly could benefit from accessing the resources of a fleet manager of that size.

More subtle features, such as lane departure warnings, can have broader-reaching effects than one might think. They can cause a driver to reflect on whether he or she is too tired to even be driving in the first place, indirectly preventing accidents that might have taken place.</p><p>For bus or truck drivers, whose tasks are far more difficult than piloting an average passenger car, an ADAS can be especially useful in facilitating a safe and smooth journey. The limited visibility and wider turns that come with driving a large vehicle often leave a human little margin for error.</p><p>To help fleets provide their drivers with the necessary tools to drive effectively, <a href="http://www.mobileye.com/en-us/" target="new">Mobileye</a> has introduced Shield+, a retrofit ADAS that uses a suite of sensors to give drivers an advanced understanding of their surroundings. </p><p>"People are recording accidents instead of preventing them, my question is why?"

And a low visibility indicator lets drivers know when the system capabilities may be limited.</p><p>For fleets, the ability to retrofit trucks, buses or other large vehicles with Shield+ offers a significant cost savings from buying new automobiles with ADAS natively installed.</p><p>It also allows fleet operators to protect drivers and vehicles immediately. As Ayalon points out, even if all new manufactured vehicles came fitted with ADAS starting today, it would take up to 15 years for the majority of cars on the road to be ADAS equipped.

A driverless vehicle is forced to process far more information in a city than anywhere else. For some autonomous vehicle developers, this might be a reason to avoid testing AVs in cities, for fear of a mishap. But for CEO Kyle Vogt and his team at GM&apos;s <a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new">Cruise Automation</a>, city driving represents a challenge and, more importantly, a valuable learning opportunity for their self-driving cars.</p><p>"Testing in the hardest places first means we&apos;ll get to scale faster than starting with the easier ones," Vogt wrote in a <a href="https://medium.com/@kyle.vogt/why-testing-self-driving-cars-in-sf-is-challenging-but-necessary-77dbe8345927" target="new">Medium post</a> on October 3. "This may seem counter-intuitive, but by testing in densely populated areas we expose our software to unusual situations at a much higher rate, which means we can improve our software at a much higher rate.

Cruise keeps detailed and precise records of these interactions.</p><p>According to a chart titled "Instances of various maneuvers per 1,000 miles of autonomous driving," Cruise vehicles in San Francisco make over five times as many lane changes as those in Phoenix, over 24 times as many passes in opposing lanes, encounter over 39 times as many construction sites that require navigation, and encounter over 46 times as many emergency vehicles.</p><p>The city really is more hectic.</p><p>"Dense urban areas contain more people, cars, and cyclists that our vehicles must pay attention to at any given time (and sometimes even raccoons)," writes Vogt. "Our vehicles predict the future motion of each object and simulate how those objects might interact with others.

From their viewpoint, the primary barriers to large-scale autonomous vehicle adoption are technological and regulatory.</p><p>For those evangelical early adopters who have already fully bought into the idea of a self-driving future, it&apos;s easy to overlook one very important factor: mass consumer readiness.</p><p>The prospect of a car driving itself is still going to take a lot of people a lot of time to get used to.</p><p> It&apos;s not the idea of a self-driving car that worries would-be passengers, it&apos;s the possibility that <em>someone else</em> could be driving the car -- someone who&apos;s not in it, according to the results of a survey conducted by insurance company AIG.</p><p>The study of consumer attitudes towards autonomous vehicles, which is based on interviews with a 1,000 consumers, found that 75% of survey respondents feared that a car with any autonomous features would be vulnerable to remote hijacking by a hacker.</p><p>"As we move from autonomous features to fully driverless vehicles, risk does not disappear--it shifts from humans to machines," Lex Baugh, president of liability and financial lines at AIG, <a href="http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2017/10/03/466351.htm" target="new">commented</a> on the survey results. "Understanding consumer perceptions of where risk with new technology ultimately resides today will help industry and insurers understand where liability may lie tomorrow."</p><p>That fear of hacking likely played a role in 67% of survey respondents saying they feared their personal information -- credit card numbers, location services, private conversations recorded by microphones -- could be compromised in an autonomous vehicle. While certainly less frightening than the idea of someone taking control of a vehicle for an act of terrorism, the possibility of a data breach represents a crime that would likely be attempted with greater regularity. It also highlights a common misconception as to what types of vehicles could be vulnerable to outside attacks: It&apos;s not just autonomous vehicles that could be at risk, but all connected cars.</p><p>To combat these risks, automakers have put concerted effort into beefing up their cybersecurity capabilities.</p><p>This summer, the cybersecurity conference DEF CON hosted the <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Car Hacking Village</a>, one of many forms of outreach that the auto industry has used to make overtures to cybersecurity professionals.</p><p>Just how pressing are these issues? According to hacker and <a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new">Cruise Automation</a> employee Charlie Miller, there is not an imminent time crunch, but more open sharing among companies could improve the outlook for the future.</p><p>"I&apos;d love to see... more transparency about what steps they are taking. They say they&apos;re working together, but I&apos;d love to see academic people and researchers helping them as well.

In San Francisco, employees of GM&apos;s Cruise Automation get the incredible workplace perk of accessing autonomous ride-hailing using the company&apos;s own vehicles.</p><p>While these cars are technically self-driving, they are required by law to have human monitors in their front seats, ready to take over in case of emergency. It&apos;s a driverless experience, but it doesn&apos;t always seem that way when there&apos;s a person sitting in the driver&apos;s seat.</p><p>Now, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/the-people-who-matter-at-waymo" target="new">a report</a> from journalist Amir Efrati at The Information, <a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new">Waymo</a> is looking to launch its own driverless car network in Arizona as early as this fall, with a distinction that would set it apart from all other autonomous vehicle ride-hailing services: There won&apos;t be a driver in the car.</p><p>Certain folks within Waymo would like the service to begin picking up passengers before the end of October, according to the report.</p><p>That certainly seems ambitious, given that the company has not made any such intentions public. Even with a public announcement, launching such an unprecedented service within a month of announcing would still be an aggressive move. According to The Information, that aggression has been a major source of contention within the company.</p><p>As Efrati tells it, Google founders and Alphabet bosses Larry Page and Sergey Brin have actively been pushing for deadlines that engineers at Waymo consider to be unreasonably soon, while also implementing hiring freezes that employees deem to be hamstringing their progress.</p><p>Caught in the middle, it seems, is CEO John Krafcik.</p><p>In The Information&apos;s report, Waymo engineers see Krafcik as having sided with superiors because he doesn&apos;t have an adequate understanding of the complexities of self-driving technology.</p><p>The company does appear to be doing what its leaders say, and that appears to be launching an autonomous ride-hailing service. But what about that whole no-driver thing?</p><p>After all, federal law dictates that any self-driving car must be accompanied by a licensed human operator. But Waymo&apos;s decision to pursue this particular venture in Arizona, perhaps the most permissive state in the US with regards to AV testing laws in the country, is no coincidence. A September 2015 executive order by Gov. Douglas Ducey appears to have left a loophole.</p><p>"Pilot programs will be enabled on campuses of selected universities in partnership with entities that are developing technology for self-driving vehicles, whereby an operator with a valid driver&apos;s license may direct a vehicle&apos;s movement, regardless of whether the operator is physically present in the vehicle or is providing direction remotely while the vehicle is operating in self-driving mode," reads <a href="https://azgovernor.gov/file/2660/download" target="new">the order</a>.</p><p>Waymo, it seems, will monitor its vehicles remotely -- and control them remotely, when necessary.</p><p>"The company has built a real-time command center that allows self-driving cars to &apos;phone home&apos; and consult human operators about the best way to deal with situations it finds confusing," writes Timothy B.

More importantly, they are likely to have seen an autonomous car work in person. And this is a case where seeing is believing.</p><p>However, the self-driving car industry can also be guilty of operating in a bit of a bubble.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to forget that not everyone may be quite as sold on autonomous vehicles at this moment in time.</p><p>To gain insight into just what exactly the average American thinks about driverless cars, the esteemed Pew Research Center conducted a study about consumer attitudes that arguably dives deeper than any of its predecessors.</p><p>Even though "<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/10/04/americans-attitudes-toward-driverless-vehicles/" target="new">Americans&apos; attitudes toward driverless vehicles</a>" comprises only one of five sections in the "<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/10/04/automation-in-everyday-life/" target="new">Automation in Everyday Life</a>" report, the insights on the topic are both wide-spanning and nuanced.</p><p>The major takeaways from the survey results are that most Americans are familiar with self-driving cars and expect them to eventually become fixtures on our roads, but they are not as convinced about the viability of the current autonomous technology on roads today.</p><p>In the survey, 94% of respondents said they had heard about self-driving cars, while 35% had heard "a lot" about self-driving cars. Of that 35%, most were men and college graduates: 44% of men surveyed reported having heard a lot about driverless cars, while only 26% of women reported the same. Forty-three percent of college graduates had heard a lot about AVs, compared to 25% of those with high school diplomas. Most people felt that they had heard largely neutral or mixed things about autonomous vehicles, with 66% of respondents saying that they had been exposed to both positive and negative coverage on self-driving cars.</p><p>As far as timelines, 56% of those surveyed believe that most cars on the road will be driverless sometime between ten and 50 years from now. An optimistic 9% believe that point will come within the next decade, while 8% believe it will never happen at all.</p><p>And while the opportunity to ride in a self-driving car might seem like an exciting prospect to some, the (slight) majority of Americans aren&apos;t ready to make the leap just yet: 56% of survey respondents said they would not want to take a ride in an autonomous vehicle if given the chance.</p><p>"When asked to describe in their own words why they would not be interested in riding in an autonomous vehicle, respondents overwhelmingly bring up two major and often overlapping concepts," according to the report. "Some 42% of those who would not want to ride in an autonomous vehicle express a general lack of trust in the technology or an unwillingness to cede control to a machine in a potentially life-or-death situation, while another 30% specifically mention safety concerns of one type or another."</p><p>Americans hold a diverse array of opinions on many topics, and, as the survey shows, autonomous vehicles are no exception. What&apos;s encouraging is that most people who are still unsure about self-driving cars are reserving judgement instead of rejecting the technology outright.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='US Drivers Expect Most Cars Will be Self-Driving in 50 Years' --post_excerpt='A new Pew Research Center survey reveals American consumer readiness for autonomous vehicles.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='US Drivers Expect Most Cars Will be Self-Driving in 50 Years' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-10-17 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-10-17 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, Pew Research Center, survey, consumer behavior' --tax_input=''

"When an in-vehicle technology is not properly designed, simple tasks for drivers can become complicated and require more effort from drivers to complete."</p><p>AAA&apos;s study looked at 30 vehicle infotainment systems, and ranked each on a range from "low demand," the level of distraction imposed on a driver by listening to music or an audiobook, to "very high" demand, which is the equivalent of trying to balance a checkbook while driving.</p><p>The results were discouraging. Twelve of the systems tested were rated very high demand, 11 were classified as high demand, and seven were deemed moderate demand. No system was classified as low demand, the standard that AAA recommends for all infotainment systems comply with.</p><p>"These are solvable problems. By following NHTSA&apos;s voluntary guidelines to lock out certain features that generate high demand while driving, automakers can significantly reduce distraction," Jake Nelson, AAA&apos;s director of Traffic Safety Advocacy & Research, noted. "AAA cautions drivers that just because a technology is available while driving does not mean it is safe or easy to use when behind the wheel. Drivers should only use these technologies for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving related purposes."</p><p>As we know from other public education campaigns about distracted driving, such as texting while driving, the stakes are extremely high when people don&apos;t pay attention behind the wheel. And using an infotainment system is not inherently less distracting than using a cell phone. AAA found that completing tasks like sending a text message or programming a navigation system can take as long as 40 seconds for a driver, a time during which a car will travel the distance of four football fields -- and that&apos;s only going 25 miles per hour. The number of opportunities for disaster during these distracted time frames is scarily high.</p><p>The AAA Traffic Foundation for Safety isn&apos;t advocating that infotainment systems be eliminated entirely, merely that they be modified to prevent drivers from acting on their worst impulses. In the meantime, drivers should take it upon themselves to exercise restraint. There&apos;s no excuse for texting while driving, and activities like programming navigation systems and organizing a playlist should be done before a trip begins.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Infotainment Systems May Cause &apos;Potentially Dangerous&apos; Distractions' --post_excerpt='The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety wants infotainment systems in cars to require less attention from drivers.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Infotainment Systems May Cause &apos;Potentially Dangerous&apos; Distractions' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-10-17 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-10-17 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,4,8,9" --tags_input='distracted driving, infotainment systems, in-car navigation, AAA, traffic safety' --tax_input=''

Road signs, too, can be perceived and understood by autonomous systems, but there are far better ways of conveying directions to machines than red octagons and yellow triangles.</p><p>In Australia, the National Transport Commission has already spent significant time researching how roads will need to change to best take advantage of the safety and convenience benefits of self-driving cars.</p><p>In October, the commission published a discussion paper entitled "Changing Driving Laws to Support Automated Vehicles," a lengthy report that, if nothing else, enumerates all of the conceivable adjustments that need to be made to accommodate autonomous vehicles in the coming years. </p><p>The topics of the paper range from fundamental ("What does &apos;drive&apos; mean?") to more concrete ("Legislative approaches to recognize an Automated Driving System"). But one topic that stands out as particularly interesting is the topic of drunk driving -- or, in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, drunk riding. The report asserts that Australia ought to consider making drunk "driving" legal in cars that are driving themselves.</p><p>"One potential barrier to receiving the full benefits of automated vehicles would be to require occupants of automated vehicles, who are not driving, to comply with drink-driving laws," reads <a href="http://www.ntc.gov.au/Media/Reports/(E5695ACE-993C-618F-46E1-A876391B8CD9).pdf" target="new">the report</a>. "This would create a barrier to using a vehicle to safely drive home after drinking. Enabling people to use an automated vehicle to drive them home despite having consumed alcohol has the potential to improve road safety outcomes by reducing the incidence of drink-driving."</p><p>The comission&apos;s logic is sound, and exempting autonomous vehicle operators from drunk driving laws would seem to be a no-brainer, considering that they aren&apos;t actually driving.</p><p>So much of the positive publicity behind AVs centers around the prospective safety benefits, and part of that will come from a reduction in the number of drunk drivers on the roads. As the paper goes on to point out, though, there is still the possibility that drunk autonomous vehicle passengers would have the power to make dangerous decisions.</p><p>"A risk of providing exemptions is that an occupant may subsequently choose to take over driving the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs," it remarks. "If this occurred, they would become the driver of the vehicle and drink and drug driving offences would apply."</p><p>All of this is further complicated by the fact that we will see semi-autonomous cars on the road long before Level 5, fully autonomous vehicles. These cars may be able to complete entire routine trips by themselves, but still require that a human occupant be alert so they can take over operations if necessary. So until fully autonomous vehicles are on the road, don&apos;t expect to see major adjustments to drunk driving laws.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Australian Commission Tackles  DUI & Autonomous Vehicle Laws' --post_excerpt='A new report from an Australian commission seeks to make road laws suitable for an autonomous vehicle future.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Australian Commission Tackles  DUI & Autonomous Vehicle Laws' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-10-18 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-10-18 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,6,8,9" --tags_input='drunk driving, DUI, laws, Australia, National Transportation Commission, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars' --tax_input=''

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Within the last decade, app-based ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft have fundamentally changed the way that people think about mobility.</p><p>Ride-hailing has eclipsed taxis in cities where cabs once reigned supreme at an incredibly fast pace, especially considering how entrenched those pre-existing systems were. In less urban areas, the effects of these services have been even more significant. Those who were once relatively stranded are now able to easily obtain rides for affordable prices. </p><p>As profound an impact as these ride-hailing services have had, another, bigger transportation revolution is coming. A new report from consulting giant McKinsey details the way that self-driving taxis or "robo-taxis" will transform the way people think about mobility entirely.</p><p>"The success of robo-taxis will likely change car-ownership and public-transportation dynamics at a fundamental level," according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/gauging-the-disruptive-power-of-robo-taxis-in-autonomous-driving" target="new">the report</a>. "By offering lower mobility costs, greater convenience (for example, providing door-to-door service without disruptions), and increased productivity as they free occupants from driving, robo-taxis will change how people think about mobility in urban environments."</p><p>The report began as an attempt to explore a use case within the autonomous vehicle ecosystem, and the authors recognized the viability of robo-taxis by asking four key questions:</p><ul><li>What is being transported? (passengers or goods)</li><li>Who owns the vehicle (private or fleet ownership)?</li><li>Where can the vehicle operate (highway or urban <em>and</em> highway)?</li><li>What technology is being used (driving assistance, partial autonomy or full autonomy)?</li></ul><p>In a field of possible use cases that included long-haul trucking and last-mile delivery sources, the authors felt that robo-taxis represented the most promising.</p><p>Perhaps most interestingly, the report explores a scenario where the automotive industry could find it more profitable while, at the same time, consumers pay far less for transportation services. On the industry end of things, McKinsey projects that owning their own fleets and offering robo-taxi services will allow companies to better capitalize on a per-vehicle basis.</p><p>"By treating mobility as a service instead of a one-off transaction, automotive players could open new revenue pools worth billions, and in the process disrupt both the automotive and mobility business models," the report finds. "For example, a car company might earn only $2,500 on average for each car sold; spread over a 150,000-mile vehicle lifespan, that works out to about a penny a mile. The mobility-as-a-service model throws that penny-pinching approach out in favor of a more lucrative profit-per-trip focus."</p><p>Things sound similarly rosy for consumers in the report.</p><p>"The economics could convince people in large cities to switch entirely to shared mobility," the report says.</p><p>Up until now, robo-taxis have been seen as a single aspect of an autonomous vehicle future. But as the McKinsey report lays out, robo-taxis could represent <em>the</em> future.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='McKinsey: Self-Driving Taxis Will Disrupt Auto Industry' --post_excerpt='Robo-taxis have the potential to reshape urban environments, according to McKinsey.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='McKinsey: Self-Driving Taxis Will Disrupt Auto Industry' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-10-18 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-10-18 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,7" --tags_input='robo-taxis, self-driving taxis, ride-hailing, Uber, Lyft, ride-sharing, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars' --tax_input=''

Then there&apos;s football coach Steve Spurrier, who once said of a rival coach, "I saw a story saying Jim Haslett comes in at 4:30 every morning. That&apos;s not doing him much good."</p><p>Scott Miller, director of autonomous vehicle integration at <a href="http://www.gm.com/" target="_blank">GM</a> took a more direct approach when he addressed the Australian media in Detroit in early October. Discussing rival Elon Musk and Tesla&apos;s efforts to achieve Level 5 autonomy in the future with the same core technology Tesla uses now, Miller described Musk as "full of crap."</p><p>"The level of technology and knowing what it takes to do the mission, to say you can be a full level five with just cameras and radars is not physically possible," said Miller, as reported by <a href="http://www.caradvice.com.au/589512/gm-elon-musk-is-full-of-crap-on-teslas-autonomous-capability/" target="new">Car Advice</a>. "I think you need the right sensors and right computing package to do it. Think about it, we have Lidar, radar and cameras on [GM autonomous vehicles]. The reason we have that type of sensor package is that we think you need not be deeply integrated in to be level five, you should have redundancy."</p><p>Unlike most companies, Tesla does not include <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Lidar</a>, a sensor technology that makes an autonomous vehicle system aware of its environment by sending out millions of laser pulses every second.</p><p>While Lidar has been maligned for being unwieldy and cost-prohibitive, most autonomous vehicle developers consider it to be an essential, even foundational component of a self-driving car&apos;s suite of sensors.

In snowy areas of the country, mailpeople truly are the unsung heroes of our society. Trudging through unshoveled walkway after unshoveled walkway requires both physical and mental stamina.</p><p>Changing communication norms have reduced the stature of the mailperson job, and changing social norms have made the regular human interaction that used to accompany the job less and less common. Plus, at least according to television, you have to deal with dogs chasing you all the time.</p><p>Despite the difficulty of their work, many mailpeople find their jobs to be quite rewarding. A new USPS report finds those in the business of delivering the mail may receive significant assistance in their work in the years to come from self-driving mail trucks.</p><p>"Although much of the AV conversation focuses on how personal mobility will change, logistics could be profoundly affected as well," reads the introduction of the <a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2017/RARC-WP-18-001.pdf" target="new">Autonomous Vehicles for the Postal Service</a> report issued in early October by the Office of the Inspector General. "UPS, FedEx, DHL, and some foreign posts are already researching and testing the technology. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has also taken steps toward a pilot of a semi-autonomous delivery vehicle. This paper seeks to supplement that effort by providing a brief primer on the status of the technology and describing potential use cases for AVs in the delivery and transportation of mail."</p><p>The mailperson&apos;s job is to maximize efficiency by finding a parking spot that allows them to deliver within a certain radius, return to the truck, and then repeat the process in another area.</p><p>However, an autonomous vehicle could facilitate some steps, and eliminate others entirely.</p><p>It could locate parking spots on its own, giving the mailperson more time to deliver mail. It could also follow the delivery person around, which would both erase time spent walking back and forth from the truck and reduce the weight of loads that the deliverer physically carried. Further, the core principle of a self-driving truck -- the fact that it drives itself -- would be helpful with the delivery person inside the car. The deliverer could save time by sorting mail while the vehicle drove to a new neighborhood.</p><p>"In addition to saving time gathering the mail, AVs would virtually eliminate the time that carriers need to transition from driving mode -- hands on the wheel, feet on the pedals, eyes on the road -- to delivery mode, and back," according to the report.</p><p>The report also touts the possible benefits that autonomous trucking could bring to the USPS.</p><p>Driverless platoons of trucks carrying mail long distances on highways could save time, money and manpower. The possibility of, in certain circumstances, eliminating delivery people entirely in favor of on-demand AV mail delivery services is even floated, although it is something that would likely come about on a far longer timeline.</p><p>Thanks to email and other forms of electronic communication, many have come to think of "snail mail" as a relic of the past. But one need only look at the proliferation of Amazon boxes delivered by the USPS to find proof of the continuing need for the postal service.

At Level 3, a car can be fully in control for certain portions of a trip, like highway driving, but a human driver needs to be attentive in case he needs to take over in an emergency.</p><p>Level 5, naturally, represents the point at which a car can handle any driving situation without any human interaction whatsoever.</p><p>The word most commonly used by AV experts to describe Level 5 autonomy is "theoretical."  The number of bizarre situations that could occur on the road are almost infinite, which makes it hard to know when an artificial intelligence system would be able to process them all sufficiently.</p><p>That is why most companies have been reluctant to use the Level 5 label with their technology, even if it&apos;s referring to tech years (or decades) down the road.</p><p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html" target="new">Nvidia</a> is fairly unique in that regard.</p><p>In October, the company unveiled a new AI computer system that it claims will be able to power Level 5 self-driving cars.

Since these human monitors don&apos;t hinder the testing of an AV, there is little downside to their presence. The upside, of course, is that they could help avoid a potentially catastrophic accident, and a public relations disaster for all involved.</p><p>Still, autonomous vehicle developers are eager to test their products without the proverbial safety net of a human monitor.</p><p>Many companies have been successfully testing driverless cars on roads for years now.

A diagram of the vehicle sensor suite on a Waymo car -- which includes a Lidar system, radar system, camera vision system and supplemental sensors -- describes each component in a way that gives a readers an easy-to-understand sense of what each piece does.</p><p>"Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) works day and night by beaming out millions of laser pulses per second -- in 360 degrees --and measuring how long it takes to reflect off a surface and return to the vehicle," reads the report&apos;s description of Lidar tech. "Waymo&apos;s system includes three types of Lidar developed in-house: a short-range Lidar that gives our vehicle an uninterrupted view directly around it, a high-resolution mid-range Lidar, and a powerful new generation long-range Lidar that can see almost three football fields away."</p><p>Waymo also lays out its testing process, showing how it meets high safety standards before proceeding with on-road testing. The company tests its software and hardware through various forms of simulation testing, closed-course testing and real-world driving, each of which informs the other processes.</p><p>"As we drive more road miles, we continue to further refine our driving and update our software," according to the report. "This continual feedback loop allows us to build confidence that our software reacts and responds appropriately in the operational design domain, enabling our vehicle to operate at SAE Level 4 safely."</p><p>The comprehensive and clear look at Waymo&apos;s self-driving cars outlined in the report will go a long way toward earning public trust regarding the safety of Waymo&apos;s fleet.

There is also the share price of public companies in the AV sector, which reflect investor confidence.</p><p>A more direct measure of the state of the autonomous vehicle industry, however, is to look at how many self-driving cars are being manufactured. This can be a hard number to pin down, but inferences can be made based on tangential information. Based on recent news from Lidar manufacturer <a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new">Velodyne</a>, there&apos;s good reason to believe that AV production has exploded in recent months. On October 10, the company announced that it has more than quadrupled production of its Lidar sensors and doubled its number of full-time employees over the past six months.</p><p>"Velodyne leads the market in real-time 3D Lidar systems for fully autonomous vehicles," Velodyne founder and CEO David Hall noted in a <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171010005613/en/Velodyne-LiDAR-Quadruples-Production-Autonomous-Vehicle-Surge/" >statement</a>. "With the tremendous surge in autonomous vehicle orders and new installations across the last 12 months, we scaled capacity to meet this demand, including a significant increase in production from our 200,000 square-foot Megafactory."</p><p>The so-called "Megafactory" is Velodyne&apos;s newest facility, located in San Jose. The company has two other California locations, as well: A manufacturing facility in Morgan Hill and a research center in Alameda. The company&apos;s new employees are spread across all three.</p><p>Self-driving cars are generally equipped with various forms of sensors, and Lidar is one of the most prominent sensor types. Every second, Lidar sensors send out millions of laser pulses, which bounce off of surrounding objects. By measuring how long it takes these pulses to return to the sensor, Lidar systems determine the distance between a car and other objects in its surrounding environment.</p><p>But Lidar has also been blamed for <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">holding back</a> the production of self-driving cars. It&apos;s one of the most expensive components of a self-driving car, which hinders large-scale production of autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Elon Musk has long believed that Lidar will <em>never</em> be cheap enough for AV production at scale, and Tesla is one of the few driverless car companies that doesn&apos;t use Lidar at all.</p><p>There are also concerns about the technology&apos;s performance. In order to be effective at high speeds, Lidar systems need to be able to detect objects that are far away but fast approaching, and varying weather conditions can also impact Lidar&apos;s sensing capabilities.</p><p>That said, Velodyne&apos;s success, along with other recent news, suggests that the AV world still has confidence in Lidar. <a href="http://www.gm.com" target="new">GM</a> recently <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gm-cruise-strobe-lidar/" target="new">acquired</a> Lidar startup <a href="https://www.strobeinc.com/" target="new">Strobe</a> to bolster its sensor suites, and <a href="http://waymo.com" target="new">Waymo</a> has developed its own Lidar systems in-house.

"Without policies that encourage ridesharing of autonomous vehicles, reductions in travel time and cost will likely increase the number of single-occupant vehicle trips and their distances in sprawling metropolises. We thus forecast that AV adoption will have two impacts: it will facilitate densification in metros that have strong urban cores, but it will aid in the expansion of decentralized &apos;edge cities.&apos;"</p><p>Even with policies that encourage AV ridesharing, it&apos;s easy to imagine how the normalization of driverless cars would encourage people to move farther away from their workplaces. The prospect of a rush hour commute that is actually pleasurable because traffic is reduced and individuals are freed up to do new things could make drive-time road rage a thing of the past.</p><p>The report, which was underwritten by Capital One Commercial Banking, also predicts a transformation in urban transportation, brought on by autonomous vehicle usage.</p><p>"One of the most commonly-held theories predicts that self-driving cars will reinforce demand for central-city living," write Salazar and Saiz. "In this scenario, fewer driverless cars -- some with several concurrent occupants who use ride-sharing apps -- will indefatigably pick up, and drop off passengers. Demand for parking ought to decrease. Moreover, on-street parking should be replaced with bike lanes and wider sidewalks, while residential programmatic uses should replace garages."</p><p>While the self-driving car section represents only a small section of MIT&apos;s report, the fact that it is mentioned at all is significant.

The self-driving car has long been viewed as a possible solution in the future, but the city has been largely resistant.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>In October, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that GM&apos;s autonomous vehicle subsidiary <a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="_blank">Cruise Automation</a> would begin testing Level 4 self-driving cars in New York City early next year.</p><p>Cruise has already begun the process of mapping a geofenced section of the city.</p><p>"Autonomous vehicles have the potential to save time and save lives, and we are proud to be working with GM and Cruise on the future of this exciting new technology," Cuomo noted in a <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-cruise-automation-applying-begin-first-fully-autonomous-vehicle" target="new">statement</a>. "The spirit of innovation is what defines New York, and we are positioned on the forefront of this emerging industry that has the potential to be the next great technological advance that moves our economy and moves us forward."</p><p>The agreement represents a large step for New York, which had previously  taken a fairly conservative approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles.</p><p>The legislation is part of a program in the state&apos;s fiscal year 2018 budget that allows for approved testers to operate through April 2018. With Cruise&apos;s testing reportedly starting "early" in 2018, the company would have four months of testing at most before having to apply for the ability to continue.</p><p>The Empire State is also taking the additional step of requiring that two Cruise operators monitor the cars from inside during testing. Most states require one, and a few have eliminated the requirement for in-vehicle operators altogether.</p><p>As for Cruise, New York City certainly represents one of the best cities in the world to pursue one of its goals: testing vehicles in the most chaotic circumstances possible.</p><p>"Testing in the hardest places first means we&apos;ll get to scale faster than starting with the easier ones," CEO Kyle Vogt wrote in a recent <a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/why-testing-self-driving-cars-in-sf-is-challenging-but-necessary-77dbe8345927" target="new">Medium post</a> about testing Cruise vehicles in San Francisco.

The product quickly gained momentum, offering tourists cost-effective and unique lodging opportunities, and empowering hosts to bring in a not insubstantial amount of income.</p><p>The disruption to the travel industry has been enormous: The hotel industry continues to lobby municipalities for tighter restrictions on Airbnb hosting, and some hotel chains have completely revamped their customer offerings in an attempt to win back travelers.</p><p>Another company that can legitimately say it has been disruptive is <a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new">Lyft</a>.

It also helps Globetouch live up to its name by operating effectively on a truly global scale. "Globetouch provides connectivity services in more than 180 countries, including local network services in 11 countries," reads the report.</p><p>Globetouch has made connected cars one of its top priorities.</p><p>The company estimates that by 2020, the average connected car could run through as much daily data as 2,666 combined Internet users. And with that data being used to ensure the safe operation of vehicles, it makes having stable vehicular connectivity services all the more important.</p><p>Globetouch takes a 360-degree approach to the connected car ecosystem, recognizing that OEMs, consumers and service providers and fleet owners all have a <a href="http://www.globetouch.com/industry-use-case-1/" target="new">role to play</a> during the lifecycle of a connected vehicle. Globetouch&apos;s GStack is an innovative IoT/connected car stack that connects more than 800 network operations in over 180 countries under a single connectivity umbrella.

Plenty of surveys, studies and reports have been conducted to determine whether the public is ready for an autonomous future.</p><p>Naturally, the results are mixed and tend to follow predictable patterns. Younger people are more trusting of AV technology, for example. But each study is valuable in its own way. As more specific information becomes available on prospective users&apos; attitudes, the better companies are equipped to develop autonomous vehicles that make users feel comfortable and enthusiastic.</p><p><a href="https://www.edmunds.com/" target="new">Edmunds</a> recently released a particularly <a href="https://static.ed.edmunds-media.com/unversioned/img/industry-center/analysis/autonomous-report.pdf" target="_blank">useful survey</a>, entitled "Transportation Transformation: The Current State of the Autonomous Car." The scope of the report is a bit more focused than its title suggests, in a good way. While the survey takes stock of general consumer attitudes towards self-driving cars, it dives deeper by gauging customer interest in active safety features and analyzing which automakers are leading in this space.</p><p>"While there are a number of ways one can define who&apos;s &apos;leading&apos; in the race to autonomy, analyzing the prevalence of active safety features demonstrates just how ready OEMs are to bring this technology to mass production, and how willing consumers are to adopt it," Edmunds executive director of industry analysis Jessica Caldwell wrote in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/car-buyers-are-ready-to-embrace-autonomous-vehicles-new-edmunds-report-reveals-300541160.html" target="new">statement</a>. "While some car buyers may view a fully autonomous vehicle as a novelty, a vehicle that has the ability to prevent an accident before it occurs is seen as a safety breakthrough."</p><p>The survey, which is based on answers from 1,500 consumers, found that 65% of millennials would "feel safe" in a self-driving car that required a human in the driver&apos;s seat, ready to take over at any time. This number dwindles as the age of respondents increases, going down to 28% for those over 65.</p><p>Since millennials are the car buyers (or ride hailers or ride sharers) of tomorrow, these numbers are encouraging. However, since older people, who may not be as mobile, have a lot to gain from autonomous vehicles it is unfortunate that they do not feel equally safe with the technology.</p><p>As for active safety features, respondents seemed willing to pay for the premium feature. Forty percent of those surveyed said they would spend between $1,000 and $2,000 extra for a car with these types of systems. The features that were most attractive were blind-spot detection (61%) and pre-collision braking systems (52%). Drivers were less excited about adaptive cruise control (34%) and automatic parking (33%).</p><p>Using a methodology that rewarded automakers for putting active safety systems as standard features in a high percentage of its models, Edmunds also rated automakers on their AV safety feature offerings. With a score of 57, Tesla came out on top. Rounding out the top five were Volvo (47), Honda (37), Mercedes-Benz (36) and Mazda (34). Luxury automakers generally fared better in the rankings, as price points were not taken into account, which makes appearances by Honda and Mazda at the top of the list all the more impressive.</p><p>Active safety features are becoming more and more common in new vehicles, but there&apos;s still an enormous number of drivers that have never used them.

And the Bay Area, of course, is the primary testing site for more than a few AV outfits.</p><p>While harder to quantify, there is also a halo effect that occurs in pro-driverless car cities. They are able to brand themselves as forward thinking, which can lead to other progressive industries migrating to their borders.</p><p>So cities must be lining up to attract self-driving car companies, right? Not exactly.</p><p>A <a href="http://avsincities.bloomberg.org/" target="new">new project</a> by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Aspen Institute called the Global Atlas of Autonomous Vehicles in Cities charts where AV development is taking place around the world. The collaborative effort is billed as a tool for cities to gain an understanding of what their peers are doing to promote autonomous driving.</p><p>"This Atlas is the world&apos;s first inventory of how cities around the globe are preparing for the transition to a world with AVs," reads the Atlas&apos;s main page. "As cities seek to learn from one another, they can look to this map for up-to-date information on what&apos;s underway worldwide."</p><p>The Atlas lists 35 cities around the world that already have autonomous vehicle projects up and running. Geographically, the US has the highest number of cities participating with ten. In Europe, the UK and the Netherlands are leading the way with four cities each. And China has the most in Asia with three.</p><p>As news of autonomous vehicle development has spread, one might expect the number of cities that are researching AVs with the intent of launching pilot projects to be larger, but there are only 18 cities currently included.</p>{image 1}<p>The report acknowledged that even for cities that have pilot programs, things are still in the early stages.</p><p>"City planning for autonomous vehicles is new. Fully a quarter of the 38 cities surveyed only prioritized the issue in the last year. Fewer than 1 in 10 cities have been working on AVs for more than three years," the report found.</p><p>Solving "last mile" problems was the primary reason that cities decided to launch autonomous pilot programs. "The most common anticipated role for AVs is bridging existing gaps at the edges of transit systems." While those in more concentrated urban areas tend to have a number of ways to get around, those on the outskirts of public transportation and who might not be serviced by ride-sharing services like Lyft still have many issues getting around.</p>{image 2}<p>Understandably, launching an autonomous pilot program comes with a number of challenges for cities. Chief among those is money. The biggest barrier to AV pilots was "lack of funds." But on the positive side, "local opposition" to autonomous vehicles was tied for the smallest barrier.</p><p>Perhaps the best part of the Bloomberg initiative is that it is ongoing. Municipalities will be able to continually refer to it to learn more about which cities are getting involved with autonomous vehicles and how they&apos;re doing it. That kind of open exchange of information can only benefit the future rollout of more self-driving programs.</p><p><i>Images courtesy of Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Aspen Institute.</i></p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Autonomous Vehicle Atlas Shows Industry Has Long Way to Go' --post_excerpt='Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Aspen Institute created a comprehensive map of autonomous vehicle activity.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Autonomous Vehicle Atlas Shows Industry Has Long Way to Go' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-11-03 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-11-03 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,7" --tags_input='Bloomberg Philanthropies, Aspen Institute, autonomous vehicles, AV, city planning, driverless, self-driving cars' --tax_input=''

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>There is no shortage of news about self-driving cars coming out of the US. Silicon Valley is considered a global hub of autonomous vehicle development. And each of the Big Three automakers is pouring enormous resources into the industry, with promising results.</p><p>On the regulatory front, many new bills and and regulations that would create a more welcoming environment for testing autonomous vehicles have been introduced at both the state and local level. </p><p>However, the promise of autonomous vehicles and their ability to disrupt the way people get around is not limited to the US. Many global powers are developing their own AV technology and platforms that can compete right alongside those in the States. The UK, in particular, has been very active. And in mid-October, the country took a big step toward establishing a legal framework for self-driving cars with the release of The Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill. The legislation, which is currently making its way through parliament, could influence the way other countries in Europe adopt autonomous vehicle legislation. Here are the three major takeaways from <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2017-2019/0112/18112.pdf" target="new">the bill</a>:</p><p><strong>1. Insurers will be liable for accidents caused by AVs.</strong><br>There has been some speculation over whether autonomous vehicle manufacturers could be liable for accidents involving their cars, but the bill puts the onus squarely on the shoulders of the insurance companies.</p><p>"Where an accident is caused by an automated vehicle when driving itself, the vehicle is insured at the time of the accident, and an insured person or any other person suffers damage as a result of the accident, the insurer is liable for that damage," according to the bill. The issue still remains, however, about how insurance companies will determine when and how they choose to insure self-driving cars.</p><p><strong>2. Autonomous vehicle owners are responsible for software updates.</strong><br><a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Over-the-air updates</a> promise to help manufacturers keep their vehicles on the cutting edge of performance and safety.</p><p>The bill states that the vehicle owner will be responsible for making sure those updates are deployed. Failure to do so could result in a consequence far more severe than neglecting to upgrade to the latest version of iOS. If an autonomous vehicle owner doesn&apos;t keep his or her car&apos;s software current, it could remove the obligation of an insurance company to pay claims.</p><p>The bill says, "An insurance policy in respect of an automated vehicle may exclude or limit the insurer&apos;s liability for ... a failure to install safety-critical software updates that the insured person knows, or ought reasonably to know, are safety-critical."</p><p><strong>3. Gas stations may be have to become charging stations, too.</strong><br>Keeping in line with the common belief that autonomous vehicles will be electric vehicles, the bill also focuses on EVs.</p><p>Operating from the understanding that in order for electric vehicles to be viable on a wide scale, access to charging points needs to be plentiful, the legislation leaves open the possibility that gas stations may have to devote a portion of their real estate to charging stations.</p><p>"Regulations may impose requirements on large fuel retailers falling within a prescribed description, or service area operators falling within a prescribed description, in connection with the provision on their premises of public charging points," according to the bill.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='UK Bill Seeks Regulation of Autonomous, Electric Vehicles' --post_excerpt='The Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill paves the way for the UK&apos;s  autonomous future.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='UK Bill Seeks Regulation of Autonomous, Electric Vehicles' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-11-06 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-11-06 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,6,8,9" --tags_input='Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill, England, legislation, self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, driverless' --tax_input=''

"Ultimately, Pioneer aims to install 3D Lidar sensors in vehicles with Level 3 or higher autonomous driving technology on general roads, and applied in next-generation GIS service."</p><p>At the Tokyo Motor Show, a series Pioneer demonstrations showed just how the technology works.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Auto shows are a chance for automakers to invite consumers to dream with them. The most tangible manifestation of that is the concept cars companies reveal at the shows.</p><p>These vehicles are created less to take the road than they are to showcase an overarching concept or design direction that the automaker is moving toward. Over the years, there have been a ton of wild concepts, ranging from cars that fly, swim and transform. The idea of self-driving cars used to be one of these "out there" concepts, but as technology has advanced, autonomous vehicles have become a concept for today, not the future.</p><p>It was against this backdrop that Nissan came to the Tokyo Motor Show.</p><p>Presenting in its home country, <a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/" target="new">Nissan</a> faced high expectations to deliver a compelling, updated vision of Nissan Intelligent Mobility, its future-facing strategy for designing the automobile of tomorrow. And deliver it did. The Nissan IMx, a fully electric and fully autonomous concept car, was one of the biggest headline stealers of the entire show.</p><p>"The IMx zero-emission crossover concept vehicle embodies the future of Nissan Intelligent Mobility," Nissan executive vice president Daniele Schillaci in a <a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-a184dd62301d125a56b7fc4e88035f81-nissan-unveils-imx-zero-emission-concept-at-tokyo-motor-show" target="new">noted in a statement</a>. "Through Nissan Intelligent Mobility, Nissan is committed to changing the way people and cars communicate, as well as how cars interact with society in the near future and beyond."</p><p>Earlier this year, Nissan revealed that it would <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">bring its ProPilot technology</a> stateside for the first time for the latest iteration of the electric Nissan Leaf. ProPilot Assist, as it&apos;s known in its current form, serves as an autonomous, single-lane highway driving system. But Nissan&apos;s long-term plans for ProPilot, as displayed in the IMx concept, go far beyond that base-level functionality.</p><p>"At the core of the IMx&apos;s technological features is a future version of ProPilot that offers fully autonomous operation," writes Nissan. "When ProPilot drive mode is selected, the system stows the steering wheel inside the dashboard and reclines all seats, giving the driver more space and allowing the vehicle&apos;s occupants to relax and enjoy their commute. When manual drive mode is selected, the vehicle returns the steering wheel and seats to their original position, seamlessly transferring control back to the driver."</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7VaRWZFz7c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>A video that Nissan released shows a driver/passenger taking a phone call that shows up on his vehicle&apos;s dashboard. The car is able to connect to surrounding vehicles in a demonstration of its V2V technology and then drops the person inside off at the airport before driving human-free to park itself. And that is when things get interesting.</p><p>"The IMx can park itself in a spot where the vehicle can connect to the local power grid and act as a &apos;virtual&apos; power plant by returning electricity to the grid, an extension of its vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-building features," according to Nissan. "Once the owner returns, the IMx can pick them up at the terminal and drive home."</p><p>Nissan is already beginning to test vehicle-to-grid technology <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40476527/these-new-electric-cars-will-pay-for-their-charging-by-selling-energy-back-to-the-grid" target="new">in Europe</a>.</p><p>As some of the capabilities that automakers teased at auto shows in decades past start to come online, it will be interesting to see what kind of moonshots future concept cars try to tackle.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Nissan Reveals Electric Autonomous Crossover Concept' --post_excerpt='Nissan unveiled an ambitious prototype vehicle at the Tokyo Motor Show.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Nissan Reveals Electric Autonomous Crossover Concept' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-11-07 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-11-07 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,4,6,8,9" --tags_input='Nissan, autonomous vehicle, concept car, self-driving car, IMx, ProPilot' --tax_input=''

One ill-advised turn of the steering wheel could result in a car careening off the road.</p><p>With the exception of white knuckles, self-driving cars face very similar struggles as humans in these conditions. Their sensors are vulnerable to being impaired just like human eyes, and the process of teaching autonomous vehicle computers to adjust their driving technique for icy roads is complicated by the large number of unpredictable variables that a vehicle encounters from second to second.</p><p>Since a lot of testing of self-driving cars takes place in regions of the western US where snow isn&apos;t a common occurrence, it can be tough for developers to build vehicles that are able to perform in winter conditions.</p><p>That is why Waymo is building its operations in a part of the country where the weather is considerably less hospitable during the winter months.</p><p>In a Medium post titled "Michigan is Waymo&apos;s winter wonderland," Waymo CEO John Krafcik outlined how the Alphabet company is taking its self-driving cars to the Wolverine State for testing in the snow.</p><p>"Now, just in time for the first snowfall of the season, Waymo self-driving cars will hit Michigan roads for the winter," Krafcik <a href="https://medium.com/waymo/michigan-is-waymos-winter-wonderland-9b3cffbb9bab" target="new">writes</a>. "Building on the snowy work we&apos;ve done to date, we&apos;ll be giving our vehicles even more practice driving in snow, sleet and ice. This type of testing will give us the opportunity to assess the way our sensors perform in wet, cold conditions. And it will also build on the advanced driving skills we&apos;ve developed over the last eight years by teaching our cars how to handle things like skidding on icy, unplowed roads."</p><p>As Krafcik references, this isn&apos;t the company&apos;s first time testing its cars in wintry conditions.</p><p>"Making snow angels in Tahoe!," the company wrote in a tweet this past March, which included a photograph of a Waymo van in a snowy parking lot. "We&apos;re testing our self-driving Pacificas in cold weather and collecting snow data to train our software." The company&apos;s testing in Michigan will build upon the learning gained in Lake Tahoe.</p><p>Waymo is not new to Michigan, either.</p><p>In May 2016, the company opened a 53,000 sq ft development center in Novi to "more easily collaborate with our Michigan partners," Krafcik wrote. Waymo has a large fleet of Pacifica minivans that are produced by Chrysler, which is headquartered in nearby Auburn Hills. But as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552598/waymo-michigan-self-driving-car-test" target="new">The Verge</a> points out, the Waymo move is still likely to cause waves:</p><p>"The arrival of Waymo&apos;s autonomous vehicles may, however, send a shiver up the spine of Detroit&apos;s Big Three: Ford, GM, and Fiat-Chrysler. Last January, the company took the stage at the North American International Auto Show to unveil for the first time its self-driving minivans. So it was probably only a matter of time before the company began testing in Detroit too."</p><p>Obviously, Waymo has been on the radar of these companies since its origins as a secretive division of Google.

It comes from having a suite of sensors that include Lidar, radar, and cameras all working in concert to help a car understand its surroundings. But a diverse group of sensors isn&apos;t enough: Self-driving cars need even more tools to build awareness.</p><p>Chief among those is three-dimensional, high-definition mapping. Having a digital map for reference gives an autonomous vehicle&apos;s operating system an idea of what&apos;s ahead, baseline knowledge that substantially eases the burden on a vehicle&apos;s sensors.</p><p>The self-driving car world got another reminder of just how essential digital mapping is in late October, when tech giant and prominent AV developer <a href="http://apollo.auto/" target="new">Baidu</a> struck up a partnership with fellow Chinese company Shouqi Limousine and Chauffeur to speed its development of maps for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>The partnership with the ride-hailing company is part of Baidu&apos;s effort to get self-driving cars on the road as soon as possible, according to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/29/baidu-partners-with-ride-hailing-service-on-self-driving-cars/" target="new">Engadget</a>.</p><p>"It&apos;s no secret as to why Baidu is signing a deal like this: it&apos;s making a big bet on self-driving technology, and it doesn&apos;t have much time to fulfill some of its promises," Engadget&apos;s Jon Fingas writes. "A transportation firm like Shouqi is effectively a shortcut: it already has the kind of real-world map data that would take Baidu months or years to collect."</p><p>The company&apos;s urgency is understandable.</p><p>Baidu hasn&apos;t been shy about its ambitious goals for self-driving cars. Earlier in October, CEO Robin Li told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/baidu-sees-ai-as-key-to-its-future-1508811541" target="new">Wall Street Journal</a> that Baidu had plans to partner with another Chinese company to pilot a fully self-driving bus beginning in 2018. Also in October, Baidu announced a partnership with Chinese automaker BAIC group to manufacture autonomous vehicles by 2021. Li is quick to point out that Baidu isn&apos;t building these cars on its own.</p><p>"We only touch the software part," Li said. "We don&apos;t manufacture the cars ... We provide the technology."</p><p>The most prominent aspect of that technology is Apollo, Baidu&apos;s open autonomous platform that currently has over 70 partners, including high-profile autonomous players like Intel, Nvidia, Velodyne and Ford. In September, Baidu announced the latest iteration of the platform: Apollo 1.5.</p><p>"The cloud simulation system on Apollo is the only platform that provides open, built-in HD maps tailored for autonomous driving," the company <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">said</a> of the update. "Based on large-scale cloud computing capacity, Apollo has a vast amount of real traffic data in China, and has a virtual running capacity of one million kilometers per day."</p><p>Baidu hopes that data, combined with Shouqui&apos;s maps, will help the company deploy many different forms of autonomous vehicles in the near future and become Asia&apos;s AV leader. </p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Baidu, Shouqui Want to Accelerate Driverless Car Development' --post_excerpt='Chinese tech giant Baidu takes another step toward its autonomous vehicle goals.

Hall is an inventor first and foremost and his background is unique in the tech industry. The story is worth reading in full, but here are three key takeaways about Hall and the company that made him a billionaire.</p><p><strong>1. Velodyne started out making speakers</strong></p><p>Velodyne didn&apos;t start out making sensors for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Its first product was a speaker, the ULD-18, that was released in 1988 and became a hit with critics and consumers.</p><p>"As I heard the solid, gut-punching bass note, I felt the wood floor flex under my feet! The impact of the floor shock reminded me of the shift caused by a Richter 4.5 earthquake," wrote a critic for Stereophile. <a href="http://velodyneacoustics.com/" target="new">Velodyne Acoustics</a> continues to make high quality speakers that are prized by audiophiles. It was only last year that Velodyne&apos;s Lidar operations were spun off into a separate company.</p><p><strong>2. Hall revolutionized Lidar design</strong></p><p>In autonomous vehicle circles, there is a certain lore around the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, an autonomous vehicle competition sponsored by a division of the US Department of Defense.</p><p>The 2005 event hosted many participants that went on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/cmu-solves-12-year-old-darpa-grand-challenge-mystery" target="new">to become</a> pioneers and leaders in the world of autonomous vehicles. Hall&apos;s team didn&apos;t win the challenge, but it did make waves with a first-of-its-kind rotating Lidar design. The sensor&apos;s software allowed a vehicle to construct a three-dimensional, 360-degree map of its environment.</p><p>"It was a groundbreaking design, one that Hall patented in 2007, that meant you could not only see and avoid obstacles, you could localize yourself on a real-time map, allowing for navigation, even if you lost GPS," writes Popper.</p><p><strong>3. Velodyne has its eyes on more than cars</strong></p><p>Late last year, Velodyne announced a new product called the Velarray. It&apos;s a solid-state Lidar, meaning it doesn&apos;t rotate, and will supposedly cost a mere $50. That&apos;s a price point that will be nothing short of game-changing if the sensor is up to the task of powering a self-driving car. And according to Hall, it will do even more than that.</p><p>"When we get the cost down these will be in everything," he told The Verge. "Forklifts, golf carts, anything that can run into something else."</p><p>Hall&apos;s career story is a fascinating one.

The pulses bounce off of surrounding objects and return to the sensor, giving a vehicle accurate measurements of how far away it is from those objects.</p><p>That data can then be used to create a virtual, three-dimensional map of an autonomous vehicle&apos;s immediate surroundings, allowing it to navigate the road safely and respond quickly to changing circumstances.</p><p>Lidar was once known for its coffee can-shaped housing device, but has taken a variety of different shapes in recent years. Along with this changing form has come improved function: The Lidar systems on the market offer increased range and clarity with each year.</p><p>Having affordable, high-performing Lidar has long been an imperative for self-driving car designers, but it becomes even more essential as these outfits start scaling up the production of autonomous vehicles in the coming years.</p><p>To make sure that they have access to high quality Lidar, OEMs have taken to acquiring Lidar companies and bringing their operations in house.

Its <a href="https://www.princetonlightwave.com/products/geigercruizer/" target="new">GeigerCruizer Lidar</a> can detect objects more than 300 meters away and can still operate in snow and foggy conditions as well as when water or dirt lands on the Lidar&apos;s window.</p><p>Argo AI isn&apos;t the first company to make a splash with a key Lidar acquisition in recent weeks. Earlier in October, GM&apos;s Cruise Automation <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">purchased</a> Lidar startup Strobe, and Delphi Automotive forged a <a href="http://investor.delphi.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Delphi-Partners-with-LeddarTech-to-Provide-LiDAR-for-Autonomous-Vehicles/default.aspx" target="new">partnership</a> with Lidar company LeddarTech.

The company has partnerships with a number of AV initiatives, and that list of partners grew longer in late October when GoMentum announced news of a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.tri.global/" target="_new">Toyota Research Institute</a> (TRI).</p><p>"The benefits of driverless technology are many, but the most important one is increased safety.

"The statistics are clear: lives will be saved by reducing a vehicle&apos;s reliance on human drivers, and we are excited to see the progress TRI will make to perfect driverless and driver-aided technology at GoMentum Station."</p><p>A subsidiary of Toyota North America, the Toyota Research Institute was founded in 2015 to pursue advancements ranging from vehicular safety to vehicular autonomy. Part of that pursuit involves investing in outside entities. In July, TRI announced it had invested $5 million in the <a href="http://www.acmwillowrun.org/" target="new">American Center for Mobility</a>, a Michigan AV facility not unlike GoMentum Station. In announcing the investment, TRI CEO Gill Pratt espoused the value of private driverless test sites.</p><p>"As we move forward with the development of autonomous cars, we must remember that not all test miles are created equal," Pratt <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">said</a>. "The road to creating a car as safe, or safer, than a human driver will require billions of test miles including simulation, real-world driving on public roads, and closed-course testing where we can expose our systems to extreme circumstances and conditions."</p><p>At GoMentum Station, TRI will test two different versions of its autonomous technology, which go by the names of Guardian and Chauffeur. The first refers to advanced driver-assistance system technology that features some autonomous aspects. The second refers to the operations of a fully self-driving car.</p><p>"The addition of GoMentum Station to TRI&apos;s arsenal of automated vehicle test locations allows us to create hazardous driving scenarios for advancing capabilities of both Guardian and Chauffeur and further develop our technology," said TRI VP of autonomous driving Ryan Eustice.</p><p>While the miles of testing that AVs get on public roads are invaluable, closed courses allow for an economy of testing in which developers can repeatedly present autonomous systems with rare, challenging situations that they might not run into otherwise.

He has written numerous articles for the <i>New Yorker</i>, immensely popular books like <i>Blink</i>, <i>Outliers</i> and the <i>Tipping Point</i>, and most recently began hosting the <i>Revisionist History</i> podcast.

He compares the possible implications of AV technology to those of smartphones, which have come to partially replace face to-face social interaction in the lives of young people.</p><p>"It wasn&apos;t Audi, Ford, or GM that pushed hardest for the dependent vehicle. It was Apple, Google, and Intel, companies for which the automobile is not primarily an aesthetic object and driving is not an instrument of pleasure," Gladwell writes. "And the users they have in mind, needless to say, are not the readers of <i>Car and Driver</i>. They are the kids lying passively on the couch with their smartphones."</p><p>In <i>Car and Driver</i> readers, Gladwell has a sympathetic audience.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>As technology develops, new automobile safety features make their way into the market. After all, consumers want the safest car possible, and have demonstrated a willingness to pay for those benefits.</p><p>But that is not the only incentive that drives automakers.</p><p>Designed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) have long compelled automakers by law to include certain safety features in their vehicles. Established in 1966, the FMVSS established many of the requirements that we now take for granted, including seat belts (1967), air bags (1984) and tire pressure monitoring systems (2005).</p><p>Late in 2016, the Obama administration proposed making another feature required for all newly manufactured vehicles: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology. V2V is commonly referred to as the tech that allows cars to "talk" to one another, enabling them to individually and collectively be much safer on the roads. The proposal would have required that half of all new vehicles come equipped with the technology within two years, and that V2V be part of all new vehicles within four years.</p><p>Now, however, the proposed mandate may not come to fruition, according to the AP.</p><p>"The administration has decided not to pursue a final V2V mandate, said two auto industry officials who have spoken with White House and Transportation Department officials and two others whose organizations have spoken to the administration," <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2017-11-01/ap-newsbreak-govt-wont-pursue-talking-car-mandate" target="new">reported</a> Joan Lowy. "The industry officials spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize their relations with the administration.</p><p>In the days after the report was published, the DoT denied that it had made a final decision on the matter. They did not, however, state any specific intent to pursue the mandate.</p><p>"The Department of Transportation and NHTSA have not made any final decision on the proposed rulemaking concerning a V2V mandate. Any reports to the contrary are mistaken," the NHTSA <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/trump-administration-reportedly-kills-vehicle-to-vehicle-safety-mandate/" target="new">told</a> Ars Technica. "In all events, DOT hopes to use the dedicated [radio] spectrum for transportation lifesaving technologies. Safety is the Department&apos;s number one priority."</p><p>To those who have followed the issue closely, the news that the V2V mandate is facing serious resistance will not come as a surprise.</p><p>In April, Automotive News published an extensive report detailing the opposition to the change. No one seems to take issue with the technology itself. Even those opposed to the mandate preface their criticism with support of V2V. The concerns tend to be more ideological and business-oriented. There are free-market proponents who are against government regulation in general, and V2V entrepreneurs who believe their ventures would be put at a disadvantage by the proposed law. </p><p>"I would totally understand if NHTSA said, &apos;We&apos;re interested in safety and we want these safety features,&apos;" Eran Shir, CEO of V2V company <a href="https://www.getnexar.com/" target="new">Nexar</a>, <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170417/OEM06/170419865/federal-v2v-mandate-meets-growing-resistance" target="new">told</a> Automotive News. "There are millions of lives at stake. What I think is less reasonable is if NHTSA comes and says we want to regulate the technology. That doesn&apos;t make sense."</p><p>Due to its interconnected nature, V2V functionality becomes more effective with each additional vehicle that participates in the network. While some cars on the road are already equipped, and many more will be so in the coming years regardless of what the government does, the lack of a mandate could slow the establishment of a truly connected roadway.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Federal V2V Mandate Now in Doubt' --post_excerpt='A vehicle-to-vehicle regulatory measure from the Obama administration may not become law after all.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Federal V2V Mandate Now in Doubt' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-11-14 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-11-14 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,5,6,8,9" --tags_input='V2V, vehicle to vehicle, technology, connected car, autonomous car, auto safety' --tax_input=''

Plus, the knowledge that self-driving cars are already testing on public roadways generates public excitement and anticipation.</p><p>But while they may get less attention, private testing facilities are just as important in the development of autonomous vehicles.</P><p>Every self-driving car you see testing on the roads is the product of countless hours of testing in a private setting. And there&apos;s no expiration date on their usefulness: The automotive innovations of tomorrow are being tested on closed courses right now.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, one of the nation&apos;s most forward-thinking states when it comes to autonomous vehicles -- Michigan -- is home to one of the best closed-course AV testing facilities, <a href="https://mcity.umich.edu/our-work/mcity-test-facility/" target="new">Mcity</a>.</p><p>Located on the University of Michigan&apos;s North Campus in Ann Arbor, the 32-acre site represents a public-private initiative for the research and development of self-driving cars. And in late October, the project received $11 million in a second round of industry funding that will help Mcity continue to be one of the nation&apos;s premier autonomous testing facilities.</p><p>"Mcity has quickly risen to be one of Michigan&apos;s strongest assets and a national leader in autonomous vehicle research and development," <a href="http://www.ns.umich.edu/new/releases/25206-industry-partners-invest-in-second-phase-of-mcity-funding" target="new">said</a> Michigan Governor Rick Snyder. "The state of Michigan clearly sees the value in having the facility and research in our mobility ecosystem, but the private sector is continuing to show support and interest in the advancements that come from the facility, as well. I congratulate Mcity on their continued partnerships and outstanding success."</p><p>Of all of the AV accomplishments that have taken place at Mcity, its very existence surely ranks among the most impressive and encouraging.</p><p>The facility exists as a joint effort between the University of Michigan and the state department of transportation, as well as a long list of companies that are ostensibly competitors. Eleven companies spanning a range of automotive sectors contributed to this latest round of funding, including Delphi Automotive, GM, Intel, LG Electronic and State Farm.</p><p>"Launching Mcity was in itself a grand experiment," noted Mcity director Huei Peng. "How might companies representing such a broad range of industries, including many who compete with each other, be able to effectively work together? The experiment has proven to be a very successful model where these companies have been able to work collaboratively and productively to explore questions about connected and automated vehicles that no single company or industry can address alone."</p><p>While much of the research at Mcity involves the direct development of autonomous driving technology, a good amount of it also considers larger questions about the implementation of self-driving cars on our roads, as well as more niche issues that will impact our AV future. The facility&apos;s projects <a href="https://mcity.umich.edu/our-work/research/" target="new">include</a> "Explanations and Expectations: Trust Building in Autonomous Vehicles," "The Driver in the Driverless Car," and "Fuel Economy Optimization of Heavy-duty Vehicles using Connected Vehicle Technology."</p><p>The total investment in Mcity and the school&apos;s <a href="http://www.umtri.umich.edu/" target="new">Transportation Research Institute</a> will reach $100 million by 2020, according to the university.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>There are more than a few reasons why owning an electric car is desirable.</p><p>In a world where climate change is a constant concern, owning a vehicle that lowers one&apos;s carbon footprint feels like a moral imperative to some. With ten times fewer moving parts than a gas-powered car, EVs also typically require far less maintenance. And that&apos;s just one way that they can save owners money. Running a car on electricity is, simply put, less expensive than running a car on gasoline.</p><p>This is especially true in times of energy insecurity, which impacts gas prices far more than electricity.</p><p>So why haven&apos;t electric cars fully caught on among consumers yet?</p><p>One of the biggest reasons is the widespread belief that the current infrastructure in place for electric vehicle charging is insufficient.</p><p>A fully charged car battery can only take a driver so far, and car owners need to know that they can find a charging station within a reasonable distance when they need to plug in their car. With the prevalence of gas stations, the prospect of a car running out of fuel is far less daunting than a car running out of battery power, when the nearest charging station could be 100-plus miles away.</p><p>In recent years, public and private entities have commenced efforts to ease these concerns and establish a reliable and widespread infrastructure for charging EVs. Europe has been especially active. In November, a partnership or primarily German automakers announced a collaborative effort to install 400 "ultra-fast" vehicle charging stations across Europe by 2020, with the installations beginning this year.</p><p>"Ionity, a joint venture of BMW AG, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen with its Audi and Porsche brands, plans to open 20 stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria," Reuters <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-electricity-autos-charging/carmakers-plan-400-europe-car-charging-stations-by-2020-idUKKBN1D30YE" target="new">reported</a>. "They will be 120 km (75 miles) apart and run in partnership with Tank & Rast, Circle K and OMV."</p><p>As a product of high-profile partners, the power and influence behind Ionity cannot be overstated. (As <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ionity-is-european-for-big-ass-ev-charging-network/" target="new">CNET</a> hilariously put it, "Ionity is European for &apos;big-ass&apos; EV charging network.") BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen each hold equal shares in the company, although the possibility remains that more automakers could join the venture. The chargers they plan to offer are no joke. At 350 kW per charging point, the Ionity chargers will be three times as powerful as Tesla Superchargers.</p><p>"The launch of Ionity represents a breakthrough in the move towards a comprehensive rapid charging infrastructure in Europe," Oliver Blume, chairman of Porsche&apos;s executive board, wrote in a <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/company/porsche-ionity-europe-high-power-charging-network-joint-venture-electromobility-14439.html" target="new">statement</a>. "Creating a functioning charging infrastructure is necessary for ensuring electromobility is accepted and further expanded. With the rapid charging network from Ionity, we are ensuring that our customers can use electric cars on long journeys without compromising on convenience."</p><p>The Ionity launch comes amidst a spate of announcements of EV initiatives in Europe. Mitsubishi recently announced that it had joined with a series of partners to introduce V2G technology in the Netherlands, which will enable electric cars to return electricity to the grid for the first time.</p><p>"With V2G-technology, we turn parked electric vehicles -- at home and at work -- into power service providers and energy buffers," <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">said</a> Sytse Zuidema, CEO of NewMotion, one of Mitsubishi&apos;s partners in the initiative. "They can save a surplus of energy and return energy to the grid at a peak time. This results in more stability and security."</p><p>Clearly, the EV space is one that is seeing a lot of action right now, especially in Europe. With businesses taking the lead, it will be interesting to see if consumers soon follow.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='400 EV Charging Stations Coming to Europe by 2020' --post_excerpt='German automakers are teaming up to make EV ownership a better experience.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='400 EV Charging Stations Coming to Europe by 2020' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-11-15 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-11-15 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,8,9" --tags_input='Ionity, electric vehicles, EVs, BMW, Daimler, Ford, Volkswagen, Tesla Supercharger' --tax_input=''

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>It has been a long time since BlackBerry made the best-known smartphones on the market.</p><p>In the days before touchscreens, music streaming, and FaceTime, BlackBerry devices became nearly ubiquitous among business professionals who used them to send emails or browse the web. The physical QWERTY keyboard of the BlackBerry was a major advancement over the chocolate bar or clamshell-shaped cell phones that had dominated up until that point. You&apos;d be hard-pressed to find someone staring down at a BlackBerry device these days.</p><p>The company has since ceded the smartphone market to Apple and Samsung, but Blackberry, which now defines itself as "a mobile-native security software and services company dedicated to securing the enterprise of things" hasn&apos;t gone away. In fact, it may have found an even more lucrative field to enter: autonomous vehicles.</p><p>A major part of <a href="https://us.blackberry.com/" target="new">BlackBerry</a>&apos;s current business is its QNX Software Systems, a network of various connectivity-enabling operating systems that the company acquired from Harman in 2010.</p><p>One of the primary applications for QNX systems is connected cars.</p><p>And, according to a recent report by David George-Cosh for the Wall Street Journal, <a href="http://www.jaguarlandrover.com/" target="new">Jaguar Land Rover</a> is eyeing a deal with BlackBerry to use QNX to enable self-driving cars, as well.</p><p>"A potential deal between the two companies would give JLR access to the Canadian company&apos;s QNX software suite, which would be used to securely handle the computing power needed to run driverless vehicles," George-Cosh <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/11/03/blackberry-in-talks-with-tata-motors-jaguar-land-rover-for-software-deal-update.html" target="_blank">writes</a>. "BlackBerry&apos;s QNX software is used to securely manage and handle the millions of lines of code that autonomous cars rely upon to analyze a complex system of sensors to avoid hitting other vehicles, read traffic signals, and assess road conditions. The company doesn&apos;t write the code used by driverless cars but mainly acts as an operating system that connects various components, much like how applications run on Microsoft Corp.&apos;s Windows."</p><p>Such an arrangement with Jaguar Land Rover would be the second such deal for BlackBerry, which has had a deal with Ford since 2014, when the automaker decided to use QNX to power its Sync 3 infotainment system. The two companies expanded the scope of their agreement last October to encompass all aspects of Ford&apos;s connected cars.</p><p>"With the success of our Sync 3 system globally, which is based on the BlackBerry QNX operating system, we understand the importance of the connected car experience to our customers," Ford CTO Raj Nair <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/blackberry-signs-agreement-with-ford-motor-company-expanded-use-blackberrys-qnx-security-nasdaq-bbry-2171230.htm" target="new">noted</a> at the time. "Growing our expertise, experience and use of the BlackBerry QNX embedded software platforms will help ensure we deliver the high-quality, highly secure experience that our customers expect."</p><p>It&apos;s uncertain how exactly Blackberry&apos;s QNX could be deployed to assist in vehicular autonomy with Jaguar Land Rover. But if the deal gets done it would be another sign that Blackberry is emerging as a power in the autonomous vehicle space, which is all the more impressive considering the scope and size of the pivot the company needed to undertake in order to reach this point.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Jaguar Land Rover Reportedly Talking With Blackberry for Software Development ' --post_excerpt='Jaguar Land Rover would gain access to BlackBerry&apos;s broad QNX AV platform.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Jaguar Land Rover Reportedly Talking With Blackberry for Software Development ' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-11-17 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-11-17 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,8,9" --tags_input='Blackberry, Jaguar Land Rover, QNX, connected car, self-driving, autonomous vehicle, driverless' --tax_input=''

Her resulting book became a best-seller in its own right. In the 1920&apos;s, Aloha Wanderwell&apos;s seven-year adventure around the globe by car earned her the nicknames "The World&apos;s Most Widely Traveled Girl" and "The Amelia Earhart of the Automobile."</p><p>In the late 1980s, comedian Michael Palin filmed a television special for BBC in which he traveled around the world in 80 days -- without using any aircrafts. </p><p>It&apos;s probably for the best that artificial intelligence systems haven&apos;t yet developed to a point where they harbor their own travel dreams. But it shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise that human developers of autonomous vehicles want to test their projects on across the globe.</p><p>The reasons extend beyond a healthy sense of adventure.

The density of traffic in Chinese cities is overwhelming for most human drivers who aren&apos;t from the region, and markings on Chinese road signs can bear striking similarities to American ones that have distinctly different meanings. Needless to say, it takes more than a software tweak or two to translate self-driving systems from one country to another.</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s not a given that all countries will be as accepting to self-driving cars as countries like Germany, the United States, and England have been thus far. With this in mind, the Intelligent World Drive seems to be just as much of a diplomatic mission as it is an information-gathering one.</p><p>"Progress must not stop at national borders. Legislation must keep pace with technological development. Otherwise it will not be possible for important innovations in automated and autonomous driving to hit the road," noted Daimler board member Renata Jungo Brungger. "Legal certainty is essential for the acceptance of autonomous driving in society.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Tens of thousands of Americans die every year in car accidents. It&apos;s a horrific reality, but one that has become normalized.</p><p>With the exception of drunk driving and texting while driving, seldom do you see campaigns that raise awareness about general traffic accidents and the deaths that arise from them.</p><p>One of the biggest benefits of self-driving cars is the potential to dramatically reduce the number of traffic fatalities. One projection states that, in the fully autonomous future, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/self-driving-cars-could-save-300000-lives-per-decade-in-america/407956/" target="new">on-road deaths will be reduced by 90%</a>. The question is about what should be done in the interim, when self-driving cars share the road with human drivers and the illogical ways they can behave.</p><p>Even though many of the self-driving cars that are already in testing seem to be safer than the average human driver, there is still a lot of hesitation about rolling them out <i>en masse</i>. One hurdle is confronting the amount of negative attention that will be generated when an AV crashes. Hand-wringing about a crash caused by a self-driving car could set back self-driving cars tremendously.</p><p>The negative impact can even be seen in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/09/self-driving-shuttle-in-las-vegas-got-into-an-accident-on-its-first-day.html" target="new">recent accident</a> involving an autonomous shuttle in Las Vegas.</P><p>The shuttle was operating on its first day when a truck driver started backing a vehicle towards the shuttle. The shuttle did what it was supposed to do and stopped, but the truck driver did not notice the shuttle and backed into its bumper. Even though the accident was entirely the fault of the human truck driver, most headlines about the incident focused solely on the autonomous shuttle. One can imagine the negative PR storm for an incident with graver consequences. </p><p>With these issues in mind, the question of when and how lawmakers should allow autonomous vehicles on our roads is a challenging one, and appears to be a sort of balancing act. Introducing imperfect AVs immediately could risk alienating consumers, but waiting until autonomous vehicles are "perfect" would leave the issue of road death rates unaddressed.</p><p>The RAND Corporation addressed this scenario in a recent study called "The Enemy of the Good: Estimating the Cost of Waiting for Nearly Perfect Automated Vehicles."</p><p>In the report, authors Nidhi Kalra and David G. Groves compared the costs and benefits of three hypothetical realities: Allowing AVs on the road when they&apos;re 10% better than human drivers (Improve10), allowing them on the road when they&apos;re 75% better than human drivers (Improve75), and allowing 90% better (Improve90). The results validated those who favor getting them on our streets as soon as possible.</p><p>"We find that, in the short term, more lives are cumulatively saved under a more permissive policy (Improve10) than stricter policies requiring greater safety advancements (Improve75 or Improve90) in nearly all conditions, and those savings can be significant--hundreds of thousands of lives," Kalra and Groves write in a <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2150.html" target="new">summary</a> of their findings. "In the long term, more lives are cumulatively saved under an Improve10 policy than either Improve75 or Improve90 policies under all combinations of conditions we explored. In many cases, those savings can be more than half a million lives."</p><p>One reason behind the researchers&apos; findings is the belief that it could be a very long time before self-driving cars are 75% to 90% safer than human drivers.</p><p>While the leading AV developers appear to have designed operating systems that can process and handle 99% of on-road situations, it&apos;s that remaining 1% -- the unexpected, crazy and the abnormal -- that can throw cars for a loop. These happen to be the scenarios that are most likely to lead to accidents, for AVs and humans alike. Many experts consider Level 5 autonomy to be an idea that will only exist theoretically in the near future. So just how close are today&apos;s cars to hitting the RAND Corporation&apos;s "Improve10" numbers? It varies, but generally speaking they may not be as close as you might believe, according to Aarian Marshall at Wired.</p><p>"The 43 companies testing self-driving cars in California must submit public &apos;disengagement reports,&apos; noting every time a human driver intervenes while behind the wheel of a self-driving car," Marshall <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-cars-rand-report/" target="new">writes</a>. "Last year&apos;s reports show these cars are getting better, but aren&apos;t all the way there: Waymo&apos;s cars averaged 5,128 miles between disengagements -- pretty good! -- while Mercedes-Benz did 1.8 -- not so great. Today, autonomous vehicles are about as good as a standard crappy driver."</p><p>Typically, AV designers are the first to acknowledge that their products are far from perfect. But their work is driven by the strong belief that, one day, their work will help save thousands of lives every year. If Kalra and Groves are to be believed, that day ought to come sooner than later.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Why Self-Driving Cars Crash in Order to Save Lives' --post_excerpt='A RAND Corporation study suggests that introducing AVs to the road sooner rather than later -- even if they&apos;re imperfect -- could prevent many deaths.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Why Self-Driving Cars Crash in Order to Save Lives' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-11-20 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-11-20 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='RAND corporation, autonomous vehicles, AVs, self-driving cars, driverless, traffic accidents, traffic deaths' --tax_input=''
wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Even without autonomous vehicles figuring into the equation, the use of ride-hailing services has skyrocketed in recent years.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, people find it incredibly convenient and appealing to order a ride on demand from the palm of their hands. (Well, from a device in the palm of their hands. We haven&apos;t reached the point of skin-as-touchscreen -- yet.)</p><p>For many, especially those in urban areas, ride-hailing has become a viable alternative to car ownership. The time and money saved by not worrying about parking, insurance or maintenance -- not to mention actually purchasing a vehicle -- can make all the difference.</p><p>Studies have also shown that young people are less interested in owning cars -- or even just driving -- than previous generations.</p><p>For now, you still see a picture of a human driver while waiting for an Uber or Lyft to arrive. But self-driving fleets look set to play an increasingly large role in ride-sharing.</p><p>Many predict this development will fundamentally shift how we get around.</p><p>Without human drivers involved, the availability of rides will increase and the waiting time and costs for rides will decrease.</p><p>French company Navya took another step toward that future on November 7, when it introduced a fully autonomous robotaxi called Autonom Cab at a private event in Paris.</p><p>"Imagine what cities would be like if there were nothing but Autonoms running on the road.

"At Navya, we recognize that the status of individual cars is rapidly changing, especially among younger generations, many of whom don&apos;t have their driver&apos;s license and are less attached to the concept of owning a car. What they want are mobility solutions available 24/7, ensuring their safety and well-being at a reduced cost. Autonom Cab is leading edge and will revolutionize both habits and technology, enabling a great many people to gain access to a brand-new mobility solution."</p><p>Navya isn&apos;t the first company to introduce such a product --Waymo, Cruise Automation and Uber have all announced similar initiatives in recent months that will remove human operators from the driver&apos;s seat.</p><p>Navya&apos;s Autonom Cab, however, stands out in a major way: It doesn&apos;t <em>have</em> a driver&apos;s seat. In fact, there&apos;s no cockpit at all, with no steering wheel or pedals. Similar prototypes have eliminated these features before, but none have been this far along in development and close to hitting the road.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4ABVE2m1BQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The Autonom Cab&apos;s predecessor, the Autonom Shuttle, is already being deployed. These fully electric, self-driving shuttle buses are carrying passengers in Las Vegas, Michigan and Singapore. Their introduction has not been without incident. An Autonom Shuttle was involved in a minor fender bender mere hours after Las Vegas officials celebrated its launch in the city. The shuttle, however, was not at fault.</p><p>"The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that its sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped to avoid the accident," the City of Las Vegas noted in a <a href="http://cityoflasvegas.tumblr.com/post/167279971383/update-minor-incident-downtown-wednesday" target="new">statement</a>. "Unfortunately the delivery truck did not stop and grazed the front fender of the shuttle. Had the truck had the same sensing equipment that the shuttle has the accident would have been avoided."</p><p>The new Autonom Cab will be able to hold up to six passengers. It will be equipped with three 360-degree Lidars, seven 145-degree lidars, six cameras and will be V2X enabled.

The stations will be placed every 400 miles, a number built to accommodate the vehicles&apos; battery power and the amount of time a human driver can drive before they ought to stop for rest.</p><p>"The reason 400 miles is important is you have to take a break eventually," Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/38529-tesla-semi-truck-elon-musk" target="new">said</a> at the unveiling. "If you drive for five or six hours, that&apos;s about as much as you want to be driving continuously."</p><p>The Semi&apos;s cockpit will feature dual touchscreens for drivers to keep track of vehicle diagnostics and utilize advanced driver assistance systems. More revolutionary, though, is Tesla&apos;s placement of the driver&apos;s seat at the center of the truck, as opposed to the left side. Passenger seats will be placed behind the driver&apos;s seat.</p><p>"You&apos;re positioned like you&apos;re in a race car," Musk said. "You have complete visibility of the road and all your surroundings ... I can drive this thing and I have no idea how to drive a semi."</p><p>Tesla did not reveal how much the new truck would cost. With its leading edge electric drive train and impressive performance specs, the Semi certainly won&apos;t be cheap. But fleet companies are already signing on. <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171117005116/en/J.B.-Hunt-Transport-Services-Reserves-Tesla-Trucks" target="_blank">J.B. Hunt Transport Services</a> announced it would buy multiple vehicles for use on the west coast of the US and Walmart said it planned to order 15 Tesla Semis, five to be used in the US and ten for Canada.</p><p>While the upfront costs are set to be higher, Tesla estimates that the fuel savings could top $200,000 compared with diesel semis.

With the introduction of the connected car, however, a new set of parts are emerging as fundamental components of the automobile of tomorrow. While this hardware may be essential for cars already on the road, much of it will become required for newly manufactured vehicles going forward.</p><p>For connected cars, the single piece of technology that is most vital to their connective components is the communication chip. Already a significant market, the production of modem chips is set to explode in the coming years. As semiconductor analyst Tristan Gerra told Reuters, in the current automotive landscape, only 12 million of the 90 million cars manufactured annually come equipped with Internet connectivity.

Because of the size of the two companies, a merger would potentially impact an overwhelming majority of the world&apos;s smartphones.</p><p>But as important as the takeover news is for smartphones, it could cause even bigger waves in the automotive world. A merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm would instantly create an outsize player in connected car chip manufacturing.</p><p>For now, the deal remains at a standstill as Qualcomm has rejected the offer but Broadcom&apos;s management remains determined and bidding their time. (See {doclink 738135}.)</p><p>Qualcomm is itself in the midst of acquiring NXP, a Dutch global semiconductor company that makes chips for automotive infotainment and camera systems. Reuters reported that Egil Juliussen, an analyst at IHSMarkit, says that if the three companies became one, it would be a "formidable competitor in the automotive chip space." Juliussen sees "Intel and Nvidia Corp, which make both make the main processors used in self-driving vehicles, as leaders in the young market, but a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm-NXP would be a strong third-place."</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s $38 billion deal for NXP was approved with conditions by the US Justice Department, but the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nxp-semicondtrs-m-a-qualcomm-eu/qualcomm-nxp-ruling-may-be-in-2018-eu-competition-commissioner-idUSKBN1DF1K2" target="new">European Commission has voiced concerns</a> and delayed a decision until December. If Qualcomm successfully acquires NXP, and if Broadcom successfully acquires Qualcomm thereafter, the resulting enterprise could be a connected car powerhouse.</p><p>But those are significant "ifs."</p><P>Some experts foresee Broadcom needing to launch a hostile takeover to successfully acquire Qualcomm, meaning it would need to appeal to shareholders directly to replace the company&apos;s board before accepting the offer.

With highly developed artificial intelligence, that car could also "read" road signs and traffic signals and comprehend less explicit contextual elements, to make sure it obeyed the rules of the road.</p><p>In theory, a "blind" vehicle that was fully connected could also travel without incident. If every automobile on the road were equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology, they could "talk" to one another and communicate their position and intentions, giving each car a complete understanding of the ones surrounding it.</p><p>With complete vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology, a central intelligence system could also establish safe, efficient traffic patterns and guide cars accordingly.</p> <p>All of the technology described above exists in some form right now, although it is not in an advanced enough state to be ready for public rollout. But the two distinct categories -- autonomous and connected -- account for the bulk of the work being done in the automotive space right now. And, as Kim Tingley <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/09/magazine/tech-design-autonomous-future-cars-v2v-traffic-peloton.html" target="new">writes</a> in The New York Times Magazine, the two principles are naturally opposed to one another.</p><p>"Ultimately, these two types of systems will have to complement each other, yet neither can be implemented all at once," Tingley writes. "In the meantime, the process of developing and deploying them often puts them at odds. Indeed, the two systems are, in a sense, philosophically opposed: libertarian self-reliance in a race with socialist collectivity to be the first to improve traffic flow."</p><p>Tingley&apos;s feature, "How to Make Cars Cooperate," is one of several that considers the future of automotives in the Times Magazine&apos;s Tech & Design issue. She takes a deep dive on V2V connectivity, a concept with implementation that could be just as society-changing as autonomy, but also one that is far less known and understood. As Tingley points out, the way in which V2V will succeed is opposite to that of autonomy.</p><p>"Automation thrives in the absence of regulation; V2V depends on it," she writes. "Without federal help, however, the upfront cost of connected infrastructure can be prohibitive for small towns and cities."</p><p>Autonomous vehicle manufacturers are getting plenty of help from the feds -- both <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">House</a> and <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Senate</a> bills promoting widespread expansion of AV testing have found overwhelming support this year. Conversely, reports emerged that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/trump-admin-to-reverse-v2v-tech-mandate-report-says/" target="new">plans to set aside</a> a V2V mandate for auto manufacturers that was proposed at the end of the Obama administration.</p><p>Government officials made repeated denials that they had made such a decision in the days following the reports. Regardless, it remains clear that V2V advancement faces an uphill challenge before it becomes widely accepted and adopted in the US.

Vehicles were given six hours to complete a series of tasks without crashing into one another or breaking California traffic laws. In the third and final Challenge, Carnegie Mellon finally took home a victory with a car nicknamed "Boss."</p><p>"It&apos;s racing and, you know, Boss had a little reputation of being aggressive," said Whittaker.

"The tipping point will come when 20 to 30 percent of vehicles are fully autonomous. Countries will look at the accident statistics and figure out that human drivers are causing 99.9% of the accidents."</p><p>As Lutz acknowledges, most believe that autonomous vehicles will be significantly safer than human drivers once they mature.

The problem is the present. Manufacturing EVs at scale without an established customer base has been a money-losing proposition for OEMs thus far, and it remains unclear when we&apos;ll hit a tipping point where the sale of electric vehicles is consistently profitable.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.gm.com/" target="new">GM</a>, company executives believe they&apos;ve finally found their answer to that question.</p><p>In a meeting with investors at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York on November 15, General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced plans for the company to develop a completely new electric vehicle platform to launch in 2021. At least nine models will be developed through the platform, from a compact crossover to an SUV. Most critically, the venture will be a money-maker.</p><p>"We are committed to a future electric vehicle portfolio that will be profitable," Barra said, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-ceo/gm-challenges-tesla-with-promise-of-profitable-electric-cars-idUSKBN1DF272" target="new">Reuters</a>.</p><p>For GM, the key to profitability is a cheaper battery. The battery system that will power the forthcoming platform will be more than 30% cheaper than the one currently installed in the Chevy Bolt, according to Barra. The battery will also also charge faster and provide longer range -- 300 miles between charges compared to the 238 in the Bolt, an increase of more than 25%.</p><p>As Paul Lienert and Nick Carey noted for Reuters, the subject of EV profitability is something of a loaded issue in the automotive industry, particularly because of <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new">Tesla</a>.</p><p>"Her plans represent a direct challenge to money-losing electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc., which is struggling to get its more affordable, high-volume Model 3 launched and recently reported its largest-ever quarterly loss," write Lienert and Carey.</p><p>While Barra&apos;s proclamations are bold, she&apos;s not the kind of leader that talks the talk without walking the walk.</p><p>"General Motors is a different company under Barra," Joann Muller wrote in a profile of the CEO for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2017/05/02/mary-barra-is-running-gm-with-a-tight-fist-and-an-urgent-mission/" target="new">Forbes</a> in May. "Gone are the empty promises and arrogant bluster. With Barra at the helm, there&apos;s a quiet confidence that if GM just sticks to its plan, good will eventually come. It&apos;s a classic case of under-promising and over-delivering, as in the first quarter, when GM soundly beat Wall Street&apos;s expectations with a 33% jump in net income."</p><p>Barra has clearly earned the right to be ambitious at GM, and she&apos;s taking advantage of it. While only 17,000 Bolts have sold so far, the automaker is predicting 1 million annual EV sales by 2026. If it achieves that type of scale, the category has the potential to do more than just eke out a small profit: it could start delivering a significant chunk of revenue to GM&apos;s bottom line.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='GM CEO Determined to Make Electric Vehicles Profitable' --post_excerpt='General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the company would launch a new EV platform in 2021, and promised that it will turn a profit.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='GM CEO Determined to Make Electric Vehicles Profitable' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-11-28 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-11-28 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,8,9" --tags_input='General Motors, GM, Mary Barra, electric vehicles, EV, Tesla' --tax_input=''

Also listed as a form of sensing is an "inertial measuring unit," which would track the vehicle&apos;s movement on rocky terrain and interpret it to best perform future maneuvering.</p><p>For those who enjoy off-roading, the main appeal lies in the human challenge of maneuvering the vehicle. A fully self-driving off-road automobile would take most of the fun out of the activity. A more likely scenario is a semi-autonomous truck that would be able to identify situations where the vehicle could more safely pass without passengers inside. Instead of turning around or taking a different path, drivers could exit the vehicle, watch it maneuver itself over a tough piece of terrain, and then resume driving.</p><p>It&apos;s a niche use case for a consumer-facing autonomous vehicle, but the underlying technology have wide-ranging applications in industry and military contexts, as well.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Ford Files for Autonomous Off-Road Truck Patent' --post_excerpt='Ford could transform off-roading experience with AV software in control, according to a patent application.

It will include one term of online studies followed by two in-person terms at an Infosys training facility in Mysore, India. The face-to-face AV training will have implications that go beyond company bonding, according to David Silver, head of self-driving cars at Udacity.</p><p>"For many years autonomous vehicle development has happened in just a few places: Detroit, Pittsburgh, southern Germany," Silver wrote in a <a href="https://medium.com/udacity/training-self-driving-car-engineers-in-india-deb55b3e66cb" target="new">Medium post</a>. "Recently, we&apos;ve seen autonomous vehicle development expand to Silicon Valley, Japan, Israel, various parts of Europe, Singapore, and beyond. Training autonomous vehicle engineers in India expands the opportunities for students worldwide."</p><p>That philosophy of inclusion is fundamental for Udacity. In September, the company announced a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">partnership with Lyft</a> to offer scholarships for its AV education programs to specific groups that traditionally had been left out of the tech workplace.</p><p>"Technology is not as diverse as we would like, especially around underserved communities, whether it&apos;s by gender, like women, or if it&apos;s by race, for example African-Americans and Hispanic Latino communities, and Native Americans -- all those are below the percentage of the population in terms of representation," Lyft chief strategy officer Raj Kapoor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/udacity-adds-a-new-intro-to-self-driving-cars-nanodegree/" target="new">told TechCrunch</a>. "And so we felt like, is there a way to get some of those people attracted into this, why don&apos;t we give away 400 scholarships over the next year targeted to those people."</p><p>Of course, by helping its employees expand their knowledge and training, Infosys runs the risk of losing some of them to competitors. But, historically, offering these types of services to workers has engendered great loyalty to the companies that offer them.

Certain warehouses have built exclusive lanes for those using Relay check-ins, calling to mind the E-ZPass system that lets drivers skip manual toll collection booths on highways.</p><p>For a company so obsessed with logistics, and one that relies so much on truck drivers, one might expect Amazon to already have a series of automated systems in place that economize its delivery processes down to a single turn of a truck&apos;s tire. This is not the case.</p><p>"Relay is Amazon&apos;s first attempt at automating the truck delivery process, which is error-prone due to its reliance on phone calls and paperwork," Kim writes. "While Relay may have a narrow application today, it serves as the first connection point between Amazon and potentially millions of truck drivers, a job that&apos;s become one of the most common in the U.S. Amazon is reportedly looking into other services as well, including an app that would match truck drivers with cargo shippers."</p><p>Given how completely dominant Amazon has been to this point in destroying its competitors, the idea that the company still has room to make its operations more efficient is a bit scary.

Companies are required to report the frequency with which these humans need to step in to control the car.</p><p>Uber, which has tested AVs in Arizona and Pennsylvania, received its permit to operate driverless cars in California in March of this year.

Riding in the "driver&apos;s" seat of an autonomous vehicle as it makes unexpected turns and stops can result in a serious case of motion sickness.</P><p>The fact that a passenger freed from keeping his or her eyes on the road will likely look down at the screen of a mobile device instead only compounds the chances of getting carsick. While far from the most serious challenge confronting AV engineers, it is nevertheless an important one since the already difficult task of changing consumer behavior and showing them that autonomous vehicles are a viable form of transportation only becomes harder if those consumers are constantly losing their lunch.</p><p><a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="new">Uber</a>, it seems, has already developed some ideas for how to minimize motion sickness for its autonomous vehicle passengers. A <a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw" target="new">patent application</a> filed by the company on November 2 proposes a series of potential solutions.</p><p>"With the advent of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, rider attention may be focused on alternative activities, such as work, socializing, reading, writing, task-based activities (e.g., organization, bill payments, online shopping, gameplay) and the like," reads the background section of the patent application. "As the AV travels along an inputted route, kinetosis (i.e., motion sickness) can result from the perception of motion by a rider for not corresponding to the rider&apos;s vestibular senses."</p><p>One proposal is a light system inside the car to alert passengers about the times and locations of the autonomous system&apos;s planned turns and brakes. It would be similar to the turn signals and brake lights on the outside of a car that currently allow human drivers to communicate their actions and intentions to others, but would instead be designed for riders inside the very car from whence the signals come. When turns and stops are anticipated, they&apos;re far less likely to disrupt a passenger&apos;s sense of orientation.</p><p>As the patent acknowledges, passengers may very well be engrossed in their own activities.</P><p>A rider deep into a novel could easily miss such light signals. So other ideas in the patent application would affect passengers whether they were attentive or not. Seats could subtly twist along with turns, counteracting the movement of the car. Seats could also provide haptic feedback, vibrating during braking to alert the passenger.

Even though comparable smartphones sell for significantly less, Apple is able to convince customers that the design, functionality and quality of its products justifies the higher price point. Looking around at the number of people using Apple devices, it&apos;s hard to argue with that contention.</p><p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new">Tesla</a> is another company that warrants inclusion on that list.</p><p>As an innovator in electric and autonomous vehicle systems, the company represents a new kind of automotive company and it charges a premium for its leading edge approach. Despite the high price tags, Tesla&apos;s cars are overwhelmingly popular -- perhaps even <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/musk-model-3-tesla-production-delays/" target="new">too popular</a> for the company&apos;s own good.</p><p>Thus, there were two safe bets to be made when Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">first introduced</a> the company&apos;s electric Semi truck in November: It would be popular, and it would be expensive. While the initial announcement of the Tesla Semi did not include a price, recent developments shed light on the cost of the big rig.</p><p>The Semi&apos;s <a href="https://www.tesla.com/semi/" target="new">product page</a> was updated in late November to include the truck&apos;s "expected base price" as $150,000 for a model with a 300-mile battery range and $180,000 for a model with a 500-mile range. Those looking to reserve a Semi -- the release of which isn&apos;t expected until 2019 -- need to pay a $20,000 fee upfront.</p><p>By contrast, a standard diesel semi truck starts around $80,000, but can reach $150,000 or more depending on the number of options.</p><p>Tesla&apos;s prices are listed below a "fuel savings" figure of $200,000+, a not-so-subtle suggestion that the Semi will pay for itself thanks to the projected savings from switching from diesel to electric.</p><p>As Musk outlined in his introduction of the vehicle, cost savings are just one benefit.</P><p>The Semi is also expected to outperform current diesel truck models. Tesla claims the Semi can travel at 65 mph up a 5% grade, and will go from zero to 60 mph in 20 seconds while carrying an 80,000-pound load. There are also design upgrades. Most notably, the driver&apos;s seat will be positioned in the middle of the cockpit "like you&apos;re in a racecar," Musk said.</p><p>The truck appears to be delivering in the popularity category, as well. While the total number of orders Tesla has received is not available, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-truck/tesla-truck-gets-dhl-order-as-shippers-test-semi-idUSKBN1DS2MF" target="new">Reuters reports</a> that shipping companies like DHL, Wal-Mart and J.B.

Wal-Mart ordered 15 of the trucks, and DHL ordered 10.</p><p>Given the small order sizes from companies with enormous fleets, and given that the product won&apos;t be available until 2019 (or even later, given Tesla&apos;s penchant for pushing back deadlines), it&apos;s safe to infer that these orders weren&apos;t the result of black-and-white bottom-line calculations.

Each entry or "block" is connected to previous entries using cryptography, linking all of the blocks together in an immutable chain.</P><p>For the connected car industry, this means that data can be appended to the blockchain to give vehicles a decentralized digital identity. This will transform the way connected cars communicate with other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. And with it comes new and improved capabilities for insurance, vehicle history, ride sharing services and more.</p><p>Blockchain technology has the potential to not only expedite our path to automated vehicles, but it also opens the door for multiple connected car use cases today. Let&apos;s take a look at a few examples.</p><b>Enabling smart contracts</b><br/>One of the biggest benefits of blockchain is that the technology enables smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially programmatic code that can be executed on the blockchain. They can allow for the exchange of money, goods or services in a conflict-free way without the use of a middleman. </P> <p>This is huge for OEMs, telecom providers and insurance companies. A consumer could digitally purchase a connected car and drive off the lot in a matter of minutes. An oil change could be purchased by the vehicle and operationalized almost instantly. And insurance and toll payments could be made seamlessly and instantly by the vehicle.</P><b>Supporting V2X and V2I capabilities, and automated driving</b></br>As we begin to realize the potential of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2X) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technologies -- the capabilities that allows cars to talk to each other and objects around them -- blockchain could be a key enabler.</P><p>With blockchain technology, OEMs could benefit from quicker, more secure data transfers than are possible today. Every transmission would be traceable. </P><p>Ridesharing services could also benefit from more secure data transfer, location tracking and seamless payment between the passenger and the vehicle.</p><p>And as we look ahead to fully automated vehicles, information or currency could be exchanged between vehicles, infrastructure and other IoT devices via the blockchain.</p> <p>Each of these use cases will benefit current connected car functionalities and will also allow fully automated vehicles to become even closer to a reality. With blockchain, a car could refuel, park and then pay for those <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-move-self-driving-cars-fast-lane/" target="new">services all on its own</a>.</p><b>Overcoming barriers to adoption</b></br>Though blockchain is meant to provide an immutable public ledger, the technology itself still faces a few obstacles. Information privacy and device identity are still at risk as hackers can impersonate or have access to consumer data if a device&apos;s private keys are discovered.</p><p>Additionally, lack of general awareness and some industry skepticism will slow blockchain adoption.</p><p>If we can overcome these barriers, however, the realized benefits and use cases of blockchain will only continue to increase for IoT and connected car.</p><p>-- <i>Russell Vegh, Ph.D., is principal member of the technical staff at AT&T Internet of Things Solutions</i>.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Demystifying Blockchain for Connected Vehicles' --post_excerpt='Blockchain is helping to fuel interest in cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, however, the technology has other uses.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>In-vehicle entertainment is a sector that was primed for disruption even before the recent connected car boom.</p><p>There was a time when in-vehicle entertainment meant looking out the window, but since screens started popping up in the back of headrests in the early 2000s, infotainment systems have come a long way.</p><p>Early options required localized content -- most likely in the form of a DVD player -- but now services like streaming music and GPS navigation are commonplace. All of those iterations, however, still operate within the framework of a human in the driver&apos;s seat.</p><p>Still, with the rise of the self-driving car on the horizon, most automotive insiders are convinced that the real infotainment boom is yet to arrive. When drivers don&apos;t need to pay attention to the road, the theory goes, they&apos;ll be free to shop online, play video games or watch movies.</p><p>At November&apos;s Los Angeles Auto Show, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" target="new">Intel</a> and <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/" target="new">Warner Bros.</a> announced a joint venture that could take things even further. The software and entertainment giants unveiled an initiative called the AV Entertainment Experience to create immersive amusement specifically tailored to passengers of self-driving cars.</p><p>"Warner Bros. and Intel imagine significant possibilities inside the AV space. Not only do we see passengers consuming content ranging from movies and television programming, we imagine riders enjoying immersive experiences never seen before, courtesy of in-cabin virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) innovations," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/autonomous-driving-todays-biggest-game-changer/" target="new">an online editorial</a> describing the venture. "For example, a fan of the superhero Batman could enjoy riding in the Batmobile through the streets of Gotham City, while AR capabilities render the car a literal lens to the outside world, enabling passengers to view advertising and other discovery experiences."</p><p>Krzanich&apos;s post represents a significant departure from the traditional streaming of movies and TV that most non-driving passengers are already doing on their phones or tablets.</p><p>Intel and Warner Bros. aim to transition passengers from being passive consumers into active participants in the content they view. Augmented reality and virtual reality can adjust a user&apos;s perception of their environment or place them into a new environment entirely. Making those new experiences appealing to wary consumers, though, could become easier if the experiences revolve around known intellectual property, like Batman, which Warner Bros. possesses in abundance.</p><p>There are also interesting possibilities for advertisers.</p><p>Instead of paying for billboard advertisements, on-route restaurants may opt for animations that, through augmented reality, appear above their establishments in a passenger&apos;s field of vision. Such digital advertisements, they could be updated instantaneously to reflect of-the-moment deals or be customized to individual AV passengers&apos; preferences. It&apos;s a lucrative business opportunity for advertisers, automobile manufacturers, infotainment system designers and network service providers.</p><p>Historically, the restrictions of driving have limited the possibilities for in-vehicle entertainment. But with the concurrent emergence of driverless technology alongside VR and AR tech, the car may soon represent an even better opportunity for entertainment than the home.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Intel, Warner Bros.

Though they make cars, that company, founded in 1994, is officially known as simply Smart, one word.</p><p>Smartcar, on the other hand, is a Mountain View-based startup founded in 2014 that is developing a connected car platform. It can be debated how "smart" it is to start a company with a name so easily confused with another known entity, but there is clearly an appeal to being perceived as smart in the automotive space, although what that means has certainly evolved.</p><p>As a young startup, <a href="https://smartcar.com/" target="new">Smartcar</a> is relatively unknown. Prior to a presentation at November&apos;s Los Angeles Auto Show, the company&apos;s sparse website featured only a single blog post.</p><p>However, after a major announcement at the Auto Show, it seems likely we&apos;ll be hearing a whole lot more.

Currently, Blue Link can be used to for controlling certain features such as remote locking/unlocking/starting and climate control, as well as to provide on-demand vehicle diagnostics reports.</p><p>But with Smartcar, Blue Link will be able to do a whole lot more. Utilizing the location services and remote lock/unlock services, Smartcar will enable services such as grocery delivery or gas fill-ups to a parked car, even when the owner isn&apos;t present. The joint presentation at the LA Auto Show specifically referenced <a href="https://www.washos.com/" target="new">Washos</a>, an on-demand car washing and cleaning service, as a third party that will participate.</p><p>"Apps are a fundamental differentiator for car owners. Smartcar and Hyundai are advancing the creation of an ecosystem of apps and services for connected vehicles," said Smartcar CEO and co-founder Sahas Katta in a statement about the pilot program that will launch in California early in 2018 under the name Blue Link All-Access. "This partnership will bring unique experiences to Hyundai vehicle owners."</p><p>Hyundai is not the first high-profile collaboration that Smartcar has participated in. In June, the company <a href="https://blog.smartcar.com/smartcar-launches-connected-car-platform-in-germany-d631d821536a" target="new">announced</a> an agreement with BMW Group to launch its connected car platform in Germany for "applications [that include] insurance, expense tracking, smart home, gas stations, and mobility services."</p><p>Looking towards a future in which our roads are full of self-driving cars, many imagine that vehicles eventually will drive themselves to the grocery store or gas station.</p><p>With Blue Link All-Access, Smartcar and Hyundai are offering a connected car solution that is effectively the same.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>As the 21st-century automotive landscape takes shape, rental car companies find themselves at an inflection point.</p><p>These companies&apos; original business models have become antiquated. With ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, there is less of a need for travelers to rent a car at the airport. It&apos;s far easier to take an Uber everywhere than it is to stand in line at a rental counter, find a place to park in an unfamiliar city, and deal with filling up the tank before a return flight.</p><p>That said, the enormous fleets owned by car rental companies continue to be a substantial and valuable asset, especially as advancing connected car technologies allow for more efficient fleet management.</P><p>Those technological innovations could create new business opportunities for traditional rental car companies.</p><p>In late November, <a href="https://www.avis.com/en/home" target="new">Avis</a> made a move in this direction. The company announced the launch of Avis Mobility Lab, a test operation for a connected fleet that will comprise 20 rental car locations and 5,000 vehicles centered around Kansas City but reaching into Nebraska.</p><p>"Our Mobility Lab in the greater Kansas City area extends our next-generation mobility initiatives," Avis president and CEO Larry De Shon noted in a <a href="http://ir.avisbudgetgroup.com/releasedetail.cfm" target="new">statement</a>. "The steps we&apos;re taking with connected car and smart technologies will increase customer satisfaction as well as reduce operational costs in the near term, while also preparing us to meet the evolving needs of consumers, entrepreneurs, corporations and governments, like the City of Kansas City, a recognized global leader for its Smart City advancements." </p><p>The initiative looks set to yield substantial benefits for both Avis and the Kansas City community. Avis will make its own operations more efficient and cost-effective thanks to real-time vehicle diagnostics and analytics. Among other data, cars will automatically report back fuel levels and maintenance needs, ensuring that vehicles are serviced in a timely manner, which prevents more costly maintenance down the line.</p><p>As for the city, a central infrastructure will be developed that allows Avis&apos;s connected cars to report traffic data, effectively serving as the city&apos;s real-time eyes and ears on the road. For example, this V2I data can be leveraged to optimize traffic light intervals to suit current traffic patterns. Over the long term, the information can help the city take a more informed approach to its road and transportation projects. </p><p>"Kansas City has a fully integrated suite of smart city initiatives in our community that make it a better place for our citizens and visitors.

In a city, the density of vehicles is much higher, which leaves less margin for error than on a highway. There are also far more irrational actors, such as pedestrians and cyclists, whose movements cannot be predicted with great accuracy.</p><p>That can force an autonomous system to react much quicker than it is capable of doing currently, and the reaction may not always be the right one. The level of artificial intelligence necessary to operate a driverless car in rush hour city traffic is higher by an order of magnitude compared to highway driving.</p><p>For autonomous vehicle developers, this type of AI challenge is to be welcomed, not avoided.</p><p>Operating out of San Francisco, <a href="http://www.gm.com/" target="new">General Motors</a> self-driving subsidiary <a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new">Cruise Automation</a> has aggressively tested its driverless vehicles in complicated urban settings for quite some time. According to <a href="https://www.gm.com/content/dam/gm/events/docs/5265893-685163-Chartset-11-30-2017" target="new">a slideshow</a> released on the company&apos;s website in advance of an investor presentation in late November, the company is scaling up its efforts in cities by launching a commercial AV service in "dense urban environments" starting in 2019.</p><p>The presentation imagines a future with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero traffic congestion. It is relentlessly optimistic, and positions GM as a leader in autonomy and the "only fully integrated developer of AVs with true scale ability."</p><p>The reasons GM puts forward for its AV superiority range from big-name hires to impending technological breakthroughs. On the talent front, GM has recruited former Uber engineer AG Gandgadhar as the first ever CTO of Cruise, former Netflix executive Tawni Cranz as its new chief HR officer, and former Google Maps program manager Ashwin Prabhu as head of mapping operations.</p><p>On the tech front, GM says its Lidar developments are game-changing. While currently available Lidar systems are described as having quality issues and a $20,000 price tag, Cruise claims its <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">acquisition of Strobe</a> will enable it to manufacture a Lidar system that is more than twice as effective as current products at a cost of only $300 per unit.</p><p>In October, Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt published a <a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/why-testing-self-driving-cars-in-sf-is-challenging-but-necessary-77dbe8345927" target="new">Medium post</a> underlining the philosophy that drives his company to pursue deployment in urban environments specifically.</p><p>"Our path to scale starts with fleet deployments in the most dense urban environments, where high utilization rates generate sustainable unit economics even at low initial vehicle volumes," Vogt wrote. "As we ramp up volume, we&apos;ll drive down costs and gradually roll out our technology to suburban and rural areas where ride sharing is less common today. It takes scale in order to reach these areas and achieve a significant impact on society, so for us anything less than that is failure (and probably an unsustainable business)."</p><p>There was no mention of which cities Cruise would be expanding into.

Lawmakers want to get rules on the books to govern the industry before the horse gets too far out of the barn.</p><p>Recently AV bills made it out of committee with a great deal of support in both the House and the Senate. But according to a report by <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/362883-driverless-car-bill-hits-senate-speed-bump" target="new">The Hill</a>, the Senate bill, known as the American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies (AV START) Act, may undergo some changes before its sponsors are ready to introduce it to a vote in the chamber.</p><p>"Bill sponsors hope to iron out some of the kinks over the next few weeks, but it&apos;s unclear whether major sticking points, such as concerns over safety and trucks being excluded from the legislation, can be easily resolved," The Hill reported. "The Senate is also facing a tight timeline and daunting to-do list before the end of this year, including spending bills and a major tax overhaul."</p><p>The legislation is currently going through a process known as "hotlining." The term refers to bill sponsors getting feedback from other senators and making revisions to help ensure the legislation has the votes needed before bringing it to a vote.</p><p>"Some folks have some holds on it. There are some folks who have some issues," US Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) told The Hill. Peters is one of the bill&apos;s two co-sponsors along with South Dakota Republican John Thune. "We&apos;re going to keep working on it."</p><p>Bloomberg <a href="https://twitter.com/SCourtneyDC/status/936674671264661505" target="new">reported</a> that Sens.

The Senate bill proposes widening this number to 25,000, and ultimately increasing it to 100,000 within three years.</p><p>It also seeks to organize various committees to ensure that AV technology lives up to its society-helping potential, including a group to establish methods for improving transportation opportunities for the elderly and disabled.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Senate&apos;s Driverless Car Bill Hits Snag' --post_excerpt='US Senators Gary Peters and John Thune are working to keep the autonomous vehicle legislation moving.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Senate&apos;s Driverless Car Bill Hits Snag' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-12-12 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-12-12 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,6,7,9" --tags_input='AV Start, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, driverless, Senate legislation, Gary Peters' --tax_input=''

As is the case with any new tech product, prices will be significantly higher until there is widespread adoption and economies of scale start taking effect.</p><p>The first iterations of high-definition flat-panel TVs cost well-into five figures, but now run just a few hundred bucks. A similar trajectory can be expected with autonomous vehicles.</p><p>But with the societal transformation that is predicted with self-driving cars, considerably more attention is being paid to pinpointing exactly when AVs will become affordable for mainstream consumers. Some have even framed the adoption of driverless cars as a public health issue because of the drop in traffic fatalities that is predicted to occur.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/self-driving-ceo-sees-2018-as-dawn-of-robot-taxis-delivery-cars" target="new">an interview</a> with Bloomberg, the CEO of connected and autonomous car company <a href="http://www.aptiv.com/" target="new">Aptiv</a> Kevin Clark spoke about the challenges that stand in the way of making AVs affordable, and when he believed they would be overcome. He speculated that prices for AV hardware components won&apos;t be low enough to make driverless cars widely affordable to consumers until the year 2025, but that commercial enterprises will step in in the interim and widely adopt self-driving technology.</p><p>"When you look at the commercial market -- areas where you have a driver in a vehicle -- there is financial incentive to use autonomous driving," Clark told Bloomberg. "Those customers are willing to pay a much higher price."</p><p>One interesting note about Clark&apos;s timeline is that by the time his prognosis of affordable autonomous vehicles comes true, societal norms may have shifted even further away from the idea of private car ownership in general.</p><p>There is a widespread belief that the future of automobile transportation lies not in traditional personal car ownership, but in widespread usage of ride-sharing and ride-hailing services.</p><p>Even before autonomous vehicles, consumers were discovering the benefits of <em>not</em> owning a car and that trend seems unlikely to change as on-demand mobility services improve even further. So creating autonomous vehicles for commercial enterprises such as Uber and Lyft could end up being not just an intermediate step, but the final one.</p><p>But ride-hailing companies could also benefit from lower costs. Clark said he believes that Lidar technology costs will come down significantly in the years to come. Current Lidar sensors can drive the cost of an autonomous vehicle up to $150,000. Clark thinks that once Lidar sensors become solid-state, instead of involving a multitude of moving parts as they do currently, that the price for Lidar units will come down to $5,000 by 2025.</p><p>Formerly known as Delphi Automotive, Aptiv was born when Delphi split into two separate publicly traded companies: Aptiv and Delphi Technologies. Aptiv specializes in autonomous and connected driving systems, while Delphi Technologies runs the powertrain operations upon which the company built its foundation.</p><p>"At a time of unprecedented industry change, the underlying strength of both our operating businesses and strategic partnerships will allow each company to focus even more sharply on its unique opportunities, continue to develop the very best advanced technologies, and help our customers navigate the road ahead," Clark <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">said</a> when the spin-off was first announced in May.</p><p>The companies seem to be well on their way to achieving those goals. Of course, <em>how</em> those customers navigate the road in the years to come still remains to be seen.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Aptiv CEO: AV Costs Won&apos;t Drop Significantly Until 2025' --post_excerpt='Aptiv CEO Kevin Clark believes that commercial ride-hailing services will take the lead on AV adoption.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Aptiv CEO: AV Costs Won&apos;t Drop Significantly Until 2025' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-12-13 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-12-13 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,6,7,8" --tags_input='Aptiv, Delphi, Kevin Clark, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, driverless, Lidar' --tax_input=''

One of the most important points Kapoor made is that there isn&apos;t even just one race taking place. The actual number is too high to be pegged. Kapoor cited mapping and insurance and regulation as just some examples of industries in which AV-specific business competitions are unfolding.</p><p>"There&apos;s going to be an opportunity for a lot of people in this ecosystem.

When people are no longer driving cars themselves, they will be looking for other things to do. This will open possibilities for new revenue streams for various forms of entertainment, food, or work productivity enterprises.</p><p>"It&apos;s all about the adjacencies," Adam Jones, an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">said</a> in July. "If you invest in that, you&apos;re less likely to be buying an over-hyped situation."</p><p>Kapoor touched on this fluid nature in his comments.</p><p>"The complexity, and the lack of standards, is causing a lot of vertical integrations and partnerships of &apos;maybe I can use this technology,&apos;" he said at the conference.</p><p>While it may be too soon to crown a champion, it is becoming more and more clear who the players are.</p><p>As the industry evolves, it is less likely that some completely unknown entity will enter the fray and move the needle.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>While the experience of a car driving humans instead of humans driving cars is set to be a jarring transition, it&apos;s possible that things won&apos;t be drastically different for many aspects of the automotive industry.</p><p>The number of cars manufactured and sold annually could hold steady, the lifespans of the cars might remain the same, and the frequency of service could stay constant. </p><p>The same cannot be said for auto insurers.</p><p>Currently car insurance companies business models rely heavily on the liability of the insured -- in other words, the drivers. If a self-driving car gets in an accident with another self-driving car, it is unlikely that the passenger, even one sitting in what is ostensibly the driver&apos;s seat, would be responsible.</p><p>So will people still need auto insurance? And if they do who, or what, will be insured?</p><p>In an article for the <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/driverless-cars-will-change-auto-insurance-heres-how-insurers-can-adapt" target="new">Harvard Business Review</a> entitled, "Driverless Cars Will Change Auto Insurance. Here&apos;s How Insurers Can Adapt," two executives from the consulting firm Accenture, John Cusano and Michael Costonis, address this issue and describe what the future will look like for the companies involved.</p><p>Here are three things the $200 billion auto insurance industry can expect as self-driving cars become the norm, and what they will mean for their businesses.</p><p><strong>1. Individual vehicle ownership will decline</strong></p><p>While fewer individual people are likely to own a personal car, the amount of vehicles owned by fleet companies will skyrocket. This trend is already taking place thanks to a variety of interrelated factors that have nothing to do with autonomous systems, such as waning interest in driving among young people, accelerating patterns of urbanization, and the rise of ride-hailing services. The same self-driving cars that is prohibitively expensive for an individual could represent an immediate cost savings for corporations thanks to their ability to operate 24 hours a day.</p><p>"We believe that most fully autonomous vehicles will not be owned by individuals, but by auto manufacturers such as General Motors, by technology companies such as Google and Apple, and by other service providers such as ride-sharing services," write Cusano and Costonis.</p><p>For insurance companies, a decline in individual car ownership will lead to lower overall premiums. That could lead to a steep drop in profit margins for the insurers.</p><p><strong>2. Fewer human drivers means fewer accidents</strong></p><p>Insurance premiums are, of course, based on risk. That&apos;s why the parents of teenage drivers have to make sky-high monthly payments for their kids to get behind the wheel. But when AV systems take over, those types of calculations for individual drivers will no longer apply.</p><p>"Since as many as 94% of accidents are attributed to human error, the number and severity of accidents and insurance claims will drop, also leading to lower premiums as insurers learn to price in accordance with real risk," write Costonis and Cusano.</p><p>Assuming that self-driving cars become more mainstream in 2026, the drop in vehicle ownership and the drop in accident probability, could lead to as much as a $25 billion per year loss for auto insurance companies.</p><p><strong>3. Change means new opportunities for insurers</strong></p><p>The news isn&apos;t all bad for auto insurance companies, so long as they are able to find ways to pivot. Cusano and Costonis list three potential new sources of revenue for car insurers when autonomous vehicles become the norm: cybersecurity, product liability and infrastructure insurance. The digital systems that underlie a self-driving car will be in need of protection, and such a role seems like a perfect fit for evolving auto insurers.</p><p>The authors suggest that protecting cars against hacking, cyber theft, and ransomware attacks could generate up to $12 billion annually in additional premiums. Helping manufacturers protect themselves against the potential liability from software bugs, memory overloads, and algorithm defects represents another potential $1.5 billion annual revenue bump. And insuring things like the cloud servers that power the infrastructure assets that communicate and manage autonomous vehicles could account for $500 million per year.</p><p>"In the aggregate, these areas can generate $81 billion through 2026 ($15 billion per year from 2020 to 2026, with some fluctuations) and can more than offset the losses in premiums expected through 2050," the pair write.</p><p>So while there remains plenty of uncertainty as car insurance agencies undergo a fundamental shift, it is clear that that shift represents a chance for companies to find new opportunities that are more sustainable for the long haul.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='What Self-Driving Vehicles Mean for the Car Insurance Industry' --post_excerpt='Declining car insurance premiums could be offset by new coverage opportunities.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='What Self-Driving Vehicles Mean for the Car Insurance Industry' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-12-14 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-12-14 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,4,6,7,8,9" --tags_input='auto insurance, car insurance, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, driverless, Harvard Business Review, Accenture' --tax_input=''

This is especially true in and around Detroit, which, while having made great economic gains in the last decade or so, is still recovering from serious decline suffered in the latter half of the 20th century.</p><p>Since electric vehicles are notoriously low-margin products, it&apos;s easy to see why <a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="new">Ford</a> would opt to build in Mexico, where manufacturing is cheaper.

He cited four core characteristics of the the car and its design, saying it would be "commercial grade," "hybrid-electric," "designed for purpose," and "integrated for safety."</p><p>"Our commercial fleets are known for their lower cost of ownership and durability," Farley wrote. "We&apos;re applying this knowledge and experience to our self-driving vehicle so it will be ready to meet the needs of both ride-hailing and delivery businesses operating in tough urban environments. Customers will only benefit if our vehicles are on the road, versus in the shop, so this is a critical component for a successful business."</p><p>By developing a hybrid-electric autonomous vehicle, Ford is charting a unique course.</p><p>The prevailing belief is that the autonomous vehicles of the future will be entirely electric. And many of the driverless cars being tested today are already in line with that philosophy. With its hybrid strategy, Ford is banking that its customers will place a greater value on mileage range. A hybrid-electric vehicle can travel further faster than an all-electric one because of its dual fuel sources and the lack of need for timely charging.</p><p>Farley also notes that the hybrid approach will assist in the specific needs of an autonomous vehicle.</p><p>"Hybrids help provide the significant amount of electrical power required for self-driving sensors and computing systems without having a significant impact on the mileage," he writes.</p><p>Ford&apos;s work on this project will involve <a href="https://www.argo.ai/" target="new">Argo AI</a>, the Pittsburgh autonomous developer that the automaker invested $1 billion in in February.

First, we want to let members of the public experience driverless vehicles firsthand, so they can better understand the impact this new technology will have on their lives," NuTonomy wrote in a blog post. "Second, based on feedback from pilot participants, NuTonomy&apos;s engineers will adapt and improve our system, so that we can deliver an autonomous transportation experience that is extremely safe, efficient, and comfortable."</p><p>The second goal is pretty standard.</p><p>All product designers use customer feedback to improve future products. But by acknowledging the reservations many people have when it comes to autonomous vehicles, Lyft and NuTonomy are taking an honest approach that could pay big dividends.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>In the world of startups, "stealth mode" refers to companies that develop a product with zero public profile whatsoever.</p><p>The practice has become increasingly popular in recent years. One of the advantages of operating in secrecy is that it prevents competitors, especially large companies with abundant resources, from putting those resources to use in order to copy and scale a similar product.</p><p>Stealth mode also helps a startup make a huge bang when it comes out of the shadows. And then there&apos;s the advantage of not having to adhere to publicly announced timelines or show off new technology before it&apos;s complete.</p><p>In the world of autonomous vehicles, few companies come out of stealth mode with the same momentum as <a href="https://www.ouster.io/" target="new">Ouster</a>.</p><p>The San Francisco Lidar company not only came out of stealth mode with the announcement that it had received a whopping $27 million in funding from investors such as Cox Enterprises and Amity Ventures, but Ouster also said that its 64-laser Lidar sensor, the OS1, is 60 times lighter, 30 times smaller and three times more energy efficient than the <a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new">Velodyne</a> HDL-64 Lidar, which is the current industry standard. Perhaps most importantly, at $12,000, Ouster&apos;s Lidar is six times cheaper than Velodyne&apos;s, and it&apos;s available for purchase right now.</p><p>As Ouster CEO and Co-Founder Angus Pacala told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/12/11/robocar-lidar-startup-ouster-has-a-novel-pitch-you-can-buy-our-sensor-now/" target="new">Forbes</a>, there has been a lot of talk about improving Lidar and lowering its price, but it hasn&apos;t gone beyond talk. He explained his company&apos;s rationale for remaining in stealth mode as a desire to make sure it could walk the walk before it talked the talk.</p><p>"The fact that we have a device that&apos;s on the market... is a really big deal very few other companies can claim," Pacala said. "Most companies are making the claim that they&apos;ll have something at some point, but they don&apos;t have anything now. We&apos;ve really tried to avoid hyping the company or the products before they&apos;re available... to reverse this trend of brinksmanship when it comes to Lidar."</p><p>Ouster says that it will begin manufacturing up to 1,000 units of the OS1 per month at its San Francisco factory beginning in January 2018 and hopes to ramp that number up to 10,000 units per month by the end of the year.</p><p>Pacala says that some early customers have already begun receiving their Lidars.</p><p>Usually the foundation of an autonomous vehicle&apos;s sensor suite, Lidar sensors shoot out thousands of laser pulses per second, bouncing them off of surrounding objects. The speed with which a given pulse bounces back to the sensor allows accompanying software systems to construct a sort of three-dimensional map of its surroundings, telling the self-driving system what is around it and how fast it is traveling. In its early iterations, Lidar sensors became known for their "coffee can" shape atop self-driving prototypes; Pacala says the Ouster OS1 Lidar is half the size of a coffee <em>mug</em>.</p><p>While Ouster claims the resolution of its Lidar matches that of the HDL-64, that may be an outdated standard. In November, Velodyne announced it was <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">set to begin production</a> on the VLS-128, a Lidar product with twice as many lasers and significantly higher resolution. But the HDL-64 already retails for over $70,000, so it stands to reason that the new and improved version will cost even more. </p><p>Of course, now that Pacala&apos;s company is out of stealth mode, it still has to show customers that its Lidar does what he says it does. But if Ouster can match the capabilities of the HDL-64 at one sixth the price while being smaller and more efficient, it could potentially challenge Velodyne for Lidar supremacy.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Lidar Startup Ouster Emerges With $27M in Funding' --post_excerpt='Fresh out of stealth mode, Ouster says its Lidar sensor is better and cheaper than competitors such as Velodyne.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Lidar Startup Ouster Emerges With $27M in Funding' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-12-20 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-12-20 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,6,8,9" --tags_input='Ouster, Lidar, autonomous vehicles, self-driving, driverless, Velodyne, laser' --tax_input=''

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Self-driving concept vehicles from decades past can be pretty funny to look at now.</p><p>With the technology so far away, there was a pretty diverse idea of what a driverless car might look like. Some were 22nd-century sleek, while others were bulbous, bordering on spherical creations, which seemed to exist outside of time and space.</p><p>Some prophesied functionality far beyond what&apos;s currently available -- flying cars, anyone? -- but as the reality of self-driving cars comes more and more into focus, a design language is starting to emerge. It might seem boring, but self-driving cars look a lot like regular old human-driven cars.</p><p>Fortunately, some autonomous vehicle designers are still drawing up concepts with the same joyous sense of possibility that made the idea of the self-driving car intriguing in the first place.</p><p>That is certainly the case with a new design from <a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/en/" target="new">Rinspeed AG</a>, a "creative think tank and mobility lab for the automotive industry." Known as the <a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/en/Snap_48_concept-car.html" target="new">Rinspeed Snap</a>, the box-like vehicle features a chassis referred to as a "skateboard" that can separate from the passenger compartment, known as the "cell." Snap skateboards are designed to be interchangeable with different cells, depending on what the vehicle is being used for on any given trip.</p><p>"The pod can even be useful when stationary: it can be anything from a variable shopping pod or a spacious camping pod to a cozy cuddling pod and even provide a breathtaking, fully connected user experience for the occupants of the passenger cabin," Rinspeed wrote in a <a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/upload/conceptfiles/SnapMainPR2018.pdf" target="new">statement</a>. "The sky is here the limit for the possible applications."</p><p>Choosing to design a series of use-specific passenger cabins instead of a single versatile cabin is a fascinating example of futuristic thinking.</p><p>The concept probably belongs to a future that&apos;s quite far away, but it&apos;s fun to imagine choosing between pods designed for business meetings, movie viewing, or sleeping depending on the purpose of your journey. <a href="https://blog.caranddriver.com/kiss-me-im-in-an-autonomous-car-rinspeed-snap-concept-is-for-cuddling/" target="new">Car and Driver</a> rightly seized on the humor of the idea of a "cozy cuddling pod," but hey, why not? Autonomous vehicle passengers will need to redirect their attention <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">somewhere</a>.</p><p>Rinspeed equipped its theoretical concept vehicle with components that do not exist yet. For example, Rinspeed said the Snap would feature a "True Level 5 HMI" (human-machine interface) designed by <a href="https://services.harman.com/" target="new">Harman</a>. Of course, just like every other automotive or tech company, Harman is yet to design a system for level 5 vehicular autonomy. But the Snap is also said to be powered by the <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Harman Ignite platform</a> for connected cars, a product that <em>does</em> exist. Other companies whose products, both real and imagined, are involved include ZF, Borbet, Sika Automotive, Gentex, Ibeo, Boeing and NXP.</p><p>This AV concept release has become an annual tradition for Rinspeed, with the designs growing zanier each year. The 2015 <a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/en/Budii_23_concept-car.html" target="new">Budii</a> looked something like a hybrid sedan of today. But the 2017 <a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/en/Oasis_21_concept-car.html" target="new">Oasis</a> had an aesthetic straight out of the Star Wars prequels. (The Snap is Rinspeed&apos;s 2018 design.)</p><p>But in order for autonomous vehicle design to move forward by leaps and bounds, companies like Rinspeed need to continue keeping it weird.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>While they exist in varying degrees, there are really only two fundamental problems that a tech product can have: it doesn&apos;t work or it can&apos;t be acquired.</p><p>Every new piece of technology that gets released claims to solve some problem, but if it doesn&apos;t do that or can&apos;t be purchased, it&apos;s a non-starter.</p><p>For the Lidar sensors that underpin the majority of self-driving cars right now, both issues exist to a degree. Lidar technology <em>does</em> work, but some argue it is not sophisticated enough to be reliable for vehicles traveling at highway speeds.</p><p>And while Lidar sensors can be purchased, they come at a very steep price.</p><p>The cost is so high that many industry insiders say that autonomous vehicles won&apos;t become a viable mobility option until the price comes down significantly. Talk of how to make Lidar better and cheaper dominates the self-driving car news cycle.</p><p>Where there&apos;s a widely acknowledged problem, there are sure to be a wide swath of companies looking to solve it, and profit from it.</p><p>One of those is <a href="http://www.tetravue.com/" target="new">TetraVue</a>, a startup based in Vista, Calif. TetraVue is focusing its efforts on a form of Lidar, known as flash Lidar, that would be new to the consumer AV industry. The traditional Lidar sensors that power most of the self-driving cars of today operate by moving and sending out millions of laser pulses per second. Flash Lidar sensors, on the other hand, take a "snapshot" of a vehicle&apos;s surroundings in such a way that a 2D image is transformed into a 3D one and still delivers range information. </p><p>Flash lidar is essentially a hybrid of standard Lidar sensors and video cameras. The data from a flash Lidar provides an autonomous operating system with a three-dimensional, high-resolution feed of its surroundings. Tetravue CEO Hal Zarem told <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/tetravue-says-its-lidar-will-dominate-the-robocar-business" target="new">IEEE Spectrum</a> that he thinks his company can replace traditional Lidars and reduce the role of radar and cameras.</p><p>Of course, all this means little without knowing how much a flash Lidar will cost, and TetraVue has yet to release any pricing information. Flash Lidars are not new. They have been used for military applications for quite some time. In those situations, money is no object. Consumer applications are a different story. But Zarem says the TetraVue flash Lidar sensors will be affordable compared with traditional, high-end Lidars.</p><p>"In mass production, we think we can get to the cost points the industry requires, on the order of a few hundred dollars," Zarem told IEEE Spectrum. For comparison, the <a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new">Velodyne</a> HDL-64 Lidar, which is as close to an industry standard as there is right now, retails for around $70,000, and <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">a newer model</a>, with twice the lasers has already been announced.</p><p>Earlier this year, TetraVue announced a <a href="http://www.hatch-mag.com/2017/02/21/startup-buzz-tetravue-raises-10-million/" target="new">$10 million Series A</a> round of fundraising led by Robert Bosch Venture Capital and Nautilus Venture Partners. The money was raised to further develop its flash Lidar. The device is apparently far enough along that TetraVue <a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/14/1262004/0/en/TetraVue-Debuts-First-Long-Range-High-Resolution-4D-Camera-at-CES-2018.html" target="new">announced</a> that it would debut the product at the CES 2018 trade show in Las Vegas in January. </p><p>In its announcement, TetraVue wasn&apos;t shy about the new product&apos;s potential.</p><p>"This new camera technology is poised to transform markets including autonomous vehicles, machine vision, factory automation and the entertainment industry," according to TetraVue.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='TetraVue Thinks Flash Lidar Could Be a Game Changer' --post_excerpt='TetraVue raised $10 million earlier this year to fund new Lidar sensor technology.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='TetraVue Thinks Flash Lidar Could Be a Game Changer' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-12-22 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-12-22 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,6,8,9" --tags_input='TetraVue, Lidar, autonomous vehicle, self-driving, driverless, Hal Zarem, radar, sensor' --tax_input=''

"So in a way it&apos;s like [Amazon Web Services], in that you can deploy software on it and you don&apos;t have to manage where it goes, you don&apos;t have to manage its lifecycle or data orchestration -- that&apos;s all done for you."</p><p>There are not a lot of specifics about Samsung&apos;s plans in the driverless car space, but president Young Sohn <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">recently said</a> he thinks the company&apos;s revenue from automotives can quadruple from $5 billion today to $20 billion in 2025.</p><p>In August, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/samsung-secures-self-driving-car-testing-permit-for-california-roads/" target="new">revealed</a> that Samsung had been added to the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing" target="new">California DMV&apos;s list</a> of entities that have received permits to test self-driving cars in the state.</p><p>While Renovo received a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-invests-in-self-driving-car-startup-renovo-1493298001" target="new">$10 million round</a> of funding from Verizon&apos;s True Ventures in April, the company has remained mostly under the radar as it pursues an OS for self-driving cars.

Claude Perdriel and Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn share the same conviction, that with the development of the connected driverless vehicle, users will have more time to spend on other activities while in the car," the two companies said in a <a href="https://media.group.renault.com/global/en-gb/groupe-renault/media/pressreleases/21201612/groupe-renault-acquiert-une-participation-de-40-dans-le-groupe-de-presse-challenges" target="new">joint statement</a>. "Together, the Challenges Group and Groupe Renault have everything that is needed to create a &apos;lab for testing innovation&apos; to develop new editorial content and relevant technologies."</p><p>However, the same obstacles that magazine publishers face in attracting new readers in traditional settings won&apos;t disappear just because those potential readers are seated in an autonomous vehicle. Magazine publishers have long struggled to transition into digital media companies and have failed to make up for the loss of print advertising revenue. Even digital native media companies are facing a bumpy road as they try, and mostly fail, to "<a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/7/3/16045198/fox-sports-mtv-news-vocativ-layoffs-pivot-to-video-77e441a49cb7" target="new">pivot to video</a>." It&apos;s somewhat difficult to imagine a medium-sized French publisher paving the way for the on-road entertainment of tomorrow.</p><p>Jalopnik called the acquisition "<a href="https://jalopnik.com/in-insane-move-renault-buys-stake-in-media-company-to-1821270563" target="target">insane</a>," primarily because Renault seems to be putting the cart before the horse. Renault doesn&apos;t expect its driverless car to be ready for another five years, so investing in a media company at this point seems a bit premature. </p><p>"The hurdles [for autonomous vehicles] -- regulations, public adoption, the technology itself actually working -- are sky-high to clear, but Renault felt it&apos;s worth the risk," wrote tech reporter Ryan Felton.</p><p>While autonomous vehicles do face a series of obstacles before becoming commonplace on our roads, it&apos;s an impending reality in which automakers, tech companies and venture capitalists have already invested billions upon billions of dollars. To a certain extent, the autonomous vehicle industry may be approaching "too big to fail" status.</p><p>But that doesn&apos;t mean that driverless cars can save print.</p><p>Even Renault and Challenges acknowledged in their joint statement: "In France, 5,000 newspaper kiosks are going out of business every year." And the novelty of reading a periodical in a self-driving car probably isn&apos;t enough to alter the public&apos;s media consumption habits.</p><p>The fact that companies like Intel and Warner Bros. are working on <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">immersive Batman experiences</a> for the self-driving car that utilize augmented reality doesn&apos;t make things any easier for the already-challenged magazine industry.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Renault Wants to Entertain Driverless Car Passengers' --post_excerpt='Renault and Challenges Group will work to develop autonomous vehicle-exclusive content.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Renault Wants to Entertain Driverless Car Passengers' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2017-12-26 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2017-12-26 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='Renault, Challenges Publishing, magazines, publishing, autonomous vehicles, self-driving, driverless' --tax_input=''

For a limited but invaluable amount of time, the company successful in doing so will face literally no competition.</p><p>Being the first to <em>announce</em> a new product allows a company to be the center of attention in the press, which can have a great influence on public perception and brand identity. But the Ricky Bobby mantra from <em>Talladega Nights</em>, "If you&apos;re not first, you&apos;re last," doesn&apos;t always hold true in business. And being beaten to market is not necessarily a sign of failure.</p><p>Apple was far from the first to sell an MP3 player or make a smartphone, but that didn&apos;t stop the iPod and iPhone from establishing dominant market positions.</p><p>That&apos;s certainly what <a href="http://www.thortrucks.com/" target="new">Thor Trucks</a> is hoping for with its new offering. Thor announced its forthcoming all-electric semi truck -- the ET-One -- a few weeks after <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new">Tesla</a> made major news with the <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">unveiling of its own Semi</a>.</p><p>While Thor may have lost the first-to-announce battle, the trucking startup is hoping to win the war. They already have one advantage. As Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/this-electric-truck-will-probably-beat-tesla-s-to-market" target="new">put it</a> in its headline, "This electric truck will probably beat Tesla&apos;s to market."</p><p>With an expected launch in 2019, the same as Tesla&apos;s Semi, not much is yet known about the ET-One. But Thor&apos;s electric truck will cost between $150,000 to $250,000, depending on configuration. The battery on Thor&apos;s truck can be fully charged in 90 minutes and has a range of 300 miles. The maximum speed of the ET-One will be 70 miles per hour.</p><p>So how does that compare to the Semi?</p><p>Well, Tesla models with a 300-mile battery range will cost $150,000, while the 500-mile range model will cost $180,000. Since the ET-One&apos;s range is billed as "up to" 300 miles, it&apos;s possible that only the pricier $250,000 model will be able to travel that far. If that&apos;s correct, the Tesla Semi would be a significantly better value than the ET-One when it comes to cost-per-mile. But it&apos;s tough to make too many apples-to-apples comparisons.</p><p>Tesla says its Semi can travel up to 65 mph up a 5% grade. But Thor puts no qualifiers on its 70-mph top speed.</p><p>Still, Tesla does have the advantage of being able to generate good PR whenever a new company places an order for Semis.</p><p>The list already includes <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/pepsico-tesla-orders/pepsico-makes-biggest-public-pre-order-of-tesla-semis-100-trucks-idUSL1N1OB1YR" target="new">Pepsi</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/anheuser-busch-preorders-40-tesla-semis.html" target="new">Anheuser-Busch</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/wal-mart-says-its-planning-to-test-teslas-new-electric-trucks.html" target="new">Wal-Mart</a>.</p><p>Thor, for its part, isn&apos;t taking pre-orders. They have said that they will, however, put on demos through 2018, and eventually open up pre-ordering before the truck is released.

But even if it does, and even if the ET-One&apos;s performance isn&apos;t quite as impressive, it may not matter. Thor has explicitly said that it&apos;s targeting the short-haul trucking market, perhaps even taking on delivery vans and work vehicles. The ET-One is just the beginning.</p><p>"There&apos;s a tendency to simplify the truck market and think there will be one winner here," Thor CEO Dakota Semler told Bloomberg.

The ACM is a public-private partnership. Corporations such as AT&T, Visteon, Toyota, Ford and Hyundai were founding partners.

The company announced that, by 2017, those 100 autonomous vehicles would service citizens in and around Gothenburg. In April 2016, Volvo upped the ante even further, saying that its 100-car program would roll out in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11380388/volvo-autonomous-cars-test-china-hakan-samuelsson" target="new">China</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/26/11512808/volvo-autonomous-car-drive-me-self-driving-england-uk-london" target="new">UK</a> at the same time as Sweden.</p><p>Volvo even went so far as to say that its driverless cars would operate in "unsupervised" mode on certain roadways, meaning that people in the driver&apos;s seat could read or watch movies at their leisure. </p><p>Those keeping a close eye on these developments have noticed that Drive Me did not launch to great fanfare in 2017. In fact, it did not launch at all. With days to spare in the calendar year, an <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20171212/COPY01/312129966/volvos-drive-me-takes-detour-on-road-to-full-autonomy" target="new">Automotive News Europe</a> report revealed that Volvo&apos;s Drive Me would not only be delayed, but significantly scaled back from the self-driving program that was promised back in 2015. The Gothenburg initiative will no longer feature 100 self-driving vehicles, but rather 100 <em>people</em> as participants in the driverless trial. The "self-driving" terminology may be a stretch, too, as Drive Me cars will debut with <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/autonomous-driving-levels-0-to-5-understanding-the-differences/" target="new">Level 2 autonomy</a>, something that is already available in various consumer automobiles. Volvo says it won&apos;t be able to have Level 4 autonomous systems on the road until 2021.</p><p>"On the journey, some of the questions that we thought were really difficult to answer have been answered much faster than we expected. And in some areas, we are finding that there were more issues to dig into and solve than we expected," Volvo AV director Marcus Rothoff told Automotive News Europe.</p><p>Volvo cited numerous reasons for the delay: making sure it don&apos;t betray customer trust by releasing an unfinished product, cost-prohibitive hardware, and the difficulty of designing electrical architectures for these vehicles. But one reason stands out as rather odd: AV technology is advancing <em>too quickly</em>.</p><p>"The development in sensor performance and processor capabilities is going so much faster than we expected in 2013," said Rothoff "Because advancements are being made at such a rapid pace, we want to make this decision as late as possible."</p><p>There&apos;s some logic there -- figuring out which Lidar company to hitch your wagon to is a big decision -- but the overall reasoning folds under scrutiny. How can a company that has failed to deliver a much-hyped product blame the fact that technology progressed at a rate even faster than initially expected?</p><p>Delays and postponements are part of business. And frankly, in an industry that is currently long on bold pronouncements and short on cars that can actually drive themselves, we&apos;ll likely see many more delays in the AV sector in the next four or five years.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that building driverless cars is still a very hard job, no matter how many rosy predictions knowledgeable people continue to make about their rollout.

Not only are they likely to find better rates, they can also find spaces that are more tailored to their preferences.</p><p>On the other side of the transaction, homeowners have become comfortable allowing strangers into their places, and the money from Airbnb rentals has become an important secondary source of income, or even a primary one. </p><p>Despite its prominence, Airbnb is just one example of the sharing economy. The business model has been adapted for owners of just about everything, even cars. <a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/" target="new">SnappCar</a> is a Dutch company that takes ride-sharing to another level, by allowing car owners to rent their cars to SnappCar users.</p><p>One can imagine the anxiety that goes along with handing over the keys to your car to a stranger.

To assuage car owners&apos; concerns, SnappCar has announced a partnership with telecom company <a href="https://www.teliacompany.com/en" target="new">Telia</a> to offer SnappCar owners a telematics service called Telia Sense, giving them the ability to track their car&apos;s activity, including its location, when it is being used through the service.</p><p>"Telia Sense is a perfect fit for us because our customers can keep an eye on their car when it&apos;s rented out," SnappCar Sweden head Fredrik Karlberg wrote in a <a href="https://iotbusinessnews.com/2017/12/15/20878-telia-partners-peer-peer-car-sharing-company-snapcar/" target="new">statement</a>.

With Airbnb, homeowners can use things like a Nest cam to monitor their place while they&apos;re away. Telia Sense provides SnappCar owners with a similar same ability to see monitor their cars and make sure they are handled respectfully. The owners also have the ability to leave feedback on renters so future owners can know whether or not the renters can be trusted.</p><p>Of course, there are legitimate reasons to want privacy for a drive in a rented car, including privacy for its own sake.

The US Justice Department notified Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the Waymo-Uber lawsuit, of a letter written by the attorney of former Uber Security Analyst Richard Jacobs. In the letter, Jacobs lays out a series of disturbing business practices that allegedly took place at Uber.</p><p>The letter was originally sent to Uber this past spring but was not presented during the lawsuit&apos;s discovery process, meaning jurors could be told that Uber withheld evidence in the case.</p><p>"Uber improperly withheld the Jacobs Letter, which exposes the extreme lengths it was willing to go both to get a leg up on competition and hide evidence of bad acts," a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/16/technology/uber-jacobs-letter/index.html" target="new">Waymo spokesperson wrote</a> in a statement. "Separate and apart from the letter, Waymo has accumulated significant evidence that Uber is using stolen Waymo trade secrets, including copying aspects of Waymo&apos;s Lidar designs down to the micron, and we look forward to trial."</p><p>While it remains to be seen how the alleged mishandling of Jacobs&apos;s letter will affect Uber in the trial, it&apos;s wholly possible that the contents of the letter will have far greater ramifications outside of the trial.</p><p>What Jacobs describes sounds like a company run by a Hollywood version of a corporate villain. Among other things, Jacobs alleges that Uber performed espionage against foreign countries, bribed foreign government officials, destroyed and falsified records and documents, spied on competing companies, and stole trade secrets from competitors. That last accusation is exactly the subject of Waymo&apos;s lawsuit.</p><p>In a statement regarding Jacobs&apos;s letter, Uber did not exactly make a strong denial.</p><p>"While we haven&apos;t substantiated all the claims in this letter -- and, importantly, any related to Waymo -- our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology," <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/12/15/16782534/alphabet-waymo-uber-self-driving-lawsuit-jacobs-letter-surveillance" target="new">said</a> a spokesperson.</p><p>The letter scandal is a fitting end to a disastrous 2017 for Uber. In February, a <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/02/03/uber-lyft-delete-donald-trump-executive-order/" target="new">controversy</a> in the wake of President Trump&apos;s immigration ban caused over 200,000 customers to delete the Uber app. Various other scandals, including a series of reports about Uber&apos;s toxic and sexist corporate culture, forced CEO Travis Kalanick to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns" target="new">resign</a> in June. </p><p>As Uber has endured scandal after scandal, it has provided a boost to competitors. It has given a particular lift to Lyft. And given how quickly the automotive world is changing, there&apos;s no telling how far Uber might fall if it loses the Waymo lawsuit.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Justice Department Letter Charges Uber With Bribery, Hacking ' --post_excerpt='Uber&apos;s 2017 woes look to continue this year.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Justice Department Letter Charges Uber With Bribery, Hacking ' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2018-01-02 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2018-01-02 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,5,6,8" --tags_input='Uber, Waymo, Google, Anthony Levandowski, Lidar, autonomous vehicle, self-driving, driverless' --tax_input=''

Even if the sensors themselves are unobstructed, sheets of snow or ice on pavement can block lane markings, limiting an autonomous vehicle&apos;s ability to locate itself on the road. Then there&apos;s the general difficulty of navigating on icy roads. Human drivers rely a lot on feel to maneuver in slippery conditions. Programming that nebulous "feel" into a computer is a true feat of engineering.</p><p>But autonomous vehicles don&apos;t get to decide which weather they drive in. They need to be ready for all conditions.</p><p>That is why so much attention has been paid to testing driverless cars in wintry conditions. Of course, that can be difficult to do in popular self-driving sites such as California and Arizona. But Finland doesn&apos;t have such problems.</P><p>That is what allowed the <a href="http://www.vttresearch.com/" target="new">VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland</a> to develop what it says is the first self-driving car to operate independently on a real snow-covered road. The drive was accomplished in the Northern Finnish town of Muonio by a self-driving car known as Martti. It is one of two AVs designed by VTT. The other&apos;s name is Marilyn.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3GgJoVTHSU?rel=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Martti is built on the chassis of a Volkswagen Touareg. Its journey took place on an "intelligent road" known as Aurora E8. A significant aspect of VTT&apos;s AV testing involves telematic connectivity. The organization is working to develop a 5G system across Finland. By delivering a constant stream of data about road conditions, the intelligent road setup played an essential role in enabling Martti to drive in the snow. The company says it will use similar technology to empower AVs that are built to operate off-road, as well.</p><p>"We already have at our disposal an intelligent roadside unit, capable of feeding local information for the insatiable needs of Martti and Marilyn. This cart dubbed MARSU contains measuring devices for friction data and a communications module serving as a base station," VTT project manager Matti Kutila wrote in a <a href="http://www.vttresearch.com/media/news/martti-developed-for-adverse-weather-conditions-is-the-first-finnish-robot-car-to-challenge-snow-and-ice" target="new">statement</a>. "Furthermore, next spring one of our vehicles can also be spotted in forest environments, when Marilyn and Martti get a new friend capable of tackling all terrains."</p><p>Critically, Martti wasn&apos;t moving along the road at a crawl. Instead, the driverless car traveled at a speed consistent with local traffic in snowy conditions. The team at VTT believes its speed may have even been a record for a self-driving car on snow.</p><p>"It probably also made a new world record in fully automated driving, making 40 km/h [24.8 mph] in a snowfall on snow-covered terrain without lane markings," said Kutila. "It could have had even more speed, but in test driving it is programmed not to exceed the limit of 40 km/h."</p><p><a href="https://www.liikennevirasto.fi/web/en/e8-aurora" target="new">Aurora E8</a> is something of a hybrid between a normal road and a public testing ground for self-driving and connected cars, so VTT&apos;s claim that Martti was the first fully autonomous vehicle to operate in snowy conditions on a "real" road is open to some interpretation. But the work being done here is important regardless. If driverless cars are the future of transportation, they can&apos;t hibernate during the winter.

Additionally, the time saved by reducing commute times even minimally would amount to a huge societal benefit.</p><p>Driverless cars could accomplish this and more by traveling at speeds that help traffic flow more smoothly, preventing the "phantom" traffic jams that seem to develop without a clear cause. More efficient traffic flow would be further enhanced by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications that allow cars to signal their intentions to surrounding vehicles and to an overall infrastructure grid so other road actors can react accordingly.</p><p>Few countries suffer from worse traffic congestion than China.</p><p><a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2088876/chinas-more-300-million-vehicles-drive-pollution-congestion" target="new">In 2017</a>, the number of registered cars in China topped 300 million, nearly matching the number of <em>people</em> in the US.</p><p>China is home to ten of the 25 most congested cities in the world, according to the <a href="https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/" target="new">TomTom Traffic Index</a>. Self-driving cars could help ease these issues, but until now, China had prohibited testing them on public roads. But in late December, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport announced that companies that have tested driverless cars on private roads can now apply for permission to test on public roads in the Chinese capital.</p><p>In principle, the application process to test a driverless car in Beijing will work similarly to states like California. A Chinese autonomous vehicle company will need to already be registered with the government and must have already performed extensive testing at enclosed facilities. Once approved, all self-driving cars in Beijing will be required to have a human operator behind the wheel, ready to take control of the car if necessary.</p><p>Awarded permits in China will be determined by a council "made up of experts in transportation, telecommunications, automobiles, computer science, and law," Yiting Sun <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609807/china-is-opening-up-city-roads-for-driverless-cars/" target="new">reports</a> at the MIT Technology Review.

A tech giant sees the head of its self-driving car project leave to start his own autonomous vehicle company.

However, the situation that Chinese Internet behemoth <a href="http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml" target="new">Baidu</a> finds itself in is, at least in the early stages, mirroring the circumstances that played out when Waymo filed suit against its co-founder Anthony Levandowski and Uber, which acquired Levandowski&apos;s autonomous truck startup Otto. </p><p>Like Google, Baidu first became known as a search engine. But it has since emerged as a player in the autonomous vehicle space. Now, Baidu is suing the Chinese self-driving startup JingChi. JingChi was founded in April by Wang Jing, a former AV executive at Baidu.</p><p>Baidu is suing for 50 million yuan, the equivalent of about $7.6 million.</p><p>In October, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-uber-lawsuit/exclusive-alphabets-waymo-demanded-1-billion-in-settlement-talks-with-uber-sources-idUSKBN1CH0QC" target="new">Reuters</a> reported that Waymo unsuccessfully demanded $1 billion from Uber to settle its case, so Badiu&apos;s suit is significantly lower stakes from a monetary perspective. But Baidu&apos;s suit also asks JingChi to cease using any allegedly stolen technology in the development of its products. If it is determined that stolen technology is fundamental to JingChi&apos;s operations, the company could be crippled.</p><p>In a written message to the South China Morning Post, Wang denied the allegations and stated that JingChi was preparing a more formal response to the accusations.</p><p>"Baidu&apos;s lawsuit is entirely without basis. Our lawyers will respond factually and legally," Wang <a href="http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2125414/chinas-baidu-sues-its-former-driverless-car-chief-over-alleged-theft" target="new">wrote</a>. "Our headquarters will move back to China and within two weeks we will showcase our technological capabilities."</p><p>Wang also told the paper that JingChi was China&apos;s leader in self-driving car technology. That claim would find few supporters, as Baidu is by far the country&apos;s best-known AV developer. Its open source autonomous driving platform <a href="http://apollo.auto/" target="new">Apollo</a> has over 70 partners throughout various sub-sectors of connected automotives, many of them high-profile automakers. In July, Baidu <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">partnered with Microsoft</a> to leverage the American tech company&apos;s Azure cloud platform to optimize Apollo. In September, Baidu <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">unveiled Apollo 1.5</a> and is set to launch Apollo 2.0 in Las Vegas on January 8.</p><p>But perhaps there is reason for Baidu to be wary of Wang and JingChi. Less than six months into its existence, JingChi raised $52 million in a pre-A round of fundraising led by Qiming Venture and Nvidia GPU Ventures.

It would be the first company to do so anywhere, and Waymo wasn&apos;t shy in declaring wider implications for the launch of the service.</p><p>"With Waymo in the driver&apos;s seat, we can reimagine many different types of transportation, from ride-hailing and logistics, to public transport and personal vehicles, too," the company <a href="https://medium.com/waymo/with-waymo-in-the-drivers-seat-fully-self-driving-vehicles-can-transform-the-way-we-get-around-75e9622e829a" target="new">proclaimed</a>. "We&apos;ve been exploring each of these areas, with a focus on shared mobility."</p><p>Undoubtedly, 2017 was an exciting year for news surrounding the driverless car. Companies took a major step away from the theoretical and into the concrete, with the announcement of new self-driving projects with real timelines attached to them. So if 2017 was a year of telling for AV developers, 2018 will be a year of showing, according to Roberto Baldwin at Engadget.</p><p>"2017 was all about the AI hype," Baldwin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/23/self-driving-cars-2018/" target="new">wrote</a>. "In 2018, companies are going to have to start delivering on their promises to make self-driving cars a reality. Because, eventually, our lives will depend on it."</p><p>Entitled "Fragmentation in self-driving cars will eventually be a problem," Baldwin&apos;s piece is a meditation on the state of the driverless vehicle industry as the calendar turns. Baldwin believes that technological differentiation from one developer to the next could lead to a confusing and ineffective autonomous landscape.</p><p>"At some point, autonomous cars will be on the road and if there isn&apos;t a federally regulated standard governing how these vehicles interact with the world, there will be chaos as consumers, cities and automakers with competing systems follow slightly different rules," he writes. "For example, if every vehicle treated an intersection differently, the resulting chaos would be no better than when humans are behind the wheel."</p><p>But that isn&apos;t to say that governments should leap in with a series of tightly worded regulations prescribing industry best practices and laws that all cities must follow.</p><p>For the time being, the AV industry&apos;s greatest strength is its diversity. Since anyone is yet to perfect driverless car technology, we have no idea where the game-changing innovations will come from.

And if that applicant happens to be one of the world&apos;s most important tech companies, that insight becomes quite valuable indeed.</p><p>So it&apos;s no surprise that a recent patent application from <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="new">Apple</a> generated a fair amount of attention. In late December, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/21/apple-patents-navigation-system-for-self-driving-cars.html" target="new">CNBC reported</a> that the US Patent and Trademark Office had published an Apple patent application entitled "Autonomous Navigation System." The patent, which had been in the works since at least 2015, describes an autonomous system that would learn to navigate a given road autonomously by first being guided through it by a human driver.</p><p>"The vehicle includes sensor devices which monitor characteristics of the driving route based on the vehicle being navigated along the driving route," reads the <a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw" target="new">application</a>. "And an autonomous navigation system which is interoperable with the sensor devices to: implement a succession of updates to a virtual characterization of the driving route, based on monitoring a succession of manual navigations of the vehicle along the driving route, associate a confidence indicator with the virtual characterization... and enable autonomous navigation of the vehicle along the driving route."</p><p>While a "virtual characterization of [a] driving route," may sound an awful lot like the digital maps that many consider to be a fundamental component of a successful autonomous vehicle, the patent positions its technology as something of a correction to digital mapping in its current form.</p><p>"The development of such a map can require extensive expenditures of time and effort," the patent reads. "In addition... such a map can unexpectedly become obsolete and unusable for safe autonomous navigation of a route."</p><p>These are certainly valid criticisms of the limits of digital mapping for autonomous vehicles. But those holes in the capabilities of mapping are exactly why very few AV developers have chosen to build their vehicles to rely solely on mapping; most are equipped with mapping capabilities and a suite of physical sensors, each of which covers up the deficiencies of the other. And given that its "virtual characterizations" would be built off of previous trips through given stretches of road, it&apos;s unclear how such a system would be any less vulnerable to sudden obsolescence than a conventional digital map.</p><p>Regardless, the patent application signals that Apple is still very much in the autonomous vehicle game.</p><p>Even though Apple <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">scaled back</a> plans for Project Titan, an effort to develop a self-driving car from the ground up, news continues to emerge out of Cupertino about new AV developments.

In a self-driving car sector that lacks widespread industry standards, Velodyne Lidar sensors are one of the few pieces of hardware that are used by just about everyone.</p><p>Lidar sensors, which emit millions of laser pulses per second to build a virtual rendering of a physical environment, have been in use since the early 1960s. However, at the 2005 <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">DARPA Grand Challenge</a>, <a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new">Velodyne</a> Founder and CEO <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">David Hall</a> unveiled a major innovation by using a rotating Lidar device to help guide the autonomous system of a driverless car.</p><p>While the rotating Lidar mechanism was replicated by a number of AV developers in the following years, Velodyne has remained the industry leader for vehicular Lidar.</p><p>Because of its position and scale, when Velodyne makes an announcement people take notice. And Velodyne entered 2018 with a bang. On New Year&apos;s Day, the company revealed that it was halving the price of its VLP-16 sensor, its most popular Lidar system. Released in 2016 at a $8,000 price point, the VLP-16 will now cost $4,000.</p><p>"Demand for our VLP-16s grew tremendously in 2017. As a result, we increased capacity and now can pass along savings as cost reduction to our customers," Hall wrote in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180101005041/en/Velodyne-Slashes-Price-Popular-LiDAR-Sensor" target="new">statement</a>. "We want to make 2018 a year of optimism for the autonomous vehicle, especially as the first waves of robocabs hit the road. Our goal is the democratization of transportation safety by making it accessible to every man, woman, and child in the world as quickly as possible."</p><p>As its name indicates, the VLP-16 is a 16-channel Lidar.</p><p>This means it offers lower resolution and a lower level of performance than sensors with a greater number of channels, including Velodyne&apos;s own Ultra Puck VLP-32C, the HDL-64E, and the <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">recently announced</a> VLS-128. But, as Steve LeVine points out at <a href="https://www.axios.com/velodyne-has-halved-the-price-of-its-popular-self-driving-sensor-2521676329.html" target="new">Axios</a>, AV designers ranging from <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Apple</a> to robotaxi company <a href="http://zoox.com/" target="new">Zoox</a> have outfitted functional driverless prototypes with several VLP-16s to mimic the functionality of a smaller number of higher-end sensors. At its new price point, the VLP-16 becomes even more attractive option for companies in the early stages of autonomous vehicle testing.</p><p>The price reduction was enabled by the recent commencement of operations at Velodyne&apos;s new "Megafactory" in San Jose, a manufacturing facility that has made production more efficient, according to Hall.</p><p>"Since its launch, customers have been lining up to purchase the VLP-16 and we&apos;ve been able to meet that growing demand by expanding production and developing automated manufacturing for Lidar sensors at the Megafactory," he said. "With this cost reduction, we&apos;ll be able to get more Pucks into the hands of more customers, support the growing number of autonomous vehicle development fleets around the world, and start creating a better tomorrow."</p><p>Despite Velodyne&apos;s market position, it faces no shortage of competition in the emerging market from companies like <a href="https://www.ouster.io/" target="new">Ouster</a>, which <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">offers</a> a 64-channel Lidar that is smaller, lighter and more efficient than Velodyne&apos;s 64-channel offering -- and six times less expensive. But with the release of the VLS-128, Velodyne further solidified its position at the top of the market.

There are other savings, as well.</p><p>Maintenance costs can be far lower for electric vehicles than their fossil fuel-powered counterparts because EVs are comprised of fewer parts that need less frequent servicing. Plus, the environmental benefits of electric cars and their reduced greenhouse gas emissions becomes increasingly attractive as climate change weighs more heavily on corporate and consumer behavior.</p><p>But a series of roadblocks have delayed the long-awaited spread of electric vehicles over the years. Reshaping the primary energy source for the world&apos;s foremost form of transportation is no small feat, it turns out. And in a recent interview with Bloomberg, one of the inventors of the lithium-ion battery raised another issue that EV designers ought to pay close attention to. </p><p>"Cars are a completely new application, and we&apos;ll have to wait until we find out what kind of batteries will really be needed," <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-26/autonomous-cars-need-tougher-batteries-lithium-ion-pioneer-says" target="new">said</a> Akira Yoshino, who created a prototype of the lithium-ion battery in 1985. "The future of batteries depends on what will happen to the future of the automobile society."</p><p>Yoshino&apos;s concerns have to do with emerging driverless car technology, and the ways in which it may reshape vehicle ownership models.</p><p>Transportation experts expect that autonomous vehicles, which will likely be electric vehicles, will cause a shift away from individual car ownership and towards ride-hailing services offered by fleet owners. Since these driverless cars can theoretically operate 24/7, Yoshino believes that the current EV battery designs will have to change.</p><p>"A car shared by ten people means it will be running ten times more," he said. "Durability will become very important."</p><p>Working for Japanese chemical company <a href="http://www.asahi-kasei.co.jp/asahi/en/" target="new">Asahi Kasei Corp.</a> in the 1980s, Yoshino invented a lithium-ion battery prototype that used polyacetylene as the anode, enabling the small, rechargeable electronic devices that are now so central to modern life.</p><p>Electric battery concerns recently arose when <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new">Tesla</a> unveiled its <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Semi</a>, an all-electric freight truck that claimed impressive performance specs. Bloomberg reporters Tom Randall and John Lippert questioned whether Tesla will be able to live up to those promises.</p><p>"Tesla&apos;s current generation of high-speed Superchargers have a power output of 120 kilowatts and can add about 180 miles to the battery in a Model S sedan in 30 minutes. But that&apos;s for a passenger car, not a loaded truck," Randall and Lippert <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-24/tesla-s-newest-promises-break-the-laws-of-batteries" target="new">wrote</a>. "To meet Tesla&apos;s claim of 400 miles in 30 minutes for a semi carrying 80,000 pounds would require its new Megachargers to achieve output of more than 1200 kW -- or more than ten times better than Tesla&apos;s fastest chargers available today."</p><p>This would seem to support Yoshino&apos;s claim that a new battery is needed.</p><p>What isn&apos;t yet known is whether Tesla, or some other company, has already made significant strides toward creating one. While Musk is certainly given to grand talk, it&apos;s unlikely he would want to make promises he can&apos;t deliver on.

There would be a vision-obscuring blizzard making the roads slick and unreliable. Traffic would be thick and moving irregularly. Worse, the drivers around you would have seemingly little regard for your safety, or even their own. Even the road signs would be difficult to see.</p><p>Welcome to life for drivers in Moscow.</p><p>Poorly laid out roads, bad weather and not-so-cautious driving practices make for dangerous automobile treks in the Russian capital.

But the conditions in Russia are not all that different from other countries in the world, which is why autonomous developers believe that, with apologies to New York, "if they can make it there, they can make it anywhere."</p><p>A recent story in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/02/moscow-russia-self-driving-car-challenge-hackathon" target="new">The Guardian</a> by Annie Gaus documented an event spawned by this belief. At a three-day hackathon in Moscow, engineering students from around the globe and corporate sponsors like <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html" target="new">Nvidia</a> and <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="new">Uber</a> gathered to take a crack at developing autonomous systems for Moscow&apos;s roads.</p><p>"The event had another purpose: to advance a credo that when it comes to autonomous cars, tougher conditions produce smarter technology," writes Gaus. "Lidar -- the expensive, light-pulsing sensors relied upon by current autonomous car models -- is worthless in snow ... Instead, cars should be trained to operate using high-definition cameras, low-cost radars and powerful AI that mimics the human brain."</p><p>The idea that Lidar is "worthless in snow," advanced by Olga Uskova of Russian AV software developer Cognitive Technologies may be an extreme position -- nearly all driverless car manufacturers incorporate Lidar sensors in some form.</p><p>Nevertheless, Lidar does not work as effectively in the snow, and developers have relied more heavily on other hardware to navigate in adverse conditions. An <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">autonomous vehicle in Finland</a> primarily used radar sensors to complete a journey through a wintry mix.</p><p>As for the hackathon engineers in Moscow, cobbling together an autonomous driving system over the course of three sleepless days proved difficult. The top team only managed to achieve 40% accuracy in identifying road signs. The expected culprits were to blame for the difficulties: Snow-covered road signs were difficult for systems to detect, and non-Russian speakers had an even more challenging time differentiating between similar looking road signs.</p><p>While success proved elusive at the hackathon, in some ways, that was beside the point.</p><p>The fact that driverless car developers are moving beyond building cars that can work in the idealistic sunny climates of Arizona and California and shifting to the more challenging task of creating vehicles that can work in more realistic scenarios is an important sign of progress.</p><p>Many expect that self-driving cars will eventually operate 24/7, but they will only be able to do that if they can handle the weather and unique road conditions that present themselves at every moment of the day all over the world.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Autonomous Car Testing in Moscow Is Hard & Necessary' --post_excerpt='A three-day hackathon showed just how hard it is to design an autonomous system for Moscow roads.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Autonomous Car Testing in Moscow Is Hard & Necessary' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2018-01-10 08:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2018-01-10 08:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,3,6,8" --tags_input='autonomous vehicles, self-driving, driverless, Moscow, Russia, hackathon, Uber, Nvidia' --tax_input=''

"By knowing exactly who is behind the wheel, automakers can implement vehicle security, personalize the vehicle cabin, and secure access to cloud-based accounts, apps, and additional connected car services."</p><p>As Downing notes, the security advantages of this type of driver identification go beyond merely ensuring that authorized users are operating a vehicle. It can provide an additional layer of security for payment services at toll booths and gas stations. Its uses even extend into infotainment: Upon identifying a driver via a retinal scan, a connected car system could automatically implement their preferred settings for seat positioning, cabin temperature and music.</p><p>The mechanism that will trigger the retinal scan in equipped cars is slick. Once in the car, all a driver needs to do is look into the rearview mirror. Their presence will be detected, and the system will commence the scan that uses near-infrared emitters and an iris-scanning camera as hardware.</p><p>The retina scanning is only one of the new features that Gentex plans to reveal at CES. HomeLink Connect is an app that allows drivers in to control radio-frequency devices like garage doors from their car. It can even allow them to control IoT devices like connected thermostats, lighting and security systems, all from the comfort of a vehicle.</p><p>"By adding cloud-based wireless control to HomeLink&apos;s traditional [radio frequency] functionality, the feature stands to remain the industry&apos;s most versatile, reliable, and comprehensive in-vehicle home automation system," Downing noted. "It also opens the feature to new markets and new users by providing an ever-expanding number of use cases."</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Gentex Unveiling Iris-Scanning Driver Authentication at CES' --post_excerpt='In-Vehicle Biometrics are the latest in-car security technology.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Gentex Unveiling Iris-Scanning Driver Authentication at CES' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2018-01-10 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2018-01-10 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,5,8,9" --tags_input='Gentex, connected car, biometrics, HomeLink Connect, IoT' --tax_input=''

It&apos;s no secret why.</p><p>The ability to manifest a thought by simply speaking it out loud is an incredibly powerful, and frictionless, experience. You can put on your favorite music without scrolling through a streaming app. You can set up a reminder for yourself without entering it into a calendar. You can add an item to your grocery list without having a physical grocery list. You can even <em>order</em> those very groceries all by uttering a single sentence.</p><p>If you think about it, though, the home is not even the place where a voice assistant has the most potential. Sure, it&apos;s a convenience, but putting down what you&apos;re doing for a second to perform a task on your computer or phone isn&apos;t the worst thing in the world.

The South Korean automakers both plan to launch artificial intelligence-based voice assistant services in select new vehicles beginning in 2019, with a goal of including the technology in all new vehicles by the year 2025.</p><p>The automakers, which are both part of Hyundai Motor Group, are currently developing a product known as Intelligent Personal Agent that will perform tasks in and out of the vehicle, as well as give users requested information like weather and traffic conditions.</p><p>"Sophisticated voice recognition and AI integration are core to effectively providing drivers with the massive content and data that future connected vehicles have to offer," Hyundai director of infotainment development Paul Choo wrote in a <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2449" target="new">statement</a>. "These elements play a key role in delivering connected-car-generated information."</p><p>The project is a collaboration with AI company <a href="https://soundhound.com/" target="new">SoundHound</a>, and will be based upon the preexisting Houndify platform. The Houndify <a href="https://www.houndify.com/" target="new">website</a> touts capabilities like "deep meaning understanding," "conversational intelligence" and multilingual text to speech. Companies that already offer products based on the Houndify platform include Yelp, Uber and Expedia.</p><p>"We spent a decade developing Houndify, the most advanced voice AI platform, to enable partners the ability to create customized experiences for their products," SoundHound founder and CEO Keyvan Mohajer noted. "We are thrilled to work with Hyundai Motor to revolutionize the in-car experience."</p><p>Much like Amazon Echo owners get the attention of their device with the prompt of "Alexa," future Hyundai owners will activate their car&apos;s AI system with the simple phrase "Hi, Hyundai." The list of functions will be extensive. Using their voice, drivers will be able to open and close car doors and change the temperature inside the vehicle. They&apos;ll be able to control infotainment systems, setting the destination for a navigation system or queuing up a favorite podcast. They&apos;ll even be able to remotely control IoT-connected items in their home like thermostats or security systems.

This is particularly true with emerging industries where the data set around which market predictions are made is relatively small.</p><p>But hitting a number exactly on the head isn&apos;t the point of these reports. Instead, they exist to show where a particular market may be headed in broad strokes. The predictions are based on more than throwing darts at a board and even if the prophecies don&apos;t come true, they still provide a trove of useful insight.</p><p>It is through that lens that a recent report from <a href="https://ihsmarkit.com/" target="new">IHS Markit</a> should be viewed. The global information and analytics company explored the future of the self-driving car industry and forecasted that more than 33 million autonomous vehicles will be sold by 2040.

Without the need for a human driver, autonomous vehicles operating within ride-hailing services will be able to run 24/7. Fleet managers will need to take advantage of this increased uptime to justify the added expense that will come with the first wave of self-driving cars. As the technology costs come down so will vehicle costs, which will then expand the market for the driverless cars.</p><p>Autonomous vehicle sales in the US, China and Europe will account for approximately 27 million of those 33 million annual sales, according to IHS.</p><p>China is expected to be the leader in total volume at 14.5 million units, which is influenced by the fact that its enormous population could top 1.5 billion people by 2040. The US could account for 7.4 million units per year by that point, thanks to hosting the world&apos;s foremost AV developers. And while sales in Europe could be hampered by regulations that discourage ride-hailing services from operating, IHS Markit still predicts 5.5 million annual vehicle sales across the continent by 2040.</p><p>While 2040 may seem far away, IHS Markit analyst Jeremy Carlson cited <a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new">Waymo</a>&apos;s forthcoming <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">AV ride-hailing service</a> in Phoenix as evidence that many Americans will have the opportunity to ride in a driverless car much sooner.</p><p>"We as consumers are going to start to get hands-on experience much sooner than expected," Carlson told <a href="http://www.thedrive.com/sheetmetal/17298/forecast-autonomous-vehicle-sales-to-top-33-million-in-2040" target="new">The Drive</a>.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Tragically, many serious auto accidents were only milliseconds away from being prevented.</p><p>Piloting a multi-ton automobile is a game of inches, especially at high speeds. The difference between a major collision and a close call can be the amount of time between when a driver thinks about hitting the brakes or turning the wheel, and the time it takes him or her to actually do it.</p><p>Bridging such a minuscule physiological gap is a daunting challenge. But the so-called "Brain-to-Vehicle" (B2V) technology, which <a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/" target="new">Nissan</a> demonstrated for the first time at CES 2018 in Las Vegas, attempts to do just that.</p><p>The product involves brain-wave reading skullcaps, which drivers wear behind the wheel. Paired with intelligent predictive software, Nissan&apos;s B2V tech can anticipate a driver&apos;s next move, whether it be acceleration, braking or turning. The vehicle can then begin that action before the driver even hits a pedal or turns the steering wheel. Nissan claims the tech makes a difference of 0.2 to 0.5 seconds in performing a given action, "while remaining largely imperceptible."</p><p>The B2V moniker is a reference to connected car technologies like vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity. V2V connectivity allows cars to "talk" to one another on the road, telegraphing their intentions to create more predictable -- and therefore safer -- traffic patterns. V2I connectivity refers to communication between cars and a central grid to optimize on-road operations like the patterns of traffic lights. Many believe that V2X (vehicle-to-everything) connectivity will be essential to the functioning of fully self-driving cars, and Nissan claims its B2V tech will factor into that equation.</p><p>"When most people think about autonomous driving, they have a very impersonal vision of the future, where humans relinquish control to the machines. Yet B2V technology does the opposite, by using signals from their own brain to make the drive even more exciting and enjoyable," Nissan Executive Vice President Daniele Schillaci said in a <a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-3459ed449767a2e07b2e465ced0014bc-180103-01-e" target="new">statement</a>. "Through Nissan Intelligent Mobility, we are moving people to a better world by delivering more autonomy, more electrification and more connectivity."</p><p>The Nissan Intelligent Mobility program, of which B2V is a part of, is an initiative through which Nissan strives to embrace and integrate the most futuristic automotive technology into its vehicles. Other technologies that have come out of Nissan Intelligent Mobility include ProPilot Park, an advanced automated parking system, and e-Pedal, which integrates both acceleration and braking into a single pedal.</p><p>There are both limits and theoretical concerns about Nissan&apos;s B2V product.</p><p>One involves finding a home for the hardware powering the advanced technology inside the vehicle. There are also issues involved with convincing drivers to actually don a wired skullcap every time they get behind the wheel. Then there&apos;s the concern about what would happen if the technology faltered and ended up causing an accident instead of preventing one.</p><p>But as unusual as brain wave-reading hats might appear, the concept of a vehicle using biometric data to anticipate a driver&apos;s actions has enormous potential. If a vehicle can augment human capacities to allow them to perform better than they would on their own, that is certainly a technology worth exploring further.</p>' --post_content_filtered='' --post_title='Nissan&apos;s &apos;Brain-to-Vehicle&apos; Tech Wants to Predict Driver Behavior' --post_excerpt='Wired skullcaps will help Nissan vehicles predict a driver&apos;s next move.' --post_status='publish' --post_type='post' --comment_status='closed' --ping_status='open' --post_password='' --post_name='Nissan&apos;s &apos;Brain-to-Vehicle&apos; Tech Wants to Predict Driver Behavior' --to_ping='' --pinged='' --post_modified='2018-01-12 12:00:00' --post_modified_gmt='2018-01-12 12:00:00' --post_parent='0' --menu_order='0' --post_mime_type='' --guid='' --post_category="2,4,6,8" --tags_input='Nissan, Nissan Intelligent Mobility, Brain to vehicle, B2V, V2V, V2I, autonomous vehicles, self-driving, driverless' --tax_input=''

This year, Waymo will become the first company to test driverless cars on public roads without a human attendant, and the first company to launch a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">ride-hailing service</a> featuring autonomous vehicles exclusively.

But the reality is that these are multi-faceted organizations with lots of employees. And as the market for driverless cars has heated up, many of those employees have left big companies to launch their own startups.</p><p>While these startups may be smaller in size, they still have huge ambitions.</p><p>That is certainly the case with <a href="https://aurora.tech/" target="new">Aurora</a>.</p><p>The Palo Alto outfit has an impressive trio of co-founders, including former Tesla Autopilot leader Sterling Anderson, former head of Google self-driving Chris Urmson, and former Uber AV engineer Drew Bagnell.</p><p>Up until the start of the year, Aurora had been operating mostly in stealth mode, but the company kicked off 2018 with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2018/01/04/from-stealth-to-stardom-ex-google-tesla-uber-robocar-icons-snag-vw-hyundai-deals/" target="new">a major announcement</a> that it was working with both Hyundai and Volkswagen to power the automakers&apos; impending autonomous vehicle projects.</p><p>With a sparse website (motto: "We do self-driving cars") that displays a long list of <a href="https://aurora.tech/openings.html" target="new">job openings</a> in Palo Alto, San Francisco and Pittsburgh, Aurora isn&apos;t exactly shouting from the rooftops about its driverless system.</p><p>Volkswagen&apos;s announcement of its partnership with the company, though, provides an idea of what the AV veterans Anderson, Urmson and Bagnell have up their sleeves.</p><p>"Specialists from the Volkswagen Group ... have already been working intensively with experts from Aurora to integrate Aurora&apos;s self-driving system including sensors, hardware and software, such as Machine Learning and AI technology in Volkswagen Group&apos;s vehicle platforms," reads the <a href="https://media.vw.com/releases/967" target="new">release</a>. "With the customer experience at the center of this technology development, the Volkswagen Group is focused on creating new solutions, with the goal of providing best-in-class user experience with a focus on safety, convenience and usability."</p><p>Volkswagen plans to leverage Aurora&apos;s technology to build upon its <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Sedric concept</a>. First unveiled in March of 2017, Sedric will represent a "family" of fully autonomous vehicles of various purposes.</p><p>While Aurora&apos;s work with Volkswagen reportedly has been ongoing for about a year, the company&apos;s engagement with Hyundai is a more recent development. Hyundai says its goal in working with Aurora is to have Level 4 autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021.</p><p>At Level 4 autonomy, a driverless system is expected to complete the entirety of most standard drives on its own.</p><p>The question that remains is how close is Aurora to catching its founders&apos; former employers. The Volkswagen and Hyundai news is certainly encouraging. In the future it may not be necessary, or even desirable, for every automaker to have its own autonomous vehicle platform. So collaborating with a third party that provides off-the-shelf solutions like Aurora makes a lot of sense. Volkswagen, for one, seems to see this as just the beginning of an ongoing and fruitful relationship.</p><p>"Long-term probably only a handful of companies will actually be setting the standard and developing a self-driving system which actually can be delivered into many OEM&apos;s vehicles.

Users earned the nickname "Glassholes," and the nerdy aesthetic of the glasses made it so few people were particularly enthusiastic about wearing them in public.</p><p>Google Glass never became the ubiquitous wearable the company expected. (The wearable did, however, find a <a href="https://www.x.company/glass/" target="new">second life</a> as a high-tech industrial tool.)</p><p>One moral of the story is this: Design matters. A lot.</p><p>Right now, most autonomous vehicles feature hulking sensor suites on their roofs. Developers are more focused on making sure the sensors and other technology actually work than with aesthetics.</P><p>That is fine in the early stages of the development process. But at a certain point in the not too distant future, the look of an autonomous vehicle is going to play an increasingly important role in customers&apos; decisions.</p><p>The latest driverless prototype from the <a href="http://www.tri.global/" target="new">Toyota Research Institute</a> (TRI) embraces this idea. At CES, Toyota unveiled a sleek Platform 3.0 autonomous concept vehicle that looks markedly different from other self-driving cars.</p><p>Built on the body of a Lexus LS 600hL, Platform 3.0 is founded upon three core principles: Industry-leading performance, a design that can be reproduced at scale and a distinct, sleek design that consumers want to be seen in.</p><p>"Our team has once again rapidly advanced our automated vehicle research capabilities," TRI CEO Gill Pratt wrote in a <a href="http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+research+institute+introduces+next+generation+automated+driving+research+vehicle+ces.htm" target="new">statement</a>.

They dubbed their philosophy "intelligent minimalism," using available sunroof space to lower the overall height of the car&apos;s embedded sensor systems.</p><p>"Automotive designers&apos; roles have been pivoting toward thinking deeper and greater on how to design and apply automated driving technology for drivers and passengers," Scott Roller, senior lead designer at CALTY, noted in the release. "It&apos;s exciting to integrate the components in harmony with the car&apos;s design."</p><p>Platform 3.0 is more than just a design exercise. The concept car boasts performance benchmarks like 360-degree perception that extends 200 meters, and Lidar design and positioning that makes it easier for the vehicle to detect dark objects, small objects and low-level objects.</p><p>While plenty of autonomous driving concepts were paraded around at CES this year, few were as pretty as TRI&apos;s Platform 3.0.

At CES, Huang announced that Nvidia now has a staggering 320 partnerships with other companies in the self-driving car category. While many of the collaborations were previously known, this was the first time Nvidia itself had released a complete tally of them all.</p><p>Nvidia also took the opportunity to announce four more collaborations. The company revealed new deals with <a href="http://uber.com/" target="new">Uber</a>, <a href="http://volkswagen.com/en.html" target="new">Volkswagen</a>, <a href="https://www.zf.com/corporate/en_de/homepage/homepage.html" target="new">ZF</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Baidu_Inc" target="new">Baidu</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index" target="new">Mercedes-Benz</a>.</p><p>When Uber first launched its self-driving Volvo XC90s on Pittsburgh roads in 2015, it used Nvidia GPU computing technology. Now as Uber expands its fleet of self-driving cars and fleet trucks, it will continue to utilize Nvidia technology.</p><p>Volkswagen plans to leverage the Nvidia Drive IX platform, an AI software development kit, to transform cockpit experiences for drivers and create improved safety features. Features built through Nvidia Drive IX will be incorporated in the forthcoming I.D. Bus, Volkswagen&apos;s electric, AI-infused re-imagining of the classic VW Microbus.</p><p>"Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the car," <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/volkswagen-and-nvidia-to-infuse-ai-into-future-vehicle-lineup" target="new">noted</a> Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess. "Autonomous driving, zero-emission mobility and digital networking are virtually impossible without advances in AI and deep learning. Combining the imagination of Volkswagen with Nvidia, the leader in AI technology, enables us to take a big step into the future."</p><p>The Nvidia-ZF-Baidu project is a tricontinental one, as the California software company will be working with the German auto supplier and the Chinese tech giant to combine their proprietary AV technologies to build a single China-specific autonomous vehicle platform. The technologies involved are ZF&apos;s ProAI car computer, Baidu&apos;s Apollo open driverless platform, and the newly announced Nvidia Drive Xavier, an autonomous machine processor.</p><p>Nvidia also announced a deal with Mercedes-Benz. Similar to its project with Volkswagen, Nvidia is partnering with Mercedes-Benz to build a new vehicle cockpit experience, known as MBUX, designed for the driverless age.</p><p>"I want to build the world&apos;s most advanced cockpit of the future and it&apos;s going to have amazing computer graphics but most important is that it will have artificial intelligence so it can revolutionize the user experience," <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/01/09/mercedes-ces-2018/" target="new">said</a> Huang.</p><p>It&apos;s an overwhelming list of projects for Nvidia, and one that will require time to fully work through.

"Inviting color concepts, luxury materials and traditional craftsmanship blend with flair to give a bespoke lounge experience. All our seats are designed to be individually adjustable so you can stay cozy at all times."</p><p>Byton is currently manufacturing an intelligent electric car in Nanjing that will first be made available in China in 2019, and then in the US and Europe in 2020.</p><p>Subsequent vehicles expected from Byton include a sedan and a multi-purpose vehicle, which figure to include certain design elements from the Concept. While some of the vehicle&apos;s more opulent features may seem excessive, they&apos;re tailored to a specific market.</p><p>"Driving is not always very pleasureful in China, and most of the time you&apos;re not moving," Byton executive director of UI design Wolfram Luchner told Sean O&apos;Kane of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/1/9/16867332/byton-electric-ev-car-ride-first-look-test-touchscreen-ces-2018" target="new">The Verge</a>. "If you spend four or five hours a day in traffic, you&apos;ll want these comforts."</p><p>The Byton Concept is equipped with several other cool features.</p><p>The dashboard-spanning screen is joined by a small eight-inch screen mounted right into the center of the steering wheel. The Byton Life Cloud Platform can sync contacts, apps and files from your smartphone with the vehicle&apos;s operating system. And keys aren&apos;t even necessary, as facial recognition cameras can provide access to the vehicle.</p><p>Like all concept cars, the Byton Concept has design and operational elements that will likely never make it into a consumer vehicle.

Someone riding in a Configurable Entertainment-equipped car could use JBL audio while gaming, or Harman Kardon audio while listening to music thanks to "shape-shifting speakers" that sound more like a Transformer than an audio component.</p><p>"In-vehicle speakers transform in real-time to provide different experiences in line with user preferences," according to the release. "A unique sound bar or tweeter can dynamically morph from one audio brand experience to another, both sonically and visually."</p><p>Moodscape is designed for passengers who are feeling stressed, contemplative, tired or energetic. Citing growing consumer interest in the "wellness" space, Harman developed Moodscape to adjust the emotions of a passenger. A feature known as Music Motivator "identifies GPS routes and analyzes available biometric feedback to build and deliver an audio experience based on passengers&apos; whereabouts, schedule and energy level."</p><p>Perhaps the coolest feature of Moodscape is the so-called QLED MoodRoof, which projects an immersive environment onto the car&apos;s internal ceiling. While you actually may be riding through downtown Boston, MoodRoof can make it feel as if you&apos;re being guided through a snowy forest or a sunny beach town depending on your preferences.</p><p>Part of the joy of driving home after a long day is being in your own personal space.

To reach that point faster, we should accelerate the rate of introduction of AVs onto our roads now so that it will take less time for them to be perfected.</p><p>The opposing viewpoint is that it is unethical to rush self-driving cars onto public roads before they&apos;re fully developed. The obvious reason is that it could put people&apos;s lives in danger. But a secondary explanation is that if imperfect driverless cars are introduced too early, it could damage the reputation of driverless cars down the road, thus limiting their future potential.</p><p>Of course, no one thinks that an underdeveloped driverless car should be recklessly testing in actual public traffic, but the debate about release timelines continues to dominate the world of autonomous vehicles.</p><p>In a speech at the Detroit Auto Show on earlier this month, US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao straddled the line between enthusiasm for the development of autonomous vehicles and caution in their development. She also announced a new set of AV guidelines, which she referred to as AV 3.0, that will be released in the summer.</p><p>The guidelines, Chao said, won&apos;t focus exclusively on driverless cars -- they&apos;ll address all forms of vehicular autonomy.</p><p>"AV 3.0 will include guidance for more than just automobiles," Chao <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/detroit-auto-show" target="new">said</a>. "It will address barriers to the safe integration of autonomous technology for motor carriers, transit, trucks, infrastructure and other modes, as well. The Department will update this guidance as often as needed. That&apos;s part of our commitment to streamline the process and to keep pace with innovation."</p><p>It was only in September, when the DOT released its last iteration of these guidelines, called "<a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">A Vision for Safety 2.0</a>." Those followed the inaugural guidelines that were released a year earlier. In her remarks, Chao said that this frequent updating was a reflection of the fast-moving development of technology in the AV space.</p><p>Chao also addressed the frequently discussed issue surrounding the impact self-driving cars could have on professional drivers and their job security. Some analysts believe that tens of thousands of people could lose their jobs. In Detroit, Chao lauded the Auto Show for partnering with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to host the first-ever Future Automotive Career Exposition at the event.</p><p>Ultimately, Chao aligned the DOT with the belief that eliminating barriers to AV deployment is the greatest means of promoting automotive safety at large.</p><p>"At the US Department of Transportation, safety will always be our number one priority," she said.

That&apos;s an area that&apos;s still for the most part reserved for the big boys.</p><p>It&apos;s no coincidence that the companies taking on this challenge are traditional automakers. Even a self-driving heavyweight like Waymo still relies on a fleet of minivans produced by Chrysler.

It was recently announced that Pony.ai received a whopping $112 million in financing for its Series A round.</p><p>The fundraising was led by Morningside Venture Capital and Legend Capital, each of which has a primary focus on Chinese investments. (Pony.ai is "co-located" in Silicon Valley and Beijing.) Also participating in the round were Sequoia China, IDG Capital, Hongtai Capital, Legend Star, Puhua Capital, Polaris Capital, DCM Ventures, Comcast Ventures and Silicon Valley Future Capital. As the size of the investment suggests, these partners believe that Pony.ai has a chance to make an enormous splash in the autonomous vehicle space.</p><p>"Pony.ai is one of the very few companies we&apos;ve seen that possesses the critical success factors: a team with a proven track record and extremely well-rounded technical expertise from both research and industry backgrounds," Legend Capital managing director Wenji Jin noted in a <a href="https://nbherard.com/business/autonomous-driving-startup-pony-ai-raises-112m/55555" target="_blank">statement</a>. "From product definition and systems integration to artificial intelligence, Pony.ai is the leader in this nascent industry. I believe Pony.ai holds the most promise in delivering [Level 4 vehicular autonomy] technology to the mass market."</p><p>The company&apos;s co-founders do indeed have an impressive pedigree. Co-founder and CTO Tiancheng Lou worked on Google&apos;s self-driving car project before it was spun off into what is now Waymo. Co-founder and CEO James Peng was a founding member of Baidu&apos;s autonomous driving team.</p><p>Pony.ai will use the Series A funding to launch an autonomous fleet in Guangzhou, China, where the company has an office. Before that, though, he says the company has some testing to do to ensure its vehicles can coexist with human-driven cars in real-world scenarios, according to Peng.</p><p>"I think in the grand scheme of things the biggest challenge is still the uncertainty in the open driving environment," Peng told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/15/one-year-old-pony-ai-raises-112-million-series-a-to-build-autonomous-car-future/" target="new">TechCrunch</a>.

Foremost among them is safety.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">oft-cited estimate</a> is that driverless cars will eventually reduce on-road fatalities by 90%. The 24/7 availability of autonomous ride-hailing fleets will also make our lives more convenient, and perhaps less expensive as we transition away from individual ownership of vehicles. </p><p>Another major benefit is accessibility.</p><p>Underserved populations such as the blind and the elderly, who are often isolated due to their inability to drive, could dramatically improve their lives with greater mobility options.</p><p>This has been a prominent feature of autonomous vehicle legislation in the US.

That is exactly what self-driving taxi company <a href="https://voyage.auto/" target="new">Voyage</a> has done in Florida, where it announced it will be bringing a ride-hailing fleet to service the 125,000-person retirement community of The Villages. With over 750 miles of road and three distinct downtowns, The Villages offers great variety to its residents. And with Voyage&apos;s fleet of robotaxis, they&apos;ll have easy, autonomous access to all of it.</p><p>Residents of The Villages will first need to download the Voyage rider app, which features an interface not unlike that of Uber or Lyft. They can then order a Voyage self-driving car to come pick them up, and enter in their destination. After they&apos;ve completed their trip -- perhaps shopping at one of The Villages&apos; eight grocery stores, or catching a movie at one of its three theaters -- they can order another Voyage ride to take them home. It&apos;s like a standard ride-hailing service, except the car is driving itself.</p><p>The Villages, Florida, is actually Voyage&apos;s second pilot community for this type of project. The first was another The Villages community in San Jose, Calif. In a New York Times article, one former board president at The Villages in San Jose described accidents caused by elderly drivers in the community that involved cars ending up in ponds and tennis courts.</p><p>"The driverless car would be far less risky than the drivers that we currently have," he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/technology/driverless-cars-testing.html" target="new">said</a>.</p><p>To generate HD maps for all 750 miles of roads within The Villages that can be read by the autonomous taxis, Voyage has partnered with <a href="https://www.carmera.com/" target="new">Carmera</a>. Carmera will not only render initial maps of the entire community, but also continuously update them via data accrued from sensors on the Voyage vehicles.</p><p>Voyage also announced that it had completed a Series A round of fundraising, bringing its fundraising total in 2017 to over $20 million.

Of course, "self-driving cars with fully alert engineer attendants" doesn&apos;t quite have the same ring to it.</p><p>But the day of truly "driverless" cars is approaching. <a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/" target="new">Uber</a>, which has been a leader in the development of autonomous ride-hailing fleets, recently claimed that it was getting close to launching autonomous vehicles that could operate without a human backup. Eric Meyhofer, head of Uber&apos;s Advanced Technology Group that oversees self-driving cars, told the Associated Press that the company would put the monitor-free cars on roads once it felt it was completely safe to do so.</p><p>"Once we can check that box, which we call passing the robot driver&apos;s license test, that&apos;s when we can remove the vehicle operator," Meyhofer <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2018-01-17/uber-close-to-scrapping-human-backups-in-self-driving-cars" target="new">said</a>. "We&apos;re going aggressively too."</p><p>Uber does seem to have made significant strides recently. It was only in October that Uber said it would <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">remove a passenger&apos;s seat operator</a> from its self-driving vehicles, leaving only one human operator in the driver&apos;s seat.

In November, the company divulged that it had <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">already launched</a> truly driverless cars around Phoenix, where it does much of its testing. It also released plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in that very area in 2018.</p><p>Uber, of course, is currently embroiled in a lawsuit filed by Waymo, alleging that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski stole thousands of proprietary files from the Google spin-off and brought them to Uber, where he went to work soon after. Late last year, a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">letter</a> emerged in the case that described unethical work practices at Uber, including the use of "stolen Waymo trade secrets." While the case figures to drag on for far longer than anyone would like it to, it has already contributed to a significant decline in Uber&apos;s reputation.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear whether deploying a fully driverless fleet will improve that reputation.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Two startups this week took on autonomous local delivery, a service that could become one of the early commercial uses of self-driving vehicles.</p><p>On January 30, <a href="https://www.udelv.com/" target="new">Udelv</a> sent a small self-driving van on a short loop through suburban San Mateo, Calif., to demonstrate a planned delivery service for grocery stores and other retailers. A grocer who participated in the demonstration said Udelv&apos;s vans and ordering software could cut delivery costs in half and give customers a better idea of when their orders will arrive. </p><p>Also on Tuesday, Silicon Valley startup <a href="https://nuro.ai/" target="new">Nuro</a> unveiled an even smaller autonomous delivery vehicle with no driver&apos;s seat or steering wheel. It&apos;s designed for neighborhood streets and is about half the width of a typical passenger car. The company also announced it has raised $92 million in two Series A rounds of funding. </p> <p>Udelv and Nuro are the latest entrants into the last-mile delivery business, which has grown with the rise of online shopping. E-commerce giants and startups alike are looking at new technologies like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?node=8037720011" target="new">drones and sidewalk-roaming <a href="https://www.starship.xyz/" target="new">robots</a> to cut costs and delivery times, but the task may also be well suited to autonomous vehicles on the street.</p> <p>In Udelv&apos;s demonstration on Tuesday, its autonomous van made what the company called the world&apos;s first such delivery run on public roads. It covered a 2.5-mile route from Draeger&apos;s, a local market, to two nearby customers. As required by California law, a safety driver was at the wheel to take over if necessary, but the drive went flawlessly, Udelv said. </p> <p>The startup, based in the neighboring town of Burlingame, designs and builds the vans itself using an electric drivetrain, chassis, sensors and other components from third parties. It won&apos;t sell the vehicles but offer delivery as a service to companies. The vehicle has a conventional cab and can be driven manually, or even remotely over a cellular connection, Udelv CEO Daniel Laury said. Its cargo space is divided into separate compartments, each with its own door that customers can unlock with their phones using Udelv&apos;s app.</p> <p>The van&apos;s limited mission made it easier to develop than self-driving cars designed for passengers, Laury said. The vehicle is designed exclusively for local deliveries, with a top speed of 25 MPH. It didn&apos;t have to be designed for a comfortable ride or to deal with all possible driving and weather conditions that a long-range vehicle might run into. The van can go 60 miles between charges. It took about two years to develop, Laury said.</p> <p>Unlike the major auto manufacturers, Udelv can start small, he said.</p> <p> "There is a tremendous amount of business that we can do in states... that have great weather conditions, that have very nice roads, that have good driving policies," Laury told The Connected Car. "I don&apos;t see a Ford or a General Motors, or one of those large OEMs manufacturing a car for just California, for example."</p><p>Udelv plans to put dozens of vans on the road this year in the San Francisco Bay Area. Under current state law, it can operate them autonomously in test mode with a safety driver as long as they&apos;re not making deliveries. The vans can also be used for deliveries as long as they&apos;re manually driven, Laury said. </p><p>The San Mateo demonstration was done in conjunction with Draeger&apos;s, a small chain of upscale markets in the Bay Area, and Delivery Guys, which does deliveries for Draeger&apos;s. </p> <p>Udelv should help Draeger&apos;s compete with big online retailers and with stores that use services like Instacart, said Richard Draeger, the owner of the chain. </p><p>Both Udelv&apos;s ordering platform and its driverless vans should make deliveries cheaper and more efficient, Draeger said. He predicts the cost of a delivery will be cut at least in half, and even more once the service is running at full volume. </p> <p>"That is the biggest hurdle for delivery going mainstream," Draeger said. </p><p>Also, the current four-hour delivery window that customers get can be cut to one or two hours because Udelv&apos;s app and back-end software will streamline the process, he said. </p> <p>One thing a self-driving van can&apos;t do is bring groceries to the customer&apos;s door. That&apos;s a tradeoff, but with a shorter time window, they&apos;ll be more willing to stay home and wait for the van to arrive, Draeger said. </p> <p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>The celebrated court battle between autonomous driving hopefuls Waymo and Uber will finally begin on Monday, February 5. After nearly a year of accusations and revelations, a federal jury will hear the opening arguments in a case that could reshape the self-driving car industry.</p><p>The trial, under US District Court Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, is expected to last three weeks and might see Uber founder Travis Kalanick, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and other well known Silicon Valley names take the stand. </p> <p>Waymo&apos;s stark <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7dzPLynxaXuQjY3dkllZ2ZKb0k/view" target="new">allegations</a>, an apparent criminal probe, and the shake-up that has since rocked Uber, have brought rapt attention to the case. But what&apos;s fueling the fight is the global competition to corner what may become a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/passenger-economy-report-infographic.html" target="new">$7 trillion industry</a> by 2050. The suit could knock Uber back in a race that has drawn in the world&apos;s biggest automakers and tech companies as well as countless startups. </p> <p>At the heart of the case is the idea that Waymo developed important technologies first and Uber -- which didn&apos;t launch its self-driving project until 2015 -- stole its work to catch up. </p> <p>Waymo, formerly Google&apos;s self-driving car project and now a division of Alphabet, is testing autonomous Chrysler Pacific minivans in at least three cities and plans to commercially launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Phoenix this year. In the past week, the company announced it would order thousands more of the vans. <a href="https://www.navigantresearch.com/research/navigant-research-leaderboard-automated-driving-vehicles" target="new">Navigant Research</a> recently ranked Waymo among the top companies in the business, just behind General Motors.</p><p>Uber began offering test rides in self-driving cars in Pittsburgh last year and has said it will <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">soon be able to operate cars without safety drivers</a>. But the Navigant report ranked it as an industry challenger, two rungs below Waymo. </p><p>Google jumped on autonomous driving earlier than many, launching its self-driving car project in 2009. Former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski worked there, then left to form the autonomous truck startup Otto in 2016. Waymo alleges that before he left, Levandowski used special software on his laptop to get into Waymo&apos;s design server and download more than 14,000 confidential files about the company&apos;s Lidar designs. </p> <p>Other Waymo engineers who later worked for Levandowski at Otto also stole secrets, the suit charges. Waymo alleges that when Uber acquired Otto later that year, partly for its Lidar system, what it really got was technology stolen from Waymo. Lidar, which uses lasers to sense cars, people, and objects around a vehicle, is a critical component in most autonomous vehicles and the focus of a race to <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">boost resolution</a> and cut size and cost. </p> <p>Waymo says it discovered Uber was using its Lidar designs when it was accidentally copied in on an e-mail from one of Uber&apos;s Lidar component providers. </p><p>"Otto and Uber have taken Waymo&apos;s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology," the complaint said. </p><p>Uber promptly <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-shoots-down-googles-claims-of-stolen-self-driving-tech-2017-2" target="new">denied</a> the charges and called the suit "a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." </p><p>After filing the suit on February 23, 2017, Waymo asked Judge Alsup to halt Uber&apos;s self-driving initiative until the case could be decided. In May, the judge declined to shut down the project but ordered Levandowski not to work on any Lidar-related projects. </p><p>Late last year, a letter to Alsup <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/doj-confirms-new-criminal-probe-linked-to-waymo-v-uber-lawsuit/" target="new">revealed</a> that federal prosecutors were conducting a criminal investigation related to Uber&apos;s acquisition of Otto. It said they were looking into the possibility that Kalanick and Levandowski used "non-attributable electronic devices" to communicate outside of Uber&apos;s official systems. </p><p>Preparations for the trial have played out against the backdrop of a shake-up at Uber that forced Kalanick out as CEO and altered the company&apos;s board. Among the triggers were controversy over allegations of sexual harassment and underhanded surveillance practices at the company. </p><p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Uber chose cheating over innovation to catch up in a breakneck race toward self-driving cars, lawyers for rival Waymo charged Monday in opening arguments for its trade-secrets lawsuit against the ride-hailing giant.</p> <p>The company that grew out of Google&apos;s autonomous car project fingered Uber founder Travis Kalanick as the prime culprit in the alleged theft of 14,000 confidential Google documents by former star engineer Anthony Levandowski, whom both sides called a key figure in the development of Lidar technology for automotive vision. </p> <p>Kalanick "made a decision that winning was more important than obeying the law," said Waymo&apos;s lead attorney, Charles Verhoeven of the firm Quinn Emmanuel. He compared the former Uber CEO to a <a href="http://archive.boston.com/sports/blogs/shesgamesports/2013/03/where-are-they-now-rosie-ruiz-and-the-man-who-uncovered-her-ruse.html" target="new">marathon runner</a> who secretly takes the subway.</p> <p>Uber, for its part, charged that Waymo was the company falling behind and that it sued Uber to stall its biggest rival. Levandowski brought nothing to Uber that wasn&apos;t commonly known among Lidar engineers, attorney Bill Carmody of Susman Godfrey said in Uber&apos;s opening argument. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">jury trial</a> before Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco has put self-driving technology in the spotlight and Silicon Valley culture under the microscope. The opening arguments drew one of the biggest media throngs of any tech trial in recent memory, partly because Uber and Alphabet, the parent company of Google and Waymo, are among the most closely watched in the tech world. </p> <p>Even before the jury was seated on February 5, Alsup made it clear tech-star privilege would have no place in his court. One witness who had requested a private room at the courthouse wasn&apos;t going to get it, he said. "You&apos;re going to have to be just like the rest of us," Alsup said. </p> <p>The eight alleged secrets at issue in the case involve Lidar, the system most self-driving cars use to sense their surroundings by constantly bouncing laser beams off of objects. </p><p>"We paint the world with these beams of light and figure out where things are very precisely," Waymo CEO John Krafcik said on the witness stand Monday. </p> <p>Levandowski led Google&apos;s development of Lidar until he resigned in late January 2016 for autonomous trucking startup Otto, which was founded a few days later. Otto publicly launched in May 2016 and was acquired by Uber in August, but Waymo charged that Levandowski was frequently in contact with Uber before Otto had even taken shape. </p> <p>The plan all along was for Uber to "acqui-hire" Levandowski and other top Google engineers for their expertise and trade secrets they knew, Waymo&apos;s Verhoeven said, citing Uber meeting notes and other documents. The code name for this project? A dollar sign. </p><p>As part of the deal, Uber agreed to indemnify Levandowski and other top hires against allegations of intellectual property theft, Verhoeven said. </p> <p>Krafcik, the first witness to take the stand, recalled taking over Google&apos;s car project in September 2015 and trying to get to know Levandowski better. "He was an interesting character," said Krafcik, a longtime automotive engineer and executive. </p><p>The two had different ideas about safety, with Levandowski opposed to Krafcik&apos;s insistence on including backup steering and braking systems in its self-driving vehicles, he said. But Levandowski&apos;s resignation the following January came as a surprise, Krafcik said. </p> <p>"He had gone from someone I had considered a friend to someone I considered an enemy," he said. </p> <p>Uber argued it took extraordinary measures to ensure it hadn&apos;t acquired any trade secrets after it acquired Otto. A forensics firm interviewed the new employees and examined the data on their personal devices, Carmody said. Waymo itself came to Uber 11 times to check its servers for proprietary information, he said. </p><p>What Waymo calls secrets are common Lidar knowledge that Google had considered posting publicly, Uber said. The company came by its core technology legitimately by hiring a team of engineers from Carnegie-Mellon University and other elsewhere. </p> <p>"The tech here tells the truth," Carmody said. "What&apos;s in here comes from people at Uber who bring to bear their engineering talents." </p> <p>The trial is expected to continue for about three weeks. Kalanick and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are among the possible witnesses.</p><p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Even among eccentric tech executives, Tesla CEO and Chief Designer Elon Musk stands out. On Tuesday, while Waymo and Uber spent another day squabbling over alleged theft of trade secrets, Musk took the high road -- 400 million miles high, eventually.</p><p>A test launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket designed and built by SpaceX, Musk&apos;s aerospace startup, carried the Tesla founder&apos;s personal Tesla Roadster out beyond the bonds of Earth to eventually orbit around the sun. </p><p>The sports car in Midnight Cherry, an example of the electric car maker&apos;s first model, made from 2008 to 2012, isn&apos;t quite driverless: It&apos;s carrying a space-suited dummy named Starman, in a pleasure-driving pose with one arm resting on top of the convertible&apos;s door. (The space suit is SpaceX&apos;s own design.) But if the journey goes as planned, the car will find its way around the sun and past Earth and Mars, as long as the hardware and the laws of physics last.</p><p>Its estimated range of 200 miles on a charge only applies on Earth. </p> <p>On board the car is also a toy Roadster with its own tiny astronaut, as well as an optical storage device containing Isaac Asimov&apos;s <i>Foundation</i> trilogy of sci-fi novels and a plaque with the names of more than 6,000 SpaceX employees, SpaceX said during a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="new">livestream</a> of the launch. </p> <p>SpaceX is streaming <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXxyXggQenJM" target="new">live views</a> of the Roadster online.</p><p>The Roadster isn&apos;t the first electric car to leave Earth, as <a href="https://www.space.com/39606-spacex-falcon-heavy-fourth-car-space.html" target="new">Space.com</a> points out. The three lunar rovers used on NASA&apos;s Apollo missions got there first. </p><p>The main purpose of the February 6 test launch is to find out how the Falcon Heavy performs. Every rocket needs a payload for realistic testing, and usually it&apos;s just a block of cement or some other weighty object that can be placed where the crew or cargo would go. Musk, who no doubt is getting ready to replace his Roadster with one from the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/roadster" target="new">new batch</a> due in 2020 anyway, is just using a payload with a bit more flair. </p> <p>The car&apos;s svelte 2,700-pound curb weight doesn&apos;t even begin to simulate all that the Falcon Heavy can carry. It&apos;s powerful enough to lift nearly 64 metric tons, or the weight of a fully loaded Boeing 737, into orbit, according to SpaceX. Only the Saturn V, used for the Apollo moon missions in the 1960s and 1970s, has had a greater carrying capacity. </p><p>SpaceX calls the Falcon Heavy the most powerful operational rocket in the world, with more than 5 million pounds of thrust at lift-off, equal to the power of 18 Boeing 747s. Its three rocket cores contain 27 engines. </p><p>The Falcon Heavy took off from Launch Complex 39A NASA&apos;s Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral, Fla., the same launchpad the Saturn V used. But unlike the classic NASA rocket, the Falcon Heavy sent at least two of its giant lower stages back to Earth. Those two stages had come back from earlier SpaceX launches and returned together to their designated landing pads to be reused again. </p> <p>Another stage of the rocket was designed to land on an autonomous barge off the Florida coast. It wasn&apos;t clear late Monday whether that maneuver had worked. </p> <p>SpaceX built the Falcon Heavy so it could launch bigger satellites and future manned spacecraft. It has already launched multiple supply missions to the International Space Station. Musk&apos;s goal is to eventually mount a mission to Mars. </p> <p>The roadster&apos;s trip, which will take it as far as 400 million  kilometers away from Earth at speeds up to 40,000km per hour, may last a billion years, SpaceX says. By then, everyone who pre-ordered a Tesla Model 3 may actually have their cars. </p><p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Uber repeatedly tried to partner with Google for years before the companies ended up as fierce rivals for the future of autonomous cars, Uber founder Travis Kalanick told a jury in San Francisco on Wednesday.</p><p>As early as 2013, Uber talked to Google about pairing its ride-hailing prowess with the larger company&apos;s self-driving car technology, Kalanick said. But over time, it proved hard to get the attention of his contact, Google co-founder Larry Page.</p><p>Tension grew as the two companies&apos; car projects started to overlap. </p> <p>"It was kind of like a little brother with a big brother," Kalanick said of the companies&apos; relationship. He testified Wednesday morning on the third day of a trade-secrets trial between Uber and Waymo -- the company that grew out of Google&apos;s self-driving car effort. Waymo has accused Uber of stealing eight key pieces of its intellectual property by acquiring a startup founded by former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski. The self-driving car company, a division of Google parent Alphabet, is seeking $1.8 billion in damages. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="new">sometimes hot-headed</a> Kalanick seemed calm and mostly at ease as he answered questions on the stand for nearly two hours on February 7, his second and last day of testimony.</p><p>Late in the summer of 2013, Google invited Uber to work with its autonomous car project, Kalanick said. Google picked him up in one of its early self-driving cars. "I&apos;m like &apos;That&apos;s pretty cool,&apos;" Kalanick recalled. But Google wasn&apos;t willing to give as much time to the partnership as Uber wanted, he said. </p> <p>So starting in early 2015, Uber began to hire dozens of engineers from the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh to launch its own self-driving project. That got Google&apos;s attention. </p><p>"Larry was very upset with us about us acquiring the CMU team and starting the autonomy effort ourselves," Kalanick said. "He was a little angry and said, &apos;Why are you doing my thing?&apos;" Put another way, "Generally, Google was super unhappy, unpumped, about us doing this," he said. </p><p>Those hirings gave Uber an advantage over Google that only grew after Uber attracted Levandowski and other Google employees, Uber&apos;s lawyers have argued. They say Waymo is suing because it can&apos;t keep up. </p> <p>Kalanick had a phone call with Page in October 2016, after Uber acquired of Levandowski&apos;s startup, called Otto. He said Page complained, "You&apos;re taking our people. You&apos;re taking our IP." Kalanick said he told Page that Uber had a process to make sure it wasn&apos;t stealing Google&apos;s intellectual property. </p><p>Under questioning from an attorney for Uber, Karen Dunn of the firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner, Kalanick said Uber hired Levandowski in 2016 for his brains, not trade secrets.</p><p>"We hired Anthony because we felt that he was incredibly visionary, a very good technologist, and he was also very charming," Kalanick said. For one thing, Levandowski had a vision of what autonomous ride-hailing fleets could mean for cities of the future. </p><p>Kalanick also testified that Lidar, the laser-based vision system used in both Google&apos;s and Uber&apos;s vehicles, was only part of what Uber was seeking when it acquired Otto for $592 million. Waymo has said its former employee took its secret Lidar designs to Uber, which then duplicated them. </p> <p>Under questioning by Waymo&apos;s attorney, Charles Verhoeven of Quinn Emmanuel, Kalanick admitted that he went ahead with the Otto acquisition knowing Waymo might sue alleging intellectual-property theft.</p><p>At Levandowski&apos;s request, Uber eventually agreed to indemnify him against such a lawsuit. </p> <p>He also admitted that he never read a due-diligence report that Uber ordered from a forensics firm to ensure it didn&apos;t receive any trade secrets through the acquisition. Kalanick said he signs hundreds of documents every day and doesn&apos;t have time to read everything. </p><pPKalanick&apos;s testimony on Wednesday shed light on Silicon Valley&apos;s rough-and-tumble culture through the eyes of one of its most legendary -- or notorious -- executives. </p> <p>Waymo&apos;s Verhoeven questioned Kalanick over many texts he exchanged with Levandowski in the months leading up to the Otto acquisition. One text from Levandowski simply said, "Burn the village." Another Uber executive&apos;s notes from a meeting showed Kalanick saying, "The golden time is over. It is war time." Asked about this quote, he told Verhoeven, "It sounds like something I would say." </p> <p>Another text that Levandowski sent as Uber considered acquiring his company said, "Here&apos;s the speech you need to give," followed by a "wink" emoji and a YouTube link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="new">"greed is good"</a> monologue from the 1987 film <i>Wall Street</i>.</p> <p>Tech slang is also playing a role in the case. Notes from one Uber meeting showed Kalanick saying the company should get "cheat codes" for self-driving technology. </p> <p>Verhoeven characterized "cheat codes" as codes designed to allow gamers to advance to the next level without earning points through the game to get there. But at one point in court, Kalanick defined the term another way, as anything that lets someone avoid a task or investment. He said one example of a "cheat code" might be Uber collecting real-time motion data from its cars as they stop and start at traffic lights. In aggregate, that data could allow Uber to tell what lights were red or green all across a city without having to install cameras to watch the lights. The data could be used for route planning and other applications. </p><p>The trial before Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco continues Thursday and is expected to last about three weeks. </p> <p>(<i>Image: Wikimedia Commons</i>)</p><p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>The surprise settlement of Waymo&apos;s trade-secrets lawsuit against Uber last week may have saved both companies from the harsh glare of the spotlight, but it probably won&apos;t determine who supplies your first driverless ride.</p><p>Waymo <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">accused</a> Uber of using its trade secrets to develop Lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars and sought as much as $1.8 billion in damages. But last Friday, the companies announced a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">settlement</a> in which Waymo will get a small stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, and a commitment from the ride-hailing giant not to use Waymo&apos;s confidential hardware or software. </p><p>The settlement, which the companies reached late on February 8 after only four days in court, ended a trial that was expected to last three weeks. A federal jury and a media throng had already heard unsettling tales of take-no-prisoners culture that Uber is trying to put behind it. Waymo ran the risk, like any litigant, of losing its case. </p><p>The deal may allow the companies to take another shot at a partnership they had discussed several times since 2013: Waymo -- then known as Google&apos;s Project Chauffeur -- had driverless cars, and Uber had a popular ride-hailing service. When the planned partnership never actually took shape, Uber started developing its own autonomous technology and the two companies ended up on a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">collision course</a>.</p><p>But this wasn&apos;t a clash between full-fledged rivals in a mature business, like the years-long smartphone litigation between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co." target="new">Apple and Samsung</a>. So far, the self-driving car industry is essentially a set of experiments. That&apos;s why all eyes are on the basic technologies -- for now. </p><p>"Early on, it&apos;s going to be about technology leadership. But later on, it&apos;s going to be about business models and supply chains," said Bob O&apos;Donnell, president of market research and consulting firm Technalysis Research. </p><p>If Uber was using stolen Waymo designs -- which Uber denies -- the settlement may cost the company some time in its quest to make cars drive themselves, which ultimately affects its bottom line and market value, O&apos;Donnell said. "The entire business model of Uber is based on the fact that eventually they aren&apos;t going to have to pay anybody." </p><p>But by 2030, when various forecasts predict autonomous cars will perform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/25-of-u-s-driving-could-be-done-by-self-driving-cars-by-2030-study-finds/" target="new">many</a> of our trips -- as much as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/rethinkx-selfdriving-electric-cars-will-dominate-roads-by-2030" target="new">95%</a> of all miles driven -- last week&apos;s settlement may be a nothing more than a footnote. </p><p>"It&apos;s important now, but in 12 years, the market dynamics will also have changed a lot," O&apos;Donnell said. The sky&apos;s the limit on what could happen by then. Uber might have acquired Waymo, or vice versa. And everyone in today&apos;s car business, including both automakers and component suppliers like Bosch and Continental, is looking for a piece of the business. </p><p>"There&apos;s not going to be one winner. Even if Waymo has a head start now, that&apos;s not the end of the story," O&apos;Donnell said. </p><p>What&apos;s more, all the winners will need partners to succeed. The whole car industry is a complex web of manufacturers and suppliers. Even Tesla relies on third parties for some of its technology. </p><p>There&apos;s a good chance Waymo will eventually be a technology supplier to Uber, Lyft -- where it&apos;s already invested $1 billion -- and other mobility providers, O&apos;Donnell said. Just because Waymo will soon be able to <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">pick you up</a> in a driverless SUV in a few cities doesn&apos;t mean it wants to break into the ride-hailing business for good. </p><p>What may seem like an epic battle for the streets in a San Francisco courtroom is really a fringe fight to most consumers, O&apos;Donnell said. "There&apos;s the Silicon Valley view of the world, and then there&apos;s the actual world."</p><p>A Technalysis survey of 1,000 US consumers last year found that 57% had never used a ride-hailing service and another 23% had only done it once or twice. So what was imminently at stake here wasn&apos;t personal transportation in the suburbs and midsized cities of America. It was reputation, the most valuable commodity in Silicon Valley -- after coding skills and a killer funding round.</p> <p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

The Interagency AV Working Group is made up of representatives from other city agencies that focus on transportation, disability rights, environmental issues and public safety.</p><p>The agency&apos;s first task is to create a proposal to test autonomous and self-driving vehicles on 10th Street, SW, near the L&apos;Enfant Plaza.</p><p>"We will keep the District on the cutting edge of autonomous vehicles and do so in a way that benefits our residents," said Mayor Bowser in a <a href="https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-establishes-autonomous-vehicle-working-group" target="new">statement</a>. "Washington, DC is a creative, tech-savvy city, and as we grow, we will always be exploring and investing in innovation and finding ways to make it more inclusive."</p><p>The new agency is also working with the city&apos;s Southwest Business Improvement District, which works to improve and maintain about 483 acres within the southwest part of Washington, <a href="https://www.swbid.org/" target="new">according to its website</a>.</p><p>If the city&apos;s proposal is accepted, the autonomous vehicle program would run along 10th Street, which connects the National Mall via Independence Avenue and Banneker Park to The Wharf, according to the mayor&apos;s office. The street sits above Interstate 395 and about 4,300 cars travel it each day, which would be enough to test autonomous vehicles in real-life traffic situations.</p><p>The first step in this process is a Request for Information (RFI), which asks for information and input from autonomous vehicle providers and other technology companies. <a href="https://www.swbid.org/avrfi" target="new">The RFI also offers a look</a> at where proposed testing route is located. <p>Washington&apos;s elected officials began exploring autonomous vehicle technology in 2017, and Bowser recently traveled to Silicon Valley to pitch the city as a test area for the technology. If approved, it would make the District one of the few Northeast cities testing autonomous technology.</p><p>Right now, most self-driving and autonomous vehicle testing is conducted in the Western US, in Nevada, Arizona and <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">California</a>, which is near where these technologies are being developed in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>A consumer group wants the US Senate to scrap a bill that would streamline regulation for self-driving cars.</p><p>In a <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/sites/default/files/2018-02/LtrSenate020918.pdf" target="new">letter</a> sent to senators on February 12, Consumer Watchdog cited so-called disengagement reports by companies testing autonomous cars in California. Those reports showed how often safety drivers had to take over the cars because their self-driving systems failed or didn&apos;t respond correctly to what was going on around them. </p> <p>Congress shouldn&apos;t allow self-driving cars on the road if they can&apos;t actually drive themselves yet, the group said. </p><p>"As it stands, this piece of legislation gives self-driving car manufacturers full authority in deciding whether or not the vehicles they manufacture are prepared to roam the streets without human supervision," the letter said. </p><p>Sen. John Thune of South Dakota proposed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/srpt187/CRPT-115srpt187.pdf" target="new">AV START Act</a> in November. For now, the bill is stalled because three Senate Democrats, including California&apos;s Dianne Feinstein, have placed holds on it. Safety provisions are key concerns for them. </p> <p>The bill would update federal vehicle rules for vehicle safety in order to help get self-driving cars on the road. After three years, it would allow the US Department of Transportation to give exemptions for up to 80,000 autonomous vehicles per manufacturer. The bill would require manufacturers to submit safety reports, but based on a voluntary safety assessment proposed by the Department of Transportation. </p> <p>The act is also intended to keep autonomous car regulation from becoming a mishmash of different state laws while the DoT formulates new federal rules. </p><p>Consumer Watchdog says the AV START Act wouldn&apos;t create meaningful regulation or a way to verify that self-driving cars actually work. </p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">2017 reports</a> from California, which allow autonomous vehicle testing but require companies to report things like accidents and test-driver interventions, showed all companies that tested cars ran into cases where safety drivers had to take over. Twenty companies filed reports. </p><p>Waymo&apos;s cars <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/42aff875-7ab1-4115-a72a-97f6f24b23cc/Waymofull.pdf" target="new">went furthest</a> without human intervention, going an average of 5,596 miles before a driver had to take over. The automotive arm of Google parent Alphabet reported 63 incidents in 352,545 miles. In testing by most other companies, the cars went only a few hundred miles between incidents. </p> <p>Drivers had to take over because the cars executed unwanted maneuvers, incorrectly predicted what other drivers and pedestrians would do, didn&apos;t perceive their surroundings correctly, or lost their GPS signals, among other things. In some cases, the self-driving cars appeared headed for a collision when the driver intervened. </p> <p>California hasn&apos;t yet allowed cars to hit public streets without a safety driver, though it has drafted rules that might allow it. But in Arizona, where regulation is more lax, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Waymo</a> has tested truly driverless cars on public roads and plans to launch a driverless ride-hailing service this year. </p><p>Cities, states and the federal government are all looking to regulate aspects of autonomous vehicles. On Tuesday, Washington, DC, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">launched an effort</a> to get self-driving tests going in some parts of the district. Indiana lawmakers are currently <a href="http://wbaa.org/post/industry-groups-divided-self-driving-car-regulations-bill" target="new">considering</a> a state law that would supersede tighter local restrictions. But the DoT and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) traditionally have taken the lead in regulating vehicles in the US. </p> <p>Congress is trying to catch up with the growth of autonomous cars. Last September, the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving/u-s-house-unanimously-approves-sweeping-self-driving-car-measure-idUSKCN1BH2B2" target="new">passed</a> a bill similar to the AV START Act that would let manufacturers deploy as many as 25,000 cars without meeting current safety standards in the first year, rising to 100,000 after three years.</p><p>The Trump administration has indicated the president supports the bills. </p><p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

But excluding legal expenses and some other costs, such as stock-based compensation and taxes, the loss was only $2.2 billion. </p> <p>A week ago, Uber was facing a $1.8 billion trade-secrets lawsuit by Waymo in a case that set a record for packing lawyers into Judge William Alsup&apos;s federal courtroom in San Francisco. Each side had nine attorneys on hand for the <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">opening arguments</a>.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">settlement</a> reached last Thursday ended what was expected to be a three-week trial, as Uber gave Alphabet&apos;s autonomous car business a $245 million equity stake and a commitment not to use the company&apos;s trade secrets. Waymo had accused Uber of using eight stolen hardware secrets in a frantic bid to catch up in driverless cars. </p><p>Self-driving cars are cool, but they&apos;re also a key part of Uber&apos;s financial future, holding out the prospect of running its ride-hailing business without drivers. That would eliminate both a huge portion of Uber&apos;s costs and a part of its business that has led to controversy and legal battles. </p><p>"This war for self-driving is truly existential for Uber: we&apos;ll either start up our second S curve of growth or we&apos;ll die," Uber Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden wrote in an email to then-CEO Travis Kalanick in 2016 that was presented as evidence in the trial. </p><p>The ultimate business model of the money-losing company, founded in 2009 and now worth an estimated $68 billion, may depend on driverless cars. Uber is taking in more money than ever. In last year&apos;s fourth quarter, its net revenue was $2.22 billion, up 61% from a year earlier, Bloomberg reported. Sales for the whole year reached $7.5 billion, up from about $6.5 billion in 2016. </p><p>The company&apos;s losses may be narrowing. For 2016, it reported an adjusted net loss of $2.8 billion, excluding results from its China business, which was sold off in July of that year. Still, the company ended 2017 with less cash than it started with: $6 billion, down 13% from the end of 2016. </p><p>Things may be looking up for Uber, which went through a dramatic and public meltdown last year over its internal culture and alleged spying practices.</p><p>In June, Kalanick resigned as CEO under pressure, though he remained on the company&apos;s sometimes contentious board. Dara Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia executive, took over as CEO in August. In late December, Uber sold a 15% stake to Japan&apos;s SoftBank Group, reportedly at a discount to its $68 billion valuation.

Uber will keep investing in Asia, and driverless cars are the only way to eventually make rides cost $1 per mile, he said.

Automakers and regulators are weighing the two alternatives for V2X, which is expected to improve safety and traffic flow. </p><p>VW will provide WLANp as standard equipment at no extra cost on all its personal and commercial vehicles. It says the move will help create a broad network of information on traffic risks and promote accident-free driving. Volkswagen Group is one of the largest automakers in the world, with <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/volkswagen-group-achieves-record-sales-in-2017/a-42177892" target="new">2017 sales</a> of 10.7 million vehicles.</p><p>V2X can help cars "see" each other even where buildings or other vehicles block the view, including around corners and in highway passing situations. It has a range of hundreds of meters and can reach farther than the radar and Lidar systems being built into driverless cars. </p> <p>If one car is about to run a red light and another is nearing the intersection at a blind corner, V2X in both cars could generate an alert -- or make either car stop, depending on how much automation was built into the cars. It could also send a signal from one car to the vehicles behind it when the brakes are applied so they can automatically slow down or generate a driver alert. </p><p>V2X links could also help vehicles see pedestrians with mobile devices and communicate with infrastructure like traffic lights and warning signs. Wirelessly linked trucks could form convoys that roam the highways together to run more efficiently.</p><p>(Think speed control to maintain a safe distance, not drivers conspiring over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy_(song)" target="new">CB radio</a>.) </p><p>But while regulators and industry generally agree on the potential for V2X, there&apos;s less harmony over what system to use. </p><p>WLANp is based on IEEE 802.11p, part of the standard behind WiFi. Its proponents say the technology is tested and ready to go. Regulators in both the US and Europe have used it in developing standards for future cars and infrastructure and have set aside similar frequencies for the radios to use. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has proposed requiring an 802.11p-based system called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) in all US vehicles. All these steps could help clear the way for wireless LANs to show up in all new vehicles and infrastructure. </p><p>But recently, some major automotive tech suppliers have started to say cellular, or C-V2X, may be the best, fastest, and most secure way to go.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Uber has brought its publicly available tool for viewing and analyzing Uber trip information to its hometown of San Francisco.</p><p>The tool, called <a href="https://movement.uber.com/cities" target="new">Uber Movement</a>, provides large sets of data about the trips that Uber cars make, along with tools for crunching that data. Anyone with an Uber account can use it. It&apos;s designed to help city officials and the public study traffic trends and predict how events or changes might affect mobility around the region. </p> <p>Uber released Movement for the San Francisco Bay Area on January 30, about a year after it was introduced. The tool is already available for at least three other cities -- Boston, Cincinnati and Washington, DC -- and the company has said it plans eventually to make it available for all cities where Uber operates. </p> <p>Uber has been at odds with many cities since it started disrupting taxi services and transit in 2009. But the very popularity that makes Uber look like a threat to some city agencies also gives it great visibility into the day-to-day transportation experience. As a single entity providing a large percentage of the trips made in cities, Uber can uncover a lot of information about how well the road network operates. </p><p>Uber says Movement provides planners with better, fresher information than they can get from traditional studies, which may be years old and not as comprehensive. Plus, the data and analysis are free and easily available online, a boon to both professionals and ordinary citizens. </p><p>Movement data is anonymized so users can&apos;t see who took each trip, Uber says. Its main function is to show how long trips took between one area and another during a given time period, date range, or day of the week. For example, if a construction project blocked one lane of a street for a week, Movement could show how much that slowed down drivers who traveled through that part of the city. In some cases, trip data could even help to reveal where potholes are.</p> <p>The tool is one step toward making Uber a part of cities&apos; overall transportation systems rather than just a provider of cars for hire. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi described this ambitious goal in a speech to an investment banking conference last week. </p><p>"I want to run the bus systems for a city," Khosrowshahi said, according to <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/14/17014762/uber-softbank-dara-khosrowshahi-goldman-sachs" target="new">Recode</a>. He also envisions Uber trips that combine modes of transportation, such as a subway ride to a station where a car -- or a bike -- is waiting for the rider to travel the last mile to their destination. </p><p>Some municipalities are already integrating ride-hailing services into their transportation plans. Five cities in central Florida now offer <a href="https://www.altamonte.org/736/Uber" target="new">discounted Uber rides</a> as a form of public transit. But in many places, Uber&apos;s relationship with transit is tense and competitive. To some, the multiple-passenger service UberPool looks alarmingly like a replacement for public buses. Some cities are <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/transportation/article194515734.html" target="new">borrowing</a> aspects of the private ride-hailing experience to help their own services compete against companies like Uber. </p><p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

Arizona issued the permit on January 24, according to <a href="https://qz.com/1208897/alphabets-waymo-googl-is-readying-a-ride-hailing-service-in-arizona-that-could-directly-compete-with-uber/" target="new">Quartz</a>.</p><p>Waymo says it plans to launch the service this year and has <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">ordered</a> "thousands" of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans for its fleet. It&apos;s testing the technology in five states and has been offering free rides in a trial program in Phoenix since early last year.</p><p>Last November, Waymo sent minivans out without safety drivers to take over if the vehicle made a mistake. </p> <p>The upcoming service will put the Google juggernaut into the ride-hailing business against Uber and Lyft, and with a game-changing technology advantage that neither rival has developed quite to the point Waymo has reached. Robotic taxis without drivers could slash the cost of rides for consumers and dramatically increase the scale of ride-hailing services -- if local, state and federal laws allow it and there are no collisions that raise safety alarms with the public and regulators.</p><p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">predicted</a> last week that self-driving cars would reduce the cost of the average ride from $2.50 per mile to $1 per mile. </p><p>Fear of Google muscling its way into the industry led Uber to hire some of Google&apos;s top automotive engineers in 2016, making the acquisition that led to Waymo and Uber&apos;s recent court battle that was <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">settled</a> earlier this month. In 2013, the two companies had formed a <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">partnership</a> to combine Google&apos;s cars with Uber&apos;s ride-hailing platform, but that deal died of Google&apos;s neglect, according to Uber founder Travis Kalanick. </p>  <p>Still, the race among the three companies is more complex than a pure rivalry. Google Ventures invested more than $250 million in Uber in 2013, Alphabet put $1 billion into Lyft last year, and Waymo won a $245 million stake in Uber in this month&apos;s settlement. Alphabet may not want to enter the ride-hailing business all over the world, given the massive resources that would take, industry analyst Bob O&apos;Donnell of Technalysis Research said earlier this month. Waymo might end up part of either rival company. </p><p>Meanwhile, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/uber-ceo-hopes-to-have-self-driving-cars-in-service-in-18-months/" target="new">hopes</a> to put autonomous cars into commercial service within 18 months, and Lyft announced a self-driving ride <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16742924/lyft-nutonomy-boston-self-driving-car" target="new">pilot in Boston last year and offered <a href="https://jalopnik.com/my-ride-in-a-self-driving-lyft-showed-how-far-autonomou-1822029612" target="new">demonstration rides</a> with different partner during International CES in Las Vegas last month. </p> <p>If autonomous ride services like these catch on, they may help save the environment. </p> <p>On Tuesday, oil giant BP <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/bp-sees-self-driving-electric-vehicles-squeezing-oil-demand-by-2040.html" target="new">predicted</a> that a combination of electric vehicles, shared mobility services and self-driving cars could reduce the use of oil for cars by 2040 -- or at least keep it from growing.

The most common communication methods are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I).</p><p>V2V communication involves one vehicle being able to inform other vehicles within a given proximity of important decisions it makes, while V2I communications involve sending information to, and accepting information from, traffic infrastructure, such as a traffic signal informing a vehicle of a red light.</p><p>Led by Benedetto Piccoli, associate provost for research at Rutgers University-Camden, the study found a single autonomous vehicle can control the flow of at least 20 human-controlled vehicles around it, with substantial reductions in excessive braking and fuel consumption.</p><p>The research comes as the use of a small number of GPS-equipped vehicles in the traffic stream has increased dramatically, changing how traffic is monitored.</p><p>Though gathering this real-time traffic data previously required predominantly fixed sensing infrastructure, recent advancements in vehicular automation and communication technologies provide new possibilities and opportunities for traffic control.</p><p>For example, when a series of adjacent vehicles on a roadway are connected and automated, it is possible to form dense platoons of vehicles which leave very small gaps, in theory eliminating the stop-and-go waves that form so-called "phantom" traffic jams.</p><p>"AVs can revolutionize the control of traffic flow," the report noted. "They offer the potential to shift from localized control measures, like ramp metering, and centralized ones, as variable speed limit gantries, to actuators immersed in the traffic stream."</p><p>While the presented ring experiments represent a stretch of single-lane roadway, the theory also extends to multi-lane freeways, on which lane-changing can serve as an additional trigger of stop-and-go waves.</p><p>The findings were presented to policymakers in Washington, DC at an exhibit at the Washington Auto Show, including US Sen. John Thune, chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.</p><p>"Most of the policymakers, car manufacturers, car dealers, and others we talked with were very impressed with the research results and got a positive feeling about autonomous vehicles," Piccoli <a href="https://news.camden.rutgers.edu/2018/02/study-shows-autonomous-vehicles-can-help-improve-traffic-flow/" target="new">told</a> Rutgers-Camden News Now.

Under the proposed law, local governments couldn&apos;t impose their own regulations.</p><p>Utah is the 13th largest state by area, spanning sparsely populated deserts and snowy mountains -- a particular challenge for fledgling robot drivers -- as well as the sprawling Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The bill&apos;s chief sponsor, Rep. Robert Spendlove, a Republican from Sandy, says it could help the state&apos;s growing technology sector to take the lead in self-driving cars, according to the <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/02/22/utah-soon-could-be-first-state-to-fully-legalize-self-driving-cars-on-its-roads/" target="new">Salt Lake Tribune</a>.</p><p>Supporters say allowing self-driving cars will help to make roads safer because robot cars don&apos;t run red lights, drive drunk or text while driving. (Surveys suggest consumers <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">haven&apos;t quite bought</a> the safety argument yet.) </p><p>Spendlove&apos;s bill would set up a standard way for owners to register and insure autonomous cars. It would also make sure crashes are handled the same way when there&apos;s no driver behind the wheel: The self-driving car would have to remain at the scene, just like a human driver does, and the car&apos;s owner would have to report the crash. </p><p>The bill will define different rules for each level of autonomous technology, from Level 1 systems like adaptive cruise control to future Level 5 vehicles that won&apos;t need a driver, pedals or a steering wheel. </p><p>Though it mostly amends existing laws, it&apos;s an ambitious measure on a technology that&apos;s still evolving and controversial. Spendlove has said he may put off the bill&apos;s effective date until the middle of next year to allow for more work on it. </p><p>The promise of tech investment and the prospect of driverless vehicles hitting the road in the next few years are leading many states to craft laws and programs to deal with these cars. This month, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Massachusetts and Indiana</a> have debated autonomous vehicle regulation and the District of Columbia has created an agency to prepare for testing and other developments. Legislatures in five states have passed laws on autonomous vehicles, and 30 others have considered legislation, according to the <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Automated_Driving:_Legislative_and_Regulatory_Action" target="new">Center for Internet and Society</a>.</p> <p>Some proponents of the technology say the growing patchwork of laws could hamper the industry, and the federal government is trying to step in with <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">national regulations</a>. But states that step forward may stand to gain. </p> <p>Arizona, which is home to some chipmaking operations but not one of the country&apos;s biggest tech or car hubs, has become a hotbed of self-driving activity since its governor gave an executive order on autonomous vehicles in 2015.

The cars we drive are changing, and so are the ways we commute.</p><p>The initial excitement is often overshadowed by uncertainty and reluctance to try something new. The focus on user experience (UX) is driving a profound shift in how connected cars are envisioned. In fact, UX is fast becoming the defining strategy of every company shifting toward the connected car market share. Forward-thinking UX holds up a mirror to the future that is a perfect "third place."</p><b>Evolving the continuum – digital lifestyles & cars</b><br/>Mechanical excellence is no longer the battleground for automakers. To create meaningful innovations and capture consumers&apos; interest in digital lifestyle, automakers must strive to understand users and care about their lives.</p> <p>It is all about building less of a machine and more of a car as a companion.</p> <p>This evolution will require a collaboration between those who understand and advocate for the user and those who strategize and integrate the technology. Together, they will create cars of the future.</p><b>Putting data in the driver&apos;s seat</b><br/>Cars are increasingly becoming data powerhouses as they become ever more connected and empowered by smart, IoT technology.</p> <p>The richness of insights is unlocking a digital gold rush around the connected car, transforming vehicles to be as unique as the people in them.

Software-based platforms, of which AI-based technologies are a part, tend to make every aspect of the connected car more essential and also more valuable.</p><p>There are two key imperatives to get ahead of this inevitable disruption.</p><p>The first is user-centered design, or UCD.</p> <p>UCD is an amalgamation of design and science with the goal of making products and services user-desirable, business-viable and technologically feasible. Factor in behaviors, preferences, context, goals and aspirations while defining the connected car strategy.</p> <p>Ask questions, build uses cases, personalize the experience. What is their "Job-To-be-Done?" What are their priorities? Are they doing five other things at the same time? How can the car help improve their lifestyle?</P><p>The second is collaboration and co-creation.</p><p>Whether it is be it incremental or breakthrough innovation, the concept of siloed genius dies hard.</p><p>Although it is imperative for automakers to leverage their independent expertise and clout, isolated actions lead to a fragmented experience.</p><p>Too many existing companies have evolved into silos of expertise. To succeed, leveraging partnerships and participating in ecosystems becomes crucial for automotive manufacturers, suppliers and service providers.</P><p>The next few years will be an incredibly creative period.

The list includes well-known names such as BMW, LG Electronics, Continental, Sierra Wireless and ZTE. </p> <p><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/technologies/lte/advanced-pro/cellular-v2x" target="new">C-V2X</a>, or cellular vehicle-to-anything, is a way to use cellular radios in cars to communicate with other vehicles, pedestrians&apos; phones, and roadway infrastructure such as traffic signals and warning signs. One use of C-V2X would be to notify cars approaching a blind intersection that there&apos;s a speeding vehicle around the corner that&apos;s about to run a red light. </p><p>It&apos;s important for many different suppliers to join in on a technology like C-V2X, because it can&apos;t deliver benefits like safety unless a lot of things use the same system. Vendors from different industries all need to sign on. </p><p>C-V2X uses 5G technology and is designed as one element of a complex set of sensors and networks, including Lidar and radar, that may someday keep self-driving cars informed about everything around them. Before that, C-V2X might help to keep manually driven vehicles from crashing into each other. </p> <p>Automotive wireless networks such as C-V2X are starting to overcome the limits of human vision and robotic line of sight. With wireless signaling, cars can virtually see each other even where drivers can&apos;t and respond appropriately. In the example of the red-light runner at a blind corner, vehicles approaching the intersection could automatically brake or warn drivers to brake. If the traffic light had the right wireless radio, it might send a warning to the oncoming car or even stop it from running the red. </p><p>C-V2X isn&apos;t the only way to make all this work. There&apos;s also a wireless LAN standard related to WiFi that&apos;s used in technologies such as WLANp and Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC). Volkswagen Group <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">announced</a> earlier this month that it would equip all its European cars with WLANp beginning next year. The US government has been pushing DSRC for several years. Qualcomm also has products in this category. </p><p>But Qualcomm says it has a global ecosystem of automakers, component suppliers, software companies and system integrators committed to C-V2X and the 9150 chipset. They include participants in China, South Korea, Japan, Germany, France and the US. </p> <p>One of the selling points for C-V2X is that it could build on the 5G mobile ecosystem and take advantage of carriers&apos; cellular networks. In addition to direct wireless links among cars and nearby infrastructure like signs, C-V2X can connect cars to the larger cellular network. Those vehicle-to-network links could be used for services like traffic and hazard warnings, locations of parking spots, and streaming information and entertainment. </p><p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

wp post create --post_author='Stephen Lawson' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='<p>Connected cars give consumers more ways to spend money while driving. SAP has now made some deals that will help grease the wheels for those transactions.</p> <p>Three major companies have signed on to use the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/connected-car-apps-network.html" target="new">SAP Vehicles Network</a>, a B2B marketplace that brings together providers of services with channels for selling them in cars. SAP announced the new customers today at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. </p><p>MasterCard will provide an in-car payment mechanism, Here will supply navigation capabilities, and Postmates will make its on-demand delivery service available to other businesses through the marketplace. In addition, SAP has integrated its own Concur Expense product with the Vehicles Network, through the Concur App Center, so mobile workers can more easily report trip details. </p> <p>SAP launched the network in 2015 to help realize the commercial potential of in-vehicle Internet connections. Since then, more models have become connected and automakers and others have worked to make more services available in cars. For example, Ford offers tools to shop for parking and gas in its <a href="https://www.fordpass.com/en_us/app.html" target="new">FordPass app</a>. SAP Vehicles Network has about 50 customers now, but the deals SAP announced on Tuesday might do a lot to propel it forward. </p><p>The idea behind the SAP Vehicles Network is that many types of businesses, including gas stations, parking lots and restaurants, want to reach consumers while they&apos;re driving. Connected cars make that possible, but not every provider of a service can have its own sales channel in the car. They need to work through channels such as automakers, car-rental companies, enterprises and mobile app providers to get in front of drivers. The network also includes suppliers of components for automotive services, such as navigation and payment systems. </p> <p>The heart of SAP Vehicles Network is a common API that lets all those players meet in the cloud. SAP supplies the API and collects a per-transaction fee when it&apos;s used. </p><p>The API is agnostic to mobile platforms and car brands. It can be used for many applications, but for now it&apos;s available in versions for parking, fuel and food, Gil Perez, SAP&apos;s senior vice president of IoT and Digital Supply Chain, told Connected Car. They are designed to make those types of transactions easier, Perez said in an interview. </p> <p>For example, a driver who&apos;s running late can find available parking spaces near a destination, reserve one of those spaces ahead of time, and pay for the space without taking out cash or a credit card, he said. The location of the chosen parking space can be sent to the car&apos;s navigation system, and the gate to the lot can be automatically opened. </p><p>The API includes code for each of those steps. With the Vehicles Network, SAP wants to help parking companies offer spaces across the US on a single service by using the common API. </p> <p>Now that Here has joined the network, parking services providers will have a way to integrate Here&apos;s navigation platform into their software to help drivers find spaces, Perez said. Payments will play into even more types of in-car services. MasterCard is making its tokenized payment system available for secure transactions on the SAP Vehicles Network. The system replaces a consumer&apos;s personal account number with a secure token, or alternative number, to keep transactions safe. </p> <p>With it, consumers can buy gas or make other purchases from inside the car without having to hand over their credit cards, SAP says. Features for customer loyalty programs and analytics will also be available for those transactions. </p><p>Postmates integration will give merchants a way to reach drivers who want to order ahead and pick something up at home or the office. </p> <p>SAP&apos;s Concur Expense can use information from other components and services that use the Vehicles Network API, Perez said. For example, employees can automatically add mileage statistics or gas purchases to an expense report rather than filling out forms. </p><p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

The agency won&apos;t permit driverless trucks or commercial vehicles but said it would study the safety and regulatory issues around that question. </p> <p>As home to mild climates and some of the biggest autonomous car firms, California is the leading state for testing, with 50 companies approved to run trials. The state has issued permits to test self-driving vehicles with backup drivers since 2014. </p><p>Driverless cars might go commercial first in Arizona, where Alphabet&apos;s Waymo subsidiary plans to launch a robot taxi service this year around Phoenix and recently <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">won</a> a car-for-hire license. But Waymo, Uber and GM&apos;s Cruise division, all based in the San Francisco Bay Area, are all pushing hard to get vehicles on the road without drivers. In statements sent to The Connected Car, all three welcomed the announcement but didn&apos;t say when they would deploy driverless cars in the state. </p><p>Americans are still <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">wary</a> of self-driving cars, and the long list of conditions that comes along with the new permission reflects some of their concerns. </p><p>For one thing, any company providing a driverless car for public use will need to certify it meets "current industry standards" for protection against cyber attacks intended take control of the car or disable it, though those standards are still <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2017/12/18/to-handle-driverless-cars-cybersecurity-regulation-needs-a-software-update/" target="new">a work in progress</a>. In addition, a remote operator will have to be able to connect to the car. </p> <p>Companies that want to test cars without drivers will need to notify local authorities in writing. The state will also keep requiring annual <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">disengagement reports</a>, where companies doing tests disclose when and why autonomous systems failed or had to be overridden.</p><p>The fact that supposedly self-driving cars have had software failures and can&apos;t always deal with unexpected situations during testing has <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">raised some alarms</a>.</p> <p>Companies will still be able to get permits to test self-driving cars with backup drivers onboard. </p><p>Fully driverless cars also raise other new questions, some of which the DMV has tried to address with its regulations. The cars will need a way to communicate with law enforcement when there&apos;s no one in the car for an officer to talk to. They&apos;ll also need to be able to transmit information about their owner or operator in the event of a crash. </p><p>States are scrambling to set rules for self-driving cars, in part so they can participate in what is seen as a potentially huge industry that&apos;s just getting off the ground. This month, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Massachusetts</a>, Indiana, <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">Utah</a> and Washington, D.C., have taken or debated steps to regulate the technology. </p><p>Critics worry a crazy quilt of regulations will stunt the growth of a national industry. Congress is now considering legislation to set standards for self-driving and driverless vehicles.

Their suit, filed on Tuesday, February 27, in Alameda County Superior Court, doesn&apos;t ask for monetary damages but asks the court to force Uber to give disabled people equal access.</p><p>In a statement by email, Uber said it&apos;s always working to expand access.</p> <p>"We take this issue seriously, and are continuously exploring ways to facilitate mobility and freedom via the Uber App for all riders, including riders who use motorized wheelchairs," according to Uber&apos;s statement.</p><p>On-demand ride services such as Uber could be a boon to people who have difficulty taking buses and trains and getting to and from transit stops. With so many individual cars operating around the clock, they may allow for more spontaneous trips than travelers could take with traditional paratransit or dial-a-ride services.</p> <p>Some cities, such as Santa Monica, Calif., have <a href="http://smdp.com/dial-a-ride-to-see-major-overhaul-next-year/163532" target="new">contracted</a> with private ride-hail companies to replace overburdened or inconvenient city services.

wp post create --post_author='' --post_date='' --post_date_gmt='' --post_content='A new study by the University of Michigan shows that the components and computer power to operate connected and fully autonomous vehicles could eliminate their benefits, specifically by creating more pollution than conventional cars.</p><p>Only when the world switches to 100% renewable energy will the environmental benefits of electric and connected cars be achieved,<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b04576" target="new">according to researchers</a>.</p><p>The paper, published by researchers at the University of Michigan and the Ford Motor Innovation Center in February, shows that autonomous cars could have a substantial energy toll, effectively making them more polluting than current manually driven vehicles.</p><p>For their results the researchers used the 2015 US average mix for electricity generation: 34% coal, 32% natural gas, 20% nuclear, 6% hydro, 5% wind, and 3% other renewables including solar. The team tested several vehicles, including the Tesla Model S, the Ford Fusion and Waymo&apos;s Chrysler Pacifica. <p>The technology installed in connected vehicles and the infrastructure -- such as Vehicle-to-Everything technologies -- require a significant amount of power to operate. The results indicate that connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) subsystems could increase vehicle energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 3% to 20% due to electronics power consumption, weight, drag, and data transmission.</p><p>The study identifies four factors in using connected and autonomous vehicles that contribute to more energy use:</P><ul><li>CAV components increase energy consumption. In the Tesla Model S, the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/drive-px/" target="new">Nvidia Drive PX2</a> uses 96W of power, and the <a href="http://velodynelidar.com/hdl-64e.html" target="new">Velodine HDL-64E Lidar</a> another 60W. Total power usage of the AV electronics exceeds 200W.</li><li>The components increase the weight of the vehicle -- adding four to ten kilograms (kgs) depending on configuration -- pushing up its fuel or power use. In the case of combustion-engine connected vehicles that could add from 0.073 to 0.27 liters per 100 kilometers.</li><li>Exterior-mounted components increase the aerodynamic drag. A small roof rack mounted on a passenger car can increase fuel consumption by 0.5%. A large roof rack, such as the Velodine, can impact fuel economy by as much as 15%.</li><li>Data transmission can have an impact on the power use of the cellular networks. The researchers estimate that connected vehicles will use about 1.4MB/mile driven, based on data usage from map applications. A conservative estimate is that a light vehicle will use about 200GB over its lifetime. That will correspond to 275 Megajoules of power including the consumption of the basestation, telecom network, and data centers.</li></ul><p>"GHG emissions increase by 2.8−4.0% after the addition of a small or medium CAV subsystem to a platform vehicle. This modest increase rises to a significant impact of approximately 20% with a large subsystem," according to the report.</p><p>An additional concern is the potential increase of car use because of convenience. Autonomous cars could encourage people to engage in longer commutes, as they won&apos;t need to drive or park the cars, making public transport even less appealing than it is now.</p><p>"The arrival of autonomous cars will increase the Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), reverse the millennial trend eschewing driving, [and] decimate public transport," said former NYC Traffic Commissioner Samuel Schwartz -- a.k.a. Gridlock Sam -- during a conference in Barcelona in 2017.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/evMKn20T2Uo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>"There could be a rebound effect. They could induce travel, adding to congestion and fuel use," Greg Keoleian, the senior author, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/exposing-the-power-vampires-in-self-driving-cars" target="new">wrote in the study</a>.</p><p>While there are considerable advances in technology that could reduce the power consumption over the next few years, such as 5G networks and optimized components, vehicles manufactured today will be operating for many years, and their electronics will continue to draw power the same way.</p><p>"We knew there was going to be a tradeoff in terms of the energy and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the equipment and the benefits gained from operational efficiency. I was surprised that it was so significant," Keoleian wrote.</p><p>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/67216.pdf" target="new">reported in November 2016</a> that "projected energy use reaching as low as less than 40% and as high as three times the current level of U.S. [light-duty vehicle] LDV fuel consumption," when factoring CAV technology adoption.</p> <p>"CAVs are a disruptive technology that will likely transform personal mobility and the built urban landscape in the coming decades ... Some effects such as shared mobility and optimized routing will decrease energy use and emissions, while other effects such as increased mobility demand will increase energy use and emissions," the Michigan study concludes.</p><p><i>-- Pablo Valerio is a technology writer and consultant working out of his home city of Barcelona, Catalonia.

Here are five things you won&apos;t learn from Waymo&apos;s video.</p><b>1. Some places aren&apos;t so easy to navigate</b><br/>Waymo shows a driverless car in a developed suburban area on a sunny day. It uses animation to show how the car senses everything around it, such as lanes, signals and crosswalks. It uses a combination of Lidar to build a detailed view of the surroundings, radar to detect objects and their speed, and cameras to capture things like the colors of traffic lights.</p><p>That&apos;s probably an accurate depiction of how Waymo&apos;s cars navigate the Phoenix area, where the ride service is set to launch this year.</p> <p>But Waymo is launching in Phoenix for a reason, and it&apos;s not just that the state of Arizona allowed it. It&apos;s a modern city with relatively wide, well-marked streets and mostly clear weather. Less developed areas, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/gms-cruise-explains-why-self-driving-tests-in-dense-cities-gives-it-an-edge/" target="new">jam-packed cities</a> and regions with <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20160210/OEM06/160219995/self-driving-cars-succumb-to-snow-blindness-as-driving-lanes-disappear" target="new">tougher weather</a> are harder for self-driving cars to master.</p> <p>Engineers everywhere are working to solve those problems, and Waymo&apos;s minivans may even be ready to take them on. But what its video shows is more of a best-case scenario.</p><b>2. Self-driving cars still need help sometimes</b><br/>For all the talk of cars going driverless, we&apos;re not quite at the stage where autonomous Chevrolet Bolts and Chrysler Pacificas are going to head off on romantic weekends together.</p><p>"Disengagement reports" required from all companies testing in California show that last year, each faced situations where human operators had to take over. The reasons included software failures, impending crashes and unexpected actions by pedestrians or other drivers. Waymo <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">led the pack</a> in 2017 with just 63 disengagements in 352,545 test miles, but that was still an average of one every 5,596 miles. Most other companies had to take over their cars every few hundred miles. Even when it starts allowing cars with no one in the driver&apos;s seat next month, California will make companies prove humans can take over their cars remotely.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B8R148hFxPw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>That doesn&apos;t mean users of Waymo&apos;s service will get stranded while their cars figure out what to do. But think of this generation of vehicles as teenagers who just got their licenses.</p><b>3. It&apos;s more than learning from &apos;experience&apos;</b><br/><p>"What makes everything you can see right now possible is experience. Waymo has already self-driven millions of miles on complicated city streets, and it&apos;s constantly learning from every single mile it drives," the narrator claims.</p><p>Collecting fine-grained data about every trip, plus additional miles traversed in simulations, does help autonomous driving platforms interpret what they see and predict how others will behave. But making multiple driving decisions per second also takes advanced <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/advanced-cars/deep-learning-makes-driverless-cars-better-at-spotting-pedestrians" target="new">algorithms</a> -- or even <a href="https://qz.com/1204395/self-driving-cars-trolley-problem-philosophers-are-building-ethical-algorithms-to-solve-the-problem/" target="new">philosophy</a> translated into code.</p><p>That may give an edge to companies like Waymo, which grew out of Google and is part of its parent company, Alphabet. Software is invisible, but it matters as much as the gear around the car.</p><b>4. An autonomous car is a mobile device</b><br/>Waymo&apos;s video shows a cool, smart vehicle that knows how to get around by itself.</p><p>But self-driving cars are part of complex systems that include onboard technology, cloud-based services and -- eventually -- roadway infrastructure. How much intelligence will reside in the car and how much in the cloud is still up for debate. Wireless networks, eventually using 5G, will play important roles -- and might raise <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-5g-will-drive-the-adoption-of-self-driving-cars-2017-12" target="new">coverage issues</a>.</p><p>Google, Intel, China&apos;s Baidu and other companies are building <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-hy-self-driving-maps-20180221-story.html" target="new">navigation platforms</a> that use constant sensor data from cars to maintain a comprehensive map in the cloud. Wireless networks for cars and nearby infrastructure, such as <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">C-V2X</a> and <a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp" target="new">WLANp</a>, could provide traffic warnings and eventually trigger automatic braking. </p><b>5. Your automated ride may someday be &apos;free&apos;</b><br/> This one is just speculation so far, but driverless cars may even change the way we pay for rides.</p><p>Here&apos;s how that might happen: Eliminating the driver is expected to slash the cost of getting driven across town. (Uber predicts average cost per mile will fall from $2.50 to $1.) At that price, local businesses might decide it&apos;s worth giving away rides just to get people in the door.</p><p>The store or restaurant might be <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/01/technology/future/free-transportation-self-driving-cars/index.html" target="new">the destination itself</a> or just <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/self-driving-cars-free-future/548945/" target="new">a mandatory stop</a> along the way where there&apos;s a good chance riders will spend some money.</p> <p>Even if it never actually pays for the rides, marketing will probably help to make the rides pay off. Ride-hailing companies already know where you are, where you&apos;re going, and what spots you often visit. It&apos;s a perfect captive audience for advertisers -- if they can get you to stop staring at a car driving itself.</p><p>-- <i>Stephen Lawson is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

Crozz SUV would make their debut in 2020.</p><p>The I.D. Buzz large capacity passenger vehicle -- essentially the company&apos;s iconic Microbus reconstituted for the 21st century -- will follow those models in 2022.</p><p>Meanwhile, Volkswagen took the wraps off the latest family member of the SEDRIC concept car line in the form of a <a href="http://www.discover-sedric.com/en/" target="new">futuristic school bus</a>, following the original SEDRIC, SEDRIC 42 and SEDRIC Nightlife models.</p><p>Comparisons to school busses of the past end with the conventional yellow paint job -- Volkswagen&apos;s Self-Driving System (SDS) concept has the option of using the OneButton control element to call up the self-driving electric vehicle with one button and collect students door-to-door.</p><p>Designed in a monolithic form with thick body pillars, roomy interior and yellow and black color scheme -- with stylized graffiti accents no less -- the youthful look of the vehicle is aimed at providing an inviting and fun experience, which continues into the interior.</p><p>Inside, aluminum boxes decorated with stickers form the basis for two of the four seats, while the front windscreen is designed as a large-format OLED screen and provides onboard entertainment, and is presumably chewing gum resistant.</p><p>The concept is part of the company&apos;s goal of becoming a global leader in autonomous driving under the Together 2025 plan, a goal long in the making.
