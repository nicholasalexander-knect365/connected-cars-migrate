  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Anything that is linked to a network can theoretically be hacked, and connected cars are no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of a compromised car can be dire. Financial information, personal contacts and GPS data are all information that can be devastating if put in the wrong hands. The stakes figure to be even higher once self-driving cars are on the road in large numbers, as the prospect of someone hijacking and controlling an autonomous vehicle remotely is utterly terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These risks have moved beyond theoretical. In 2015, Fiat Chrysler had to recall over 1.4 million Jeeps -- &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/07/fiat-chrysler-recalls-more-jeeps-wireless-hacking" target="new"&gt;and then 8,000 more&lt;/a&gt; -- after it was discovered that a bug in the vehicle would allow someone to remotely control the car. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/oh-good-new-hack-can-unlock-100-million-volkswagens/" target="new"&gt;Volkswagen came under fire&lt;/a&gt; for a similar situation. A 14-year-old successfully hacked a Delphi Automotives vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2015/02/18/14-year-old-hacker-caught-industry-by-surprise-featured/" target="new"&gt;with $15 worth of parts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's no coincidence, then, that each of those three companies were sponsors of the &lt;a href="https://www.carhackingvillage.com/" target="new"&gt;Car Hacking Village&lt;/a&gt;, an event that was a part of this year's cybersecurity conference &lt;a href="https://www.defcon.org/" target="new"&gt;DEF CON&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside other hyper-relevant topics like voting machine security, it's fitting that the Car Hacking Village was one of the most talked about showcases at DEF CON. Presentations at the Village had titles such as "Insecure by Law," "Grand Theft Radio," and "That's no car. It's a network!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of an event like the Car Hacking Village is a direct result of an increased need for cybersecurity experts in the connected vehicle space. In a matter of years, car manufacturers have gone from being relatively unconcerned with computer technology to relying upon it entirely. As computerized cars become fully connected cars, workers with cybersecurity backgrounds are at a premium for these automakers. In fact, the demand is so great that it is outstripping supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Active outreach in the form of events like the Village has become a key tool in helping companies fill essential cybersecurity positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hacking cars is hard," Casey Ellis, founder of Car Hacking Village sponsor &lt;a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Bugcrowd&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/344539-demand-of-automotive-cyberseuriy-pros-outpaces-supply" target="new"&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;. "It requires specialized equipment and knowledge, not to mention the car. That's part of the reason [manufacturers] jumped into this. It's a good way to access talent they would otherwise be unable to hire."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to move researchers to automobiles," Tod Beardsley told The Hill. Beardsley is director of research of software security company Rapid7, a sponsor of the Village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in-demand skill set is a specific one. The process that cybersecurity experts use to find weaknesses in automotive programs is somewhat counter-intuitive: They try to hack it themselves. By attempting to infiltrate a technology, coders can identify weak points, which is essential knowledge for understanding how to best shore them up. Plus, it gives security specialists insight into the mindset of the hackers they're trying to thwart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to adequately address these issues, the automotive sector needs to undertake a sustained effort to recruit cybersecurity experts over the next several years. Sponsoring events like the Car Hacking Village is a start, but even more will need to be done in the future to grow the talent pool. The future of connected vehicles depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The future of car ownership is changing -- and in more disparate, far-reaching ways than you may realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, there was a panic about millennials and car ownership. As it turns out, those concerns were misplaced, as millennials have come to buy more than their fair share of automobiles in this post-recession era, &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/sc-millennials-autocover-1208-story.html" target="new"&gt;despite record prices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it's their parents, the once-reliable boomers, who are often eschewing vehicle purchases &lt;a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/demographic-shifts-shaping-future-car-ownership/" target="new"&gt;as they flock to urban centers&lt;/a&gt;. Ride-sharing apps such as Uber and Lyft offer taxi-like services to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/23/9603324/uber-coverage-rural-areas-dominance-plan" target="new"&gt; those who live in areas&lt;/a&gt; not widely serviced by taxis, making car ownership less essential even in suburban or rural locales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, as a future of autonomous vehicles approaches, industry observers believe that we'll see ownership trends fundamentally shift. ZipCar UK boss Jonathan Hampson even goes so far as to say that &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734651" target="new"&gt; self-driving cars shouldn't be privately owned&lt;/a&gt; at all in cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual and collective consequences that will come out of these shifts remain to be determined. But one thing is clear: As fluidity and uncertainty become the status quo, automakers, dealerships and service providers need to be open to embracing new trends or risk getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connected car provider &lt;a href="https://services.harman.com/" target="new"&gt;Harman&lt;/a&gt; has an answer in the form of its Car-as-a-Service (CaaS) Solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A play on the Software-as-a-Service (&lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=11&amp;p_id=316"target="new"&gt;SaaS&lt;/a&gt;) model, the &lt;a href="https://services.harman.com/resources/car-as-a-service" target="new"&gt;Harman Ignite platform&lt;/a&gt; allows OEMs, dealers and service providers alike the ability to offer car-sharing and ride-sharing services for a fleet of automobiles, giving them the power of a new revenue stream to accommodate 21st-century driving needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harman's technology gives fleet owners the foundation to offer subscription services and management, as well as advanced remote vehicle monitoring and access. Further, analytics empowers fleet managers to hone their business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harman's CaaS Solution gives automotive companies of all kinds an opportunity to be an early adopter of a business model that figures to grow greatly in prominence in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think we'll head very quickly to a car as a service," engineer and entrepreneur Peter Diamandis &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/peter-diamandis-how-transportation-will-change-in-10-years-2016-8/#the-hyperloop-will-make-transportation-between-cities-easy-and-fast-and-could-be-operating-worldwide-by-2026-1" target="new"&gt;told Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;. "And that changes everything, it changes where you live and work, it changes a lot of things we take for granted right now, like having a parking lot or parking garage goes away."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Harman, the ability to offer such a comprehensive tool comes from the Ignite platform, which turns any equipped vehicle into a full-on connected car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connectivity capabilities allow vehicles to communicate with other Internet of Things technologies, including, critically, other vehicles. Cloud-based driver profiles give drivers the power to maintain a consistent set of settings and preferences across multiple cars. Plus, diagnostics and analytics keep cars with Ignite running safely and efficiently. In June, the Ignite platform won the &lt;a href="http://www.financial-news.co.uk/41917/2017/06/harman-cloud-platform-wins-best-telematics-product-awar/" target="new"&gt;2017 TU-Automotive award&lt;/a&gt; for Best Telematics Product or Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Harman is offering a single cloud platform designed specifically for automotive services and technologies," &lt;a href="http://news.harman.com/releases/harman-ignite-cloud-platform-wins-best-telematics-product-award-and-continues-to-gain-traction-with-automotive-oems" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Roger Lancot, associate director of the global automotive practice of Strategy Analytics, in. a statement. "Harman Ignite offers OEMs a scalable and flexible path to differentiation. This is a major advantage for OEMs as the automotive industry faces major change."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major advantage, indeed: The prospect of adopting a fleet for consumer car services can be a daunting one. But when doing so with a tool like Harman's CaaS platform, dealers, OEMs or service providers will not only be able to make a smooth and efficient transformation -- they'll be making a transformation that protects their businesses for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In July, the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee unanimously approved the Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research in Vehicle Evolution Act. (That's the SELF DRIVE Act for short.) Thanks to its committee approval, the legislation will appear in front of the wider House in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the bill is to get more self-driving cars on the road. It proposes expanding the number of annual exemptions that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issues to allow "unapproved" (i.e. autonomous) vehicles on the road from 2,500 to 100,000. It also seeks to establish councils dedicated to making sure AV technology is used to actively improve the transportation capabilities of the elderly and the disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bipartisan approval of the bill thus far suggests, criticism has been minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in the process, though, some raised concerns that such a massive expansion of self-driving cars on the road could create safety issues. For US Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MICH), however, safety was the one reason she backed the bill. "The development of automated vehicles has the potential to significantly reduce traffic fatalities in the United States," reads &lt;a href="https://debbiedingell.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/dingell-backed-self-driving-car-legislation-advances-house-subcommittee" target="new"&gt;a statement from her office&lt;/a&gt; regarding the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of autonomous vehicles -- and connected cars at large -- prompts questions about another form of safety, too: that of cybersecurity. For years, automakers haven't had to worry about cybersecurity because a lack of Internet connectivity on vehicular computer systems made it a non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the connected car revolution takes place, OEMs are hard at work recruiting cybersecurity experts to make their systems unimpeachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers also want to hold them accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the House considers the legislation approved by the committee, the US Senate has seen a bipartisan group of its members introduce &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-congress-idUSKBN1AH474" target="new"&gt;legislation concerning Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;. Like the House bill that would open the roads to more self-driving cars, the Senate legislation is conspicuously bipartisan: It is sponsored by Mark Warner (D-VA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Steve Daines (R-MT) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Information is a form of currency," &lt;a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?id=06A5E941-FBC3-4A63-B9B4-523E18DADB36" target="new"&gt;Daines wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We need to have proper safeguards in place to ensure that our information is protected while still encouraging innovation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senators behind the bill worked in conjunction with institutions such as the Atlantic Council and Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society to gain expertise and perspective on the type of measures necessary to make IoT technology consistently safe in the US. While the connectivity of IoT tech is its defining and most appealing feature, it is also its greatest weakness. The new bill proposes that vendors make IoT devices patchable, free of unchangeable passwords and known security vulnerabilities. Essentially, it appears to be a codification of best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This legislation would establish thorough, yet flexible, guidelines for Federal Government procurements of connected devices," Warner wrote. "My hope is that this legislation will remedy the obvious market failure that has occurred and encourage device manufacturers to compete on the security of their products."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the autonomous vehicle legislation currently working its way through the House, the Senate's IoT bill looks to tighten existing regulations rather than loosen them. Connected car enthusiasts, however, should be excited about both: Legislators are actively seeking to set up automakers to succeed, something that is both good in and of itself, and a sign of favorable legislative practices to come in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For most companies, the idea of shifting the primary focus of their business -- even within the same general industry -- is an incredibly daunting prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives must leave the sector they know best and quickly become experts in a new field. Then, they must completely overhaul operations and train employees to do new functions entirely. And at the end of it all, there's no guarantee of success -- many companies fold midway through such a transformation. It's such a harrowing idea to some enterprises that they shut down without even attempting a pivot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, some brave companies do succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the case of Delphi Automotive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the company was known for manufacturing car components for electric and electronic architecture, electronics and safety and powertrain systems. In May, though, the company announced that it would be spinning off its powertrain division -- which represented a more traditional sector of the automotive industry --  and focusing the remaining elements of the company on electrical architecture for cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"[Automakers] are requiring a significant ramp up in computing power... and more and faster signals and data distribution in the car," CEO and President &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/05/04/self-driving-car-supplier-delphi-spins-off-division/101258690/" target="new"&gt;Kevin Clark said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. "And we are the only supplier in the industry that has both the electrical architecture that controls computing power, controls signal distribution and the software capability to develop the systems for autonomous driving."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While such a bold move would normally take a long time to yield positive results, the status of the connected car space is so well-regarded that Delphi shares soared over 10% on the day of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the news has only gotten better for Delphi and its shareholders: &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-reports-second-quarter-2017-financial-results" target="new"&gt;Revenue was up 5% during the second quarter of 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Delphi delivered another strong quarter driven by our portfolio of relevant technologies," Clark wrote in a statement. "Based on our strong first half performance, we are raising our sales and earnings outlook for the year. We continue to execute as planned on the announced spin-off of our Powertrain segment and remain committed to providing value to our customers and creating value for our shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, though, no one is surprised to see Delphi surging, considering the series of high-profile partnerships it has established in the connected car sector. (The partnerships also seem to validate Clark's assertion about Delphi's uniqueness; clearly it offers something that many other companies want a part of.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a year, Delphi has been publicly &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/delphis-self-driving-car-is-audi-this-world/" target="new"&gt;collaborating with Audi&lt;/a&gt; on autonomous vehicle systems. In April, &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/story/14099977/1/delphi-automotive-to-supply-over-the-air-update-capability-pioneered-by-tesla.html" target="new"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was providing over-the-air updates for Tesla, a company perceived to be &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2017/07/19/tesla-software-updates-vs-auto-industry/" target="new"&gt;a leader in OTA updates&lt;/a&gt; for automobiles. In May, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/bmw-intel-and-mobileye-bring-delphi-in-on-their-self-driving-platform/" target="new"&gt;BMW and Intel brought Delphi into the fold&lt;/a&gt; for the development of an autonomous driving platform. In June, &lt;a href="http://investor.delphi.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Transdev-and-Delphi-Announce-Commercial-Partnership-for-Autonomous-Transportation/default.aspx" target="new"&gt;Delphi and French company Transdev&lt;/a&gt; launched a partnership to develop a driverless mobility-on-demand transport system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We recognize how complex these systems are, and when you're talking about automated driving where the vehicle is in control, you have to have the most robust, best technology at every link in the chain of that platform," &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-16/delphi-joins-forces-with-bmw-intel-to-build-driverless-platform" target="new"&gt;Delphi CTO Glen De Vos said&lt;/a&gt; following the BMW-Intel announcement. "You're going to see a number of companies that are trying to do everything on their own or in a very closed system are going to really struggle."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, not just any company can make such a major shift in focus and come out unscathed. Delphi's recent success in a new sector is a direct reflection of the strong leadership and operations that made the business successful pre-pivot. But Delphi saw an opportunity to position itself even more favorably for the future, and it was immediately rewarded. Surely other companies will take note.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;While best known for being the primary manufacturer of Apple's iPhones, Foxconn Technology Group makes an awful lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video game enthusiasts almost certainly own at least one Foxconn product, as the company builds the Nintendo 3DS, the Wii U, the PlayStations 3 and 4 and the XBox One. The company also makes cellphones beyond the iPhone, including products for BlackBerry and Nokia, as well as Amazon's Kindle e-reader and Dell PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All told, Foxconn is the world's largest manufacturer of consumer electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as recent news clearly illustrates, &lt;a href="http://www.foxconn.com/" target="newk"&gt;Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; has its sights set on electronics that extend far beyond those that can fit in a user's hands. &lt;a href="http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2105577/foxconn-gives-trumps-jobs-vow-shot-arm-multibillion-dollar" target="new"&gt;The South China Morning Post&lt;/a&gt; reports that the Taiwanese company plans to make a multibillion dollar investment into the development of autonomous vehicle technology in Michigan. The exact amount of the investment remains to be determined. It's also not clear what the money will be used for, but the most likely answer is a research and development facility in some shape or form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Automotive development in the US is still more advanced than China," Foxconn founder Terry Gou told the Post. "Besides self-driving technology, I'm also interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gou's vague allusions to AI and deep learning tech suggests that the media isn't the only one in the dark about Foxconn's intentions in Michigan. The company itself may not have a clear idea of exactly what it plans to do. The announcement of the Michigan initiative came mere days after Foxconn made huge waves elsewhere in the Midwest, with the announcement of a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin to manufacture LCD crystals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That project, however, is already ensconced in controversy after studies showed that the $3 billion in incentives needed to lure Foxconn to Wisconsin &lt;a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/08/wisconsin-taxpayer-payments-foxconn-could-top-300-million-year-2022/546508001/" target="new"&gt;would take at least 25 years for taxpayers to break even on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those economic concerns have given the state legislature some pause in approving the plant and the its requisite incentives, although Gov. Scott Walker maintains that the deal will get done. Between the indeterminate nature of the Michigan facility and the fact that it would require similarly substantial investment by taxpayers, it may still be too early to call Foxconn's Michigan plans a done deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the manufacturer does come to Michigan, though, it will enter one of the most autonomous vehicle-friendly states in the US. In December 2016, Gov. Rick Snyder signed into law a bill that makes the state more permissive to the testing of self-driving cars on its roads than nearly all other states. Autonomous vehicle developers are already taking advantage. In late July, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735133" target="new"&gt;Magna International and Continental piloted a self-driving car&lt;/a&gt; that drove between Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. This fall, Ann Arbor residents will see &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734742" target="new"&gt;autonomous shuttles built by Navya&lt;/a&gt; navigating the University of Michigan campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, this Foxconn story remains one to watch. But given the size and influence of the company and the motivation on the part of Michigan to be a leader in the self-driving car space, it certainly seems more likely than not to happen in some capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In the automotive space, the economies of scale of legacy automakers allow them to enjoy certain privileges that are out of reach of most startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent challenges, OEMs still generate a lot of revenue, which, in turn, gives them the ability to invest capital in many projects -- including high-risk ones -- without putting their businesses in grave danger of failing. Automakers also have enormous fleets, which allows them to test new technologies or services in a large number of vehicles relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New ventures aren't without their own advantages, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startups can be far more nimble than century-old automakers, allowing them to pursue new innovations and to pivot operations faster to adapt to changing market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that an OEM's advantages can sync up directly with a startup's disadvantages -- and vice versa -- it only makes sense that they'd choose to partner up to plug those gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been an increasing amount of press around the number of deals between automakers and smaller companies in recent months, and new empirical &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/23/automakers-accelerate-their-interest-in-startups/" target="new"&gt;data from Crunchbase&lt;/a&gt; quantifies just how much that is true. Here are the big takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Car companies are investing far and wide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the graph shows, automakers did not make more than six venture or seed investments in startup in any individual year from 2012 to 2015. But that trend shifted dramatically in 2016, when 26 such investments were publicly announced. And it isn't slowing down. In just three quarters of 2017, there have already been 38 separate disclosed rounds of investments by major automakers. As Crunchbase reporter Joanna Glasner points out, these investments haven't been concentrated in any one area.&lt;/p&gt;

{image 1}

&lt;p&gt;"We see sizeable rounds, for instance, for &lt;a href="https://shift.com/" target="new"&gt;Shift&lt;/a&gt;, a car-selling platform; &lt;a href="https://www.chargepoint.com/" target="new"&gt;ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of electric vehicle charging stations; &lt;a href="https://turo.com/" target="new"&gt;Turo&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of peer-to-peer car sharing; &lt;a href="https://www.store-dot.com/" target="new"&gt;StoreDot&lt;/a&gt;, a battery developer and &lt;a href="http://www.momentum-ai.com/" target="new"&gt;Momentum.ai&lt;/a&gt;, an autonomous-driving startup," writes Glasner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;German automakers lead the way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Between them, BMW and Daimler (the parent company of Mercedes-Benz) have participated in 29 investments since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw in the three deals that Volkswagen has been involved in, and Germany's Big Three has made more deals than every other automaker combined. Not coincidentally, these outfits were largely involved in making investments long before their counterparts. BMW iVentures was founded in 2011 to invest "in cutting-edge solutions focusing on BMW's current and future business in the technology and customer and service space," and the company moved quickly with a $5 million investment &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/25/bmw-teams-up-with-invests-5-million-in-mycityway/" target="new"&gt;in MyCityWay&lt;/a&gt; in February of that year. The firm has stayed active since, participating in two rounds announced as recently as September for companies &lt;a href="http://www.thebanksreport.com/blog/fair-scott-painters-latest-venture-officially-launches/" target="new"&gt;Fair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dspconcepts.com/" target="new"&gt;DSP Concepts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably absent from this chart are Fiat Chrysler, Nissan and Mazda which have hesitated to get into the venture capital game. Even the notoriously independent Tesla has participated in a round, for electric motorcycle manufacturer &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2017/01/29/tesla-founders-backed-alta-motors-unveils-new-electric-motorcycle/" target="new"&gt;Alta Motors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it remains to be seen how these investments will pan out. And the wide distribution of capital is indicative of traditional VC funds, which tend to have a diverse portfolio of companies with the hope that the one outfit that hits it big will outweigh the ones that don't succeed. But even taking an approach like that is a significant step for OEMs, and shows that they are willing to do what it necessary to influence mobility going forward.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;This past May, Delphi Automotive announced that it would spin off its powertrain systems division into its own company, which would become independent and public. The electronics and safety and electronic architectures businesses would also form their own company to focus on connected car technologies and self-driving systems, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At a time of unprecedented industry change, the underlying strength of both our operating businesses and strategic partnerships will allow each company to focus even more sharply on its unique opportunities, continue to develop the very best advanced technologies, and help our customers navigate the road ahead," &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/" target="new"&gt;Delphi&lt;/a&gt; President and CEO Kevin Clark &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-announces-plans-for-tax-free-spin-off-of-powertrain-segment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months went by without further news on the split, but an announcement in mid-September signaled that greater specifics were imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company had &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-achieves-major-milestone-towards-completing-powertrain-systems-spin-off" target="new"&gt;secured&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of millions of dollars in financing to subsidize the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, on September 29, more specific details emerged when the names for the two new entities were revealed. The powertrain systems company will be known as Delphi Technologies, while the remaining software-focused company will go by the name of Aptiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The names Aptiv and Delphi Technologies clearly reflect the independent identities, visions and directions of the two companies, each a global leader in its industry," &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-automotive-announces-post-spin-off-names" target="new"&gt; noted Clark&lt;/a&gt;, who will remain CEO of Aptiv when the two companies officially split in March of next year. "Both will continue to embody Delphi's core themes of safe, green, and connected, with the autonomy and expertise to react to the rapidly changing dynamics in the automotive industry and solve its customers' most complex challenges. Customers, employees, partners and shareholders will benefit from the separation into two independent and well-resourced companies with the flexibility to invest and grow even faster and more profitably than today."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With unique and industry-leading work on vehicular autonomy, Delphi has become a fixture in the self-driving car industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, the company &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/bmw-intel-and-mobileye-bring-delphi-in-on-their-self-driving-platform/" target="new"&gt;joined&lt;/a&gt; the self-driving consortium that features big-name autonomous vehicle players like BMW, Intel and Mobileye. Fiat-Chrysler has since joined the project to design a self-driving platform, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Aptiv's innovative work on connectivity and autonomy may make its powertrain counterpart seem old fashioned by comparison, it is far from the case. According to Liam Butterworth, who will be the CEO of Delphi Technologies, the company is hard at work on forward-thinking electric vehicle technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The entire Delphi Technologies organization is energized to move forward as a focused company," Butterworth noted in a statement. "We are uniquely positioned with the technical competency and execution capability to deliver advanced vehicle propulsion systems that help our customers meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards while unlocking the power to support the ever-increasing electrical content being added to vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These goals are both exemplified and realized in Delphi's work to develop &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736022" target="new"&gt;backup power systems&lt;/a&gt; for the electric vehicles of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As electric vehicular architecture and vehicular autonomy are designed and refined in the coming years, electric and autonomous vehicles will intersect frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though Aptiv and Delphi Technologies will be two separate companies going forward, it's very likely they will still have a lot of business to work on together.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the future of automobiles, a comfortable, personable experience is a must. However, with so much data going in and out of these cars, security is also a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;a href="https://www.gemalto.com/"target="new"&gt;Gemalto&lt;/a&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, which is based in the Netherlands but also has a US headquarters in Austin, is bringing its knowledge of smart cards, security tokens and managed security services into the connected car and autonomous vehicle market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Gemalto &lt;a href="https://www.gemalto.com/press/Pages/Gemalto-empowers-smartphone-based-digital-vehicle-key.aspx" target="new"&gt;secured a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Mercedes Benz. The luxury car manufacturer is using the company's Trusted Services Hub (TSH) platform to let drivers use their smartphones as car keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"End-to-end, point-to-point security is a big feature of where we want to play here, whether that is enabling OTA [over-the-air] updates because software needs to be digitally synced, or through infrastructure that allows you to check and verify keys prior to accepting that software to avoid malware and other potential vulnerabilities," Kate Migon, head of sales for Americas Automotive &amp; Mobility Services at Gemalto, said during a recent interview with The Connected Car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There's also sending virtual keys down to a mobile phone and storing them on the mobile phone securely, while that person is needing to access the vehicle," Migon added. "And it also extends into how can we provide additional, multiple factors of authentication to make sure that not only is it the right person who signed up for the service, but it's the correct person who's in the car as well."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While security is an essential part of connected cars, especially as data travels vehicle-to-vehicle, and from vehicle to the cloud, there are also opportunities for Gemalto and its partners to provide a more personalized, tailored experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Once you know who's entering the vehicle, you can create a unique experience within that vehicle," Migon said. "Maybe there are radio presets that already have their Spotify account. The seat has been adjusted to their preferences based on previous rentals. And we're just looking at creating that entire experience for the user, so it's more like their own vehicle, versus something that they've rented and are only using for a short period of time."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing use of electronic SIM or eSIM technology, which is replacing traditional SIM cards, also offers greater security and flexibility. Gemalto, one of the world's largest suppliers of SIM cards, is embracing eSIM to build a single identity for the users of connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We can utilize eSIM additionally as a secure element or a trust anchor to be able to host other things, such as certificates and tokens as we are talking about this entire personalization piece," Migon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an enabler of technology, Migon notes that Gemalto is in a position to partner with different OEMs, as well as rental car companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemalto's is looking to deploy its technology into future markets where rental car companies control large fleets of autonomous vehicles and there's a need to connect those cars with customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Enabling those experiences for people, even when they're riding in their vehicle, so that you know who's entering the car and how you can provide a unique entertainment experience for them while they're in the car, could be a new ways of utilizing those same types of technologies in a new use case," Migon said.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For investors interested in the automotive space, these are heady times, with a tremendous number of interesting business opportunities -- and an equal number of potential busts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Segments of the industry including connected car technology, self-driving cars and electric vehicles -- or any combination of the three -- have exploded in recent years, although that growth is nothing compared to what is projected to take place in the years to come. That bright future doesn't make it easier to pick the specific companies worthy of financial backing. The space is new, crowded and largely unproven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding on individual plays still involves a lot of guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many, the idea of betting on the overall category sounds far less risky than backing individual stocks in the AV, EV or connected car sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a first-of-its-kind exchange-traded fund offering from Canada's &lt;a href="https://evolvefunds.com" target="new"&gt;Evolve Funds&lt;/a&gt;, that type of investment is now possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduced on the Toronto Stock Exchange on September 29, the Evolve Funds Automobile Innovation Index ETF (trading under the symbol, CARS) and the Evolve Active Canadian Preferred Share ETF (DIVS) allow investors the opportunity to hitch their wagon to various parts of the supply chains for electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and connected cars in a single investment product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, a US dollar version of the offering will become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe there's a place for active and passive ETFs in client portfolios," Evolve president and CEO Raj Lala wrote in &lt;a href="https://evolvefunds.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Marketing-PR-CARS-DIVS-29.09.17.pdf" target="new"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The Evolve Automobile Innovation Index ETF has been designed to give Canadian investors access to an exciting passive investment opportunity provided by the transformation of the automobile, and the Evolve Active Canadian Preferred Share ETF will give investors access to an actively managed portfolio of preferred shares sub-advised by Foyston, Gordon &amp; Payne Inc."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial offering includes 32 equally-weighted stocks that span the broad range of industries and sub-industries that have found themselves in the thick of developing the automobiles of tomorrow. &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com" target="new"&gt;Delphi Automotive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html" target="new"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; rank among the bigger-name companies whose stocks are included. Battery makers, semiconductor manufacturers and autonomous system designers comprise some of the other enterprises involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're not trying to pick the one or two winners," Evolve COO Elliot Johnson told Reuters. "We wanted to make sure we're making a bet that's broad, but also specific to the activities that are going on."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called "future car" exchange-traded fund is the third such offering from Evolve, and the industry is also a significant part of another &lt;a href="https://evolvefunds.com/product/cybr/" target="new"&gt;cybersecurity ETF&lt;/a&gt;. The same network capabilities that make connected cars such a game-changer can also make the technology vulnerable to hackers, a reality that has sent automakers &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735086" target="new"&gt;scrambling to employ&lt;/a&gt; cybersecurity experts. &lt;a href="https://www.symantec.com/solutions/automotive" target="new"&gt;Symantec Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, the highest-weighted holding in Evolve's cybersecurity ETF at 8.36%, is deeply involved in protecting the automobile of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When projecting five or ten years down the line, it's anyone's guess as to which particular companies will emerge as leaders in developing connected cars, electric cars and self-driving cars. But it's &lt;em&gt;everyone's &lt;/em&gt;guess that all three spaces -- and their intersections -- are substantial growth industries, making a wide-spanning investment seem like a smart bet.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are more than a few people who get anxious at the thought of driving a car in big cities, or flat-out refuse to do it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between bumper-to-bumper gridlock, confusing traffic patterns, cyclists zooming an inch from a car's window, and the constant blaring of horns, urban driving is an incredibly stressful experience. Suburban streets or a highway with clear lanes seem like an oasis by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of songs written about the open road, while there are very few odes to the joys of rush hour traffic in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If self-driving cars were able to feel stress, they would be similarly affected by urban environments. A driverless vehicle is forced to process far more information in a city than anywhere else. For some autonomous vehicle developers, this might be a reason to avoid testing AVs in cities, for fear of a mishap. But for CEO Kyle Vogt and his team at GM's &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt;, city driving represents a challenge and, more importantly, a valuable learning opportunity for their self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Testing in the hardest places first means we'll get to scale faster than starting with the easier ones," Vogt wrote in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@kyle.vogt/why-testing-self-driving-cars-in-sf-is-challenging-but-necessary-77dbe8345927" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; on October 3. "This may seem counter-intuitive, but by testing in densely populated areas we expose our software to unusual situations at a much higher rate, which means we can improve our software at a much higher rate. Based on our experience, every minute of testing in San Francisco is about as valuable as an hour of testing in the suburbs."&lt;/p&gt;

{image 1}

&lt;p&gt;Vogt says Cruise vehicles encounter "challenging situations" up to 46 times more than other AV test settings. Cruise keeps detailed and precise records of these interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a chart titled "Instances of various maneuvers per 1,000 miles of autonomous driving," Cruise vehicles in San Francisco make over five times as many lane changes as those in Phoenix, over 24 times as many passes in opposing lanes, encounter over 39 times as many construction sites that require navigation, and encounter over 46 times as many emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city really is more hectic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Dense urban areas contain more people, cars, and cyclists that our vehicles must pay attention to at any given time (and sometimes even raccoons)," writes Vogt. "Our vehicles predict the future motion of each object and simulate how those objects might interact with others. For example, we'll predict that the car in front of us will brake if it appears it's about to get cut off by a cyclist or that a car making a left turn in front of us will probably yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Deutsche Bank analyst Rod Lache &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/25/gm-developing-autonomous-vehicles-at-a-fast-pace-deutsche-bank-says.html" target="new"&gt;advised investors&lt;/a&gt; that GM was a current leader in AV technology, and that it would be among the first companies to put a fully self-driving car on the road in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Vogt's assertions that Cruise Automation has committed to testing in urban environments on a greater scale than any other AV developer would certainly seem to support those projections.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It's easy to forget that not that long ago, the dashboard space between the driver and passenger seats was occupied by a radio that required turning the dial &lt;em&gt;just so&lt;/em&gt; in order to get a particular station to come in clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the infotainment systems inside connected cars can navigate around traffic jams, conduct telephone calls and deliver entertainment options, from podcasts to satellite radio to streaming music services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as convenient as infotainment systems are, they still require attention from drivers to operate, and that can lead to dangerous distractions, according to new research released by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Some in-vehicle technology can create unsafe situations for drivers on the road by increasing the time they spend with their eyes and attention off the road and hands off the wheel," Executive Director Dr. David Yang in a &lt;a href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/2017/10/new-vehicle-infotainment-systems-create-increased-distractions-behind-wheel/" target="new"&gt;wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "When an in-vehicle technology is not properly designed, simple tasks for drivers can become complicated and require more effort from drivers to complete."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAA's study looked at 30 vehicle infotainment systems, and ranked each on a range from "low demand," the level of distraction imposed on a driver by listening to music or an audiobook, to "very high" demand, which is the equivalent of trying to balance a checkbook while driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were discouraging. Twelve of the systems tested were rated very high demand, 11 were classified as high demand, and seven were deemed moderate demand. No system was classified as low demand, the standard that AAA recommends for all infotainment systems comply with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These are solvable problems. By following NHTSA's voluntary guidelines to lock out certain features that generate high demand while driving, automakers can significantly reduce distraction," Jake Nelson, AAA's director of Traffic Safety Advocacy &amp; Research, noted. "AAA cautions drivers that just because a technology is available while driving does not mean it is safe or easy to use when behind the wheel. Drivers should only use these technologies for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving related purposes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know from other public education campaigns about distracted driving, such as texting while driving, the stakes are extremely high when people don't pay attention behind the wheel. And using an infotainment system is not inherently less distracting than using a cell phone. AAA found that completing tasks like sending a text message or programming a navigation system can take as long as 40 seconds for a driver, a time during which a car will travel the distance of four football fields -- and that's only going 25 miles per hour. The number of opportunities for disaster during these distracted time frames is scarily high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AAA Traffic Foundation for Safety isn't advocating that infotainment systems be eliminated entirely, merely that they be modified to prevent drivers from acting on their worst impulses. In the meantime, drivers should take it upon themselves to exercise restraint. There's no excuse for texting while driving, and activities like programming navigation systems and organizing a playlist should be done before a trip begins.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles represent a tantalizing long-term revenue stream for automakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many drivers, electricity will soon represent a cheaper fuel source than gasoline, which is just about the biggest possible motivator to get a consumer to switch what they drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Plus, concerns about the environment have already prompted many to switch to hybrid or electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is good reason to believe that when many customers purchase their next car in the future, EVs will be an increasingly attractive option. The problem is the present. Manufacturing EVs at scale without an established customer base has been a money-losing proposition for OEMs thus far, and it remains unclear when we'll hit a tipping point where the sale of electric vehicles is consistently profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;, company executives believe they've finally found their answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a meeting with investors at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York on November 15, General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced plans for the company to develop a completely new electric vehicle platform to launch in 2021. At least nine models will be developed through the platform, from a compact crossover to an SUV. Most critically, the venture will be a money-maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to a future electric vehicle portfolio that will be profitable," Barra said, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-ceo/gm-challenges-tesla-with-promise-of-profitable-electric-cars-idUSKBN1DF272" target="new"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For GM, the key to profitability is a cheaper battery. The battery system that will power the forthcoming platform will be more than 30% cheaper than the one currently installed in the Chevy Bolt, according to Barra. The battery will also also charge faster and provide longer range -- 300 miles between charges compared to the 238 in the Bolt, an increase of more than 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Paul Lienert and Nick Carey noted for Reuters, the subject of EV profitability is something of a loaded issue in the automotive industry, particularly because of &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Her plans represent a direct challenge to money-losing electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc., which is struggling to get its more affordable, high-volume Model 3 launched and recently reported its largest-ever quarterly loss," write Lienert and Carey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Barra's proclamations are bold, she's not the kind of leader that talks the talk without walking the walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"General Motors is a different company under Barra," Joann Muller wrote in a profile of the CEO for &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2017/05/02/mary-barra-is-running-gm-with-a-tight-fist-and-an-urgent-mission/#3c10a01f1bdb" target="new"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; in May. "Gone are the empty promises and arrogant bluster. With Barra at the helm, there's a quiet confidence that if GM just sticks to its plan, good will eventually come. It's a classic case of under-promising and over-delivering, as in the first quarter, when GM soundly beat Wall Street's expectations with a 33% jump in net income."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barra has clearly earned the right to be ambitious at GM, and she's taking advantage of it. While only 17,000 Bolts have sold so far, the automaker is predicting 1 million annual EV sales by 2026. If it achieves that type of scale, the category has the potential to do more than just eke out a small profit: it could start delivering a significant chunk of revenue to GM's bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;You can learn a lot about a country's personality by studying its approach to industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a nation whose government favors minimal regulation likely places a higher value on a free market than on protections for workers and consumers. But as national moods shift, legislative policy tends to shift alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an industry that is so new and, to most consumers, mysterious, self-driving cars serve as a fascinating litmus test for the countries where they are being developed. Certain governments may be hesitant to boost a technology that varies widely in quality from one company to another and promises to generate vocal critics because of its sheer newness alone. Other nations may want to show that they embrace cutting edge innovations and want to be seen as the home of the future of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politicians can be found everywhere along that spectrum. But with predictions that self-driving vehicles could reduce the number of traffic deaths by as much as 90%, many politicians and governments seem to believe that promoting AVs will put them on the right side of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the case for UK Chancellor Philip Hammond, who promised fully autonomous vehicles with no human drivers on Britain's roads by 2021 when he announced the nation's budget on November 22. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It will happen, I can promise you. It is happening already," Hammond said in an appearance on BBC Radio 4's &lt;i&gt;Today&lt;/i&gt; program, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/23/philip-hammond-pledges-driverless-cars-by-2021-and-warns-people-to-retrain" target="new"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. "It is going to revolutionize our lives, it is going to revolutionize the way we work. And for some people this will be very challenging."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Toby Helm at the Guardian, Hammond's well-documented enthusiasm for autonomous vehicles is part of a larger effort to appear optimistic about the British economy in the wake of the Brexit vote last year that set up Britain to leave the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The move -- welcomed by the UK motor industry -- is part of an attempt by Hammond and the Treasury to project a more upbeat message about the prospects for the UK economy after Brexit, and focus on opportunities as well as the risks," &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/19/self-driving-cars-in-uk-by-2021-hammond-budget-announcement" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Helm in the days before the full budget announcement. "Carmakers have warned that they may have to move at least some production abroad if there is no deal to keep Britain inside the EU single market and customs union, at least for a two-year transition period."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in Hammond's radio appearance, he took a cautionary tone for a good portion of the interview. He echoed one of the widest concerns about the emergence of autonomous vehicles, the idea that these cars will displace a great number of professional drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The challenge for us is making sure that the million-odd people in the UK who drive for a living, over the next ten, 20 years or so, as driverless vehicles come in, are able to retrain and re-skill so they can take up the many, many new jobs that this economy will be throwing up," Hammond said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believe that there will be significant overlap between self-driving cars and electric ones, and the UK &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/autumn-budget-2017-25-things-you-need-to-know" target="new"&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; announcement also included good news for EVs. The UK government will put an extra 100 million ($133 million) into subsidizing the industry, while also ensuring that all new homes come equipped with the proper cables to enable EV charging.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In the competition to break through in the autonomous vehicle market, different companies hold different advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As perhaps the earliest high-profile entrant into the space over ten years ago, Waymo -- then Google -- has what many consider to be the furthest-developed driverless cars, from software to hardware. Automakers, on the other hand, have the advantage of easy and extensive access to large fleets of vehicles, which will become even more important as the market matures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's the ride-hailing companies. Uber and Lyft have well-established brands and huge customer bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; was seen as the dominant force in ride-hailing in general and autonomous ride-hailing in particular. But after a series of missteps at Uber, &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; has gained substantial market share in the overall ride-hailing category and now seems to be making inroads in the self-driving sector as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, Lyft received a permit from the state of California to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lyft-selfdriving/lyft-wins-permit-to-test-self-driving-cars-in-california-idUSKBN1DM24I" target="new"&gt;test autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in the state. Lyft becomes the 45th entity to receive an Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permit from the California DMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An on-road testing permit -- in California or elsewhere --
 represents an important step for any self-driving car company. While software simulations and testing on private facilities can provide valuable learning for autonomous systems, there's no replacement for miles logged on public roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California law mandates that all autonomous vehicles must be monitored at all times by a human operator in the driver's seat, who sits ready to take over if the vehicle gets itself into trouble somehow. Companies are required to report the frequency with which these humans need to step in to control the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber, which has tested AVs in Arizona and Pennsylvania, received its permit to operate driverless cars in California in March of this year. In the time between then and Lyft receiving its permit, 18 permits have been issued to entities including Apple and Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automakers that have permits to test AVs in California include Mercedes-Benz, Tesla, Nissan, Honda and more. Volkswagen Group of America was the first company to receive a California AV testing permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lyft's acquisition of a license comes on the heels of a series of autonomous driving partnerships in recent months. In May, Lyft and Waymo agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/technology/lyft-waymo-self-driving-cars.html" target="new"&gt;collaborate&lt;/a&gt; on self-driving pilot projects. In September, Lyft unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736202" target="new"&gt;an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with Drive.ai to give autonomous rides to customers in San Francisco, similar to what Uber does with riders in Pittsburgh. Later that month, it was revealed that Lyft had also &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736849" target="new"&gt;teamed up&lt;/a&gt; with Ford to "take self-driving cars mainstream."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When ready, we'll have self-driving cars operating alongside Lyft's current community of drivers to help accommodate times of significant consumer demand to ensure that transportation remains timely and affordable," Sherif Marakby, Ford's vice president of autonomous vehicles, said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with an AV testing permit to enable its growing list of powerful partnerships, it's not just Uber that has to pay attention to Lyft: The whole AV world needs to take notice.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are a select number of brands with such great cachet that they can pretty much slap whatever price tag they want, and consumers will buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of Apple, which recently began selling the iPhone X at prices that &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; at $999 and had people lined up outside of its stores ready to fork over their money. Even though comparable smartphones sell for significantly less, Apple is able to convince customers that the design, functionality and quality of its products justifies the higher price point. Looking around at the number of people using Apple devices, it's hard to argue with that contention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; is another company that warrants inclusion on that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an innovator in electric and autonomous vehicle systems, the company represents a new kind of automotive company and it charges a premium for its leading edge approach. Despite the high price tags, Tesla's cars are overwhelmingly popular -- perhaps even &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/musk-model-3-tesla-production-delays/" target="new"&gt;too popular&lt;/a&gt; for the company's own good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, there were two safe bets to be made when Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738351" target="new"&gt;first introduced&lt;/a&gt; the company's electric Semi truck in November: It would be popular, and it would be expensive. While the initial announcement of the Tesla Semi did not include a price, recent developments shed light on the cost of the big rig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Semi's &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/semi/" target="new"&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt; was updated in late November to include the truck's "expected base price" as $150,000 for a model with a 300-mile battery range and $180,000 for a model with a 500-mile range. Those looking to reserve a Semi -- the release of which isn't expected until 2019 -- need to pay a $20,000 fee upfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a standard diesel semi truck starts around $80,000, but can reach $150,000 or more depending on the number of options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla's prices are listed below a "fuel savings" figure of $200,000+, a not-so-subtle suggestion that the Semi will pay for itself thanks to the projected savings from switching from diesel to electric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Musk outlined in his introduction of the vehicle, cost savings are just one benefit.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Semi is also expected to outperform current diesel truck models. Tesla claims the Semi can travel at 65 mph up a 5% grade, and will go from zero to 60 mph in 20 seconds while carrying an 80,000-pound load. There are also design upgrades. Most notably, the driver's seat will be positioned in the middle of the cockpit "like you're in a racecar," Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truck appears to be delivering in the popularity category, as well. While the total number of orders Tesla has received is not available, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-truck/tesla-truck-gets-dhl-order-as-shippers-test-semi-idUSKBN1DS2MF" target="new"&gt;Reuters reports&lt;/a&gt; that shipping companies like DHL, Wal-Mart and J.B. Hunt have already reserved Semis. Wal-Mart ordered 15 of the trucks, and DHL ordered 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the small order sizes from companies with enormous fleets, and given that the product won't be available until 2019 (or even later, given Tesla's penchant for pushing back deadlines), it's safe to infer that these orders weren't the result of black-and-white bottom-line calculations. Instead, companies want Teslas for the same reason the rest of us want Teslas: it's a shiny new thing.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology, the same system that backs cryptocurrency transactions such as Bitcoin, is believed to have the potential to revolutionize connected vehicles and automated driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is essentially an immutable, distributed public ledger where transactions or other data can be stored. Each entry or "block" is connected to previous entries using cryptography, linking all of the blocks together in an immutable chain.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the connected car industry, this means that data can be appended to the blockchain to give vehicles a decentralized digital identity. This will transform the way connected cars communicate with other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. And with it comes new and improved capabilities for insurance, vehicle history, ride sharing services and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology has the potential to not only expedite our path to automated vehicles, but it also opens the door for multiple connected car use cases today. Let's take a look at a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Enabling smart contracts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
One of the biggest benefits of blockchain is that the technology enables smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially programmatic code that can be executed on the blockchain. They can allow for the exchange of money, goods or services in a conflict-free way without the use of a middleman. &lt;/P&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;This is huge for OEMs, telecom providers and insurance companies. A consumer could digitally purchase a connected car and drive off the lot in a matter of minutes. An oil change could be purchased by the vehicle and operationalized almost instantly. And insurance and toll payments could be made seamlessly and instantly by the vehicle.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Supporting V2X and V2I capabilities, and automated driving&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
As we begin to realize the potential of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2X) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technologies -- the capabilities that allows cars to talk to each other and objects around them -- blockchain could be a key enabler.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With blockchain technology, OEMs could benefit from quicker, more secure data transfers than are possible today. Every transmission would be traceable. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ridesharing services could also benefit from more secure data transfer, location tracking and seamless payment between the passenger and the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we look ahead to fully automated vehicles, information or currency could be exchanged between vehicles, infrastructure and other IoT devices via the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Each of these use cases will benefit current connected car functionalities and will also allow fully automated vehicles to become even closer to a reality. With blockchain, a car could refuel, park and then pay for those &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-move-self-driving-cars-fast-lane/"target="new"&gt;services all on its own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Overcoming barriers to adoption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Though blockchain is meant to provide an immutable public ledger, the technology itself still faces a few obstacles. Information privacy and device identity are still at risk as hackers can impersonate or have access to consumer data if a device's private keys are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, lack of general awareness and some industry skepticism will slow blockchain adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can overcome these barriers, however, the realized benefits and use cases of blockchain will only continue to increase for IoT and connected car.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;First things first, let's clear up some confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartcar is not the Daimler subsidiary that produces those economical microcars that have room for two passengers, a steering wheel, and not much else. Though they make cars, that company, founded in 1994, is officially known as simply Smart, one word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartcar, on the other hand, is a Mountain View-based startup founded in 2014 that is developing a connected car platform. It can be debated how "smart" it is to start a company with a name so easily confused with another known entity, but there is clearly an appeal to being perceived as smart in the automotive space, although what that means has certainly evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young startup, &lt;a href="https://smartcar.com/" target="new"&gt;Smartcar&lt;/a&gt; is relatively unknown. Prior to a presentation at November's Los Angeles Auto Show, the company's sparse website featured only a single blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after a major announcement at the Auto Show, it seems likely we'll be hearing a whole lot more. In LA, Smartcar revealed it had struck up &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/english-releases/hyundai-blue-link-and-smartcar-team-up-to-build-an-expanded-infrastructure-for-the-connected-car-300562644.html" target="new"&gt;a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt; to connect the automaker's vehicles with various types of businesses to make life easier for car owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartcar will use its connected car platform to add the infrastructure for new services to &lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/bluelink/index.aspx" target="new"&gt;Blue Link&lt;/a&gt;, Hyundai's existing connected car service. Currently, Blue Link can be used to for controlling certain features such as remote locking/unlocking/starting and climate control, as well as to provide on-demand vehicle diagnostics reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with Smartcar, Blue Link will be able to do a whole lot more. Utilizing the location services and remote lock/unlock services, Smartcar will enable services such as grocery delivery or gas fill-ups to a parked car, even when the owner isn't present. The joint presentation at the LA Auto Show specifically referenced &lt;a href="https://www.washos.com/" target="new"&gt;Washos&lt;/a&gt;, an on-demand car washing and cleaning service, as a third party that will participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Apps are a fundamental differentiator for car owners. Smartcar and Hyundai are advancing the creation of an ecosystem of apps and services for connected vehicles," said Smartcar CEO and co-founder Sahas Katta in a statement about the pilot program that will launch in California early in 2018 under the name Blue Link All-Access. "This partnership will bring unique experiences to Hyundai vehicle owners."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyundai is not the first high-profile collaboration that Smartcar has participated in. In June, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.smartcar.com/smartcar-launches-connected-car-platform-in-germany-d631d821536a" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; an agreement with BMW Group to launch its connected car platform in Germany for "applications [that include] insurance, expense tracking, smart home, gas stations, and mobility services."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking towards a future in which our roads are full of self-driving cars, many imagine that vehicles eventually will drive themselves to the grocery store or gas station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Blue Link All-Access, Smartcar and Hyundai are offering a connected car solution that is effectively the same. Doing errands in the palm of your hand has long been a fantasy of people waiting in long lines at grocery stores, and it's now a reality for Hyundai owners in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, it could be the norm for all car owners.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The automobile has always represented an appealing space for advertisers primarily because it is home to a captive audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With television, advertisers rightly worry that their targeted viewers will go to the bathroom, grab a snack, read their phones or simply fast forward with their DVR during a commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drivers, with their attention necessarily focused on the road ahead of them, have no such alternatives. They can always change the radio station or fast forward their podcast, but that forces them to be distracted from their primary task -- driving -- and they are generally more content to simply listen to the ad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology has advanced and the emergence of the connected car has defined this decade in automotives, the car cockpit has grown substantially more appealing to marketers. The specificity, relevance and customization that marketers can offer on connected car platforms can make their ads all the more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the thinking behind &lt;a href="https://www.telenav.com/" target="new"&gt;Telenav&lt;/a&gt; recently launching a connected in-car advertising platform for automakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telenav's offering consists of a connected software system that will actually serve the ads in vehicles as well as the rest of the in-car advertising value chain. This means that, for automotive OEM clients, Telenav will perform everything from ad targeting to ad sales to campaign management, in addition to the delivery of the ads themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Connected, intelligent cars provide OEMs with new opportunities to roll out innovative features and services," Telenav CEO HP Jin noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.telenav.com/press-releases/2018-january-4" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Telenav's In-Car Advertising Platform provides an exciting new opportunity for OEMs to monetize connectivity to cover service costs and even drive healthy profits while enriching the consumer experience with safely-delivered, engaging and relevant offers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant is a key term here, and perhaps the most significant value add that Telenav promises over existing in-vehicle advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging information provided by the connected car ecosystem like geographic location, destinations, and frequently traveled routes, Telenav's system can improve the likelihood that ads will appeal to the drivers that are hearing them. A driver heading home in the evening, for example, could be prompted with a coupon offering a discount for a family-sized pizza deal. Gas stations could choose to target advertisements towards nearby vehicles that are running low on fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety is another critical component of Telenav's platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737102" target="new"&gt;study by AAA&lt;/a&gt; showed that most existing infotainment systems can be dangerously distracting for drivers. That won't be so with ads served by Telenav. Ads will only appear when a vehicle is at a full stop, and will automatically disappear when a driver propels the car into motion or interacts with other elements of the infotainment system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ads can still be annoying, and undoubtedly the connected car advertising systems of the future will upset a few drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if there's one thing that makes being sold something more tolerable, it's the fact that the item being sold is actually something you need. And that is exactly what Telenav is offering with its new in-car ad platform.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, a self-driving car could operate using only a suite of sensors that detected objects such as other cars, pedestrians, and road markings. It would, however, be incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensors would need to perform at a higher level than they are currently capable of and could not slip in performance in adverse driving conditions. And every time a driverless car traveled a route it would be as if it was doing so for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why so much work is being done in the realm of HD mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building digital, three-dimensional road maps for autonomous systems is the ideal companion to sensors, with each making the other's job easier. But building these maps is no easy feat either. Mapping all the world's roads at a high resolution is an enormous task, and that's without even mentioning the fact that these maps need to be continually updated to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mobileye.com/en-us/" target="new"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt;, the Israeli automotive sensor company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735423" target="new"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" target="new"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; for $15.3 billion last year, may be approaching a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CES, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that 2 million vehicles from BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen are now equipped with Mobileye technology to perform the data collection necessary to build three-dimensional maps for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe that crowdsourcing is the only solution," said Mobileye CEO and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who Krzanich brought on stage during his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlJ9zB74G_U" target="new"&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt; speech. "Cars equipped with Mobileye cameras and chips act as data collectors, as harvesters. They continuously update high-definition maps, and we call this data collection Road Experience Management, or REM."&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;In the past, most mapping was done from the top down -- think Google Street View vehicles that systematically map neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Intel's approach does is to transform any car equipped with Mobileye's technology into a mapping device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data that will be used to generate these maps will be harvested by Mobileye 8 Connect, the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that provides safety technology to drivers and connectivity features to fleet owners. Remarkably, the system that will build these maps -- which can be retrofitted onto any car -- consists of just a single camera sensor and the so-called "EyeQ" processing system that accompanies it. In retrofitted cars, this system sits on the exterior of the windshield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mobileye, its uses extend beyond consumer and private sector applications. Cities also could generate incredibly valuable data from Mobileye 8 Connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NfqVpTFFSXo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Not only does it provide lifesaving warnings to the driver, it also silently observes and collects critical and actionable data for your city," the company said in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfqVpTFFSXo" target="new"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. "With expected applications like traffic light and sign identification, infrastructure deficiency and accident hotspot detection, and even free parking space recognition, Mobileye 8 Connect can be a key element in making your city safer and smarter."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Mobileye 8 Connect expected to launch later later this year, Intel is on a path toward becoming the leader in 3D HD maps for autonomous vehicles, which could make it an increasingly necessary partner for all AV developers.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For almost three years, Android phone users have had an easy way of -- safely -- accessing many of the functions on their devices while driving. By connecting their Android phones to their cars, they could use voice commands or a driver-friendly touch display interface for navigation, entertainment and communication apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those services were all part of &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/auto/" target="new"&gt;Android Auto&lt;/a&gt;, an app developed by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/" target="new"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; that is compatible with more than 400 models of cars from more than 40 brands, including Ford, GM and Volvo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CES 2018 earlier this month, Google delivered some good news for users of the app: Google was beefing up the app with the addition of Google Assistant, the high-functioning voice recognition technology that will now be able to service drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOcMSsuppV4rCYbz-ufx4DyXNKBCzOjOp" target="new"&gt;A series of videos&lt;/a&gt; from Android, demonstrate some of what Google Assistant will offer drivers, all while allowing them to keep their eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one video -- "Plan your day" -- a driver asks the system what her schedule is for the day. Google Assistant informs her of a 10:00 a.m. meeting and a 1:00 p.m. lunch date. She also asks her Google Assistant to navigate her to work and the system immediately pulls up turn-by-turn directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rz00UQ3dQyE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment apps are also easily engaged with Google Assistant via Android Auto. In another video, a driver requests to listen to her Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify. When she doesn't recognize the artist, she asks Google Assistant who the artist is and receives a concise response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a long list of useful services, although not a particularly groundbreaking one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in stories from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16860338/google-assistant-android-auto-support-update-ces-2018" target="new"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2018/01/09/google-assistant-now-android-auto-apparently-wasnt/" target="new"&gt;Android Police&lt;/a&gt;, the user experience will not change drastically. Google Voice search had powered much of the functionality in earlier versions of Android Auto, but now the app will receive the complete functionality possible with Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While asking for directions and dictating messages were possible without Google Assistant, the addition does present some new possibilities. It will be easier to establish personal preferences. You won't need to ask Google Assistant to play a song "on Spotify," as it will already know that is your preferred app for music. The ability to control Internet of Things (IoT) devices is also new. For example, users will be able to adjust the lights in their home from their car. Some users are excited about the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Actually, the lack of full [Google Assistant] in Android Auto has been driving me insane," writes commenter Quinton in the top-voted comment on the Android Police post. "I keep asking how late a store is open, for example, and voice search just gets massively confused. This will be better."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's plenty of competition in the in-vehicle voice assistance space, as hands-free functionality is more important in an automobile than perhaps any other setting. By enhancing what Android Auto can do with the addition of Google Assistant, Google has made a small but important improvement to a product that is already popular among Android users.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley was a hub of innovation long before the days of Tesla, Facebook or eBay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seeds of Silicon Valley's reputation were planted by the universities and governmental research facilities that pre-dated "big tech" companies by a significant margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such research facility was the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) that was first established in 1939. When NASA was created in 1958, the NACA facility was renamed the Ames Research Center, or NASA Ames. Over its nearly 80 years of existence, NASA Ames has done important research on propeller-driven aircrafts, spaceflight technology, and information technology that have been incorporated on missions to space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html" target="new"&gt;NASA Ames&lt;/a&gt; remains on the cutting edge of technological research, and the fruits of that research are finding applications here on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CES, NASA and &lt;a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; announced that they were extending a pre-existing agreement to jointly research and develop future autonomous mobility services. The companies also unveiled plans for a "working demonstration" of those services that will take place in Silicon Valley some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement between Nissan and NASA Ames was first established &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames/from-rovers-to-self-driving-cars-nasa-ames-and-nissan-north-america-sign-agreement" target="new"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally framed as an umbrella deal that would allow for partnerships "in autonomous vehicle systems, robotics, human-machine interface, software analysis/verification and network-enabled applications."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CES 2017, the partners revealed their largest project to date: an autonomous driving platform fleet solution known as Seamless Autonomous Mobility, or SAM. According to Nissan and NASA said, SAM was built on some of the same technology that was used to operate the Mars Rover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is not only a demonstration of the transfer of space technology to industry, but also the application of their research back to our space technology, with additional uses for our unmanned aircraft systems research. This is a perfect example of technology literally driving exploration and enabling future space missions," NASA Ames director Eugene Tu &lt;a href="http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/press-kit-nissan-intelligent-mobility-at-ces?query=nasa+ames+seamless+autonomous+mobility" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcements were a little less concrete at this year's event, but it was clear that Nissan hopes to have SAM on the road in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We built SAM from technology NASA developed for managing interplanetary rovers as they move around unpredictable landscapes," Maarten Sierhuis, director of the Nissan Research Center in Silicon Valley, wrote in a &lt;a href="http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/channels/us-united-states-nissan/releases/nissan-and-nasa-extend-research-into-autonomous-mobility-services" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Our goal is to deploy SAM to help third-party organizations safely integrate a fleet of autonomous vehicles in unpredictable urban environments, for example ride-hailing services, public transportation or logistics and delivery services. The final stage of our existing research agreement with NASA will bring us closer to that goal and test SAM in a working demonstration on public streets."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the autonomous vehicle sector grows, most experts anticipate that autonomous ride-hailing services will slowly begin to replace personal vehicle ownership.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the mobility-as-a-service space figures to be quite crowded indeed. For Nissan, having the cachet of the NASA name attached to its product may help separate the automaker from its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Maryland-based venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates' portfolio includes many businesses that are working in future-leaning markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those is Jet.com, which is a leader in e-commerce. Another investment, Opower, is described on NEA's website as an "energy efficiency software-as-a-service company offering an analytics platform that enables utilities to communicate with residential customers about energy usage." Legacy industries these are not. It may come as somewhat of a surprise, then, that NEA's latest investment is in a more established field: trucking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://www.nea.com/" target="new"&gt;NEA&lt;/a&gt; did not back a business-as-usual shipping and logistics company. Instead, the VC firm led a $42 million Series C financing round for &lt;a href="http://transfix.io/" target="new"&gt;Transfix&lt;/a&gt;, a New York startup that leverages machine learning to power advanced software that facilitates freight shipping for both carriers and shippers. Fellow VC firms &lt;a href="http://www.canvas.vc/" target="new"&gt;Canvas Ventures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://lererhippeau.com/" target="new"&gt;Lerer Hippeau Ventures&lt;/a&gt; joined NEA in the round, and the Series C money brought Transfix's total capital raised up to $78.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The services that Transfix offers for trucking companies are valuable ones that are not typically bundled together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An online truckload marketplace lets businesses find the right carrier based on a variety of factors, including price and geography. Once their product is out on the road, companies receive real-time tracking of their cargo. Eventually, shippers and carriers receive analytics that give them insight into their performance and suggestions for cost-saving measures. It's all about efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of misinformation in the freight industry which creates pressure, impossible -- and sometimes dangerous -- deadlines, misdeliveries, and ultimately the failure to satisfy customers," Transfix founder and CEO Drew McElroy &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/transfix-raises-42-million-series-c-led-by-nea-300486608.html" target="new"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "It's a problem that's ecosystem-wide, not just limited to a single part or parcel. That's why we're focused on providing a comprehensive solution for the supply chain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For NEA, aligning with Transfix represents yet another investment in the future of mobility and commercial trucking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VC firm recently led a $34 million Series B &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734301" target="new"&gt;round of fundraising for Swift Navigation&lt;/a&gt;. The tech company provides GPS products that are accurate down to the centimeter and it offers real-time tracking of various types of vehicles, both industrial and consumer. It's the type of technology that will be essential in the development of self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEA also has investments with companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2017/06/28/nea-leads-50m-round-in-u-s-autonomous-driving-technology-start-up-drive-ai" target="new"&gt;Drive.ai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/drones-autonomous-vehicles-on-echodynes-radar-as-it-pulls-in-29m-from-investors/" target="new"&gt;Echodyne&lt;/a&gt;, both of which produce technology for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734426" target="new"&gt;Einride aiming to have fleets&lt;/a&gt; of self-driving freight trucks on the road by 2020, many believe that these types of vehicles could be on the road in large numbers long before consumer autonomous vehicles. It's clearly a possibility that NEA has considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As we have invested in technologies that enable an autonomous future, we believe it is important to consider near-term adoption and use cases because full autonomy for consumer vehicles is a long way off," NEA associate &lt;a href="http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2017/07/14/how-nea-envisions-the-future-of-trucking-transportation-and-a-i/" target="new"&gt;Arjun Aggarwal told Xconomy&lt;/a&gt; in talking about the Transfix round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe that the $726 billion trucking and logistics industry is one that will be disrupted by autonomous technologies in an accelerated fashion relative to others simply due to the massive costs and inefficiencies that characterize the market, along with up-ended consumer delivery expectations," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, this belief that trucking will be the first vehicular sector to fully implement autonomous tech could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If VCs such as NEA believe that to be true, their large financial investments will help make it so.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Of the hurdles that stand in the way of a future of roads full of driverless cars, some are obvious, such as overcoming consumer resistance to a radically disruptive technology. Other obstacles, however, are more obscure and most people won't be aware of them until long after the issue has been solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these obscure roadblocks was done away with earlier this month, as the US Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-unlocks-new-airwaves-vehicular-radar-use" target="new"&gt;expanded the amount of radio spectrum&lt;/a&gt; available to connected cars on the road. By adding four gigahertz, the FCC effectively doubled the bandwidth available to vehicles' radar applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, cars only had access to the 24GHz band and the 76GHz band. Now, they will be able to use the span from 76GHz to 81GHz. The 24GHz range will no longer support connected car technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While we enthusiastically harness new technology that will ultimately propel us to a driverless future, we must maintain our focus on safety -- and radar applications play an important role," &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/07/13/next-gen-car-technology-just-got-another-big-upgrade/?utm_term=.3147a06229b5" target="new"&gt;Mignon Clyburn&lt;/a&gt;, a Democratic commissioner for the FCC, wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed they do. Radar technology is not only essential to the self-driving cars of tomorrow. It already operates many of the functions of semi-automated cars that are on the road today. Radars guide automated braking, pedestrian detection, self-parking features, and lane change warnings, among other components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vehicular radar systems can improve our driving experience and help our families stay safe," &lt;a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/fcc-expands-us-connected-car-spectrum-allocation/" target="new"&gt;FCC chairman Ajit Pai&lt;/a&gt; wrote in a statement. "Access to this contiguous block of spectrum will allow for new innovations and the expansion of potentially life-saving vehicular radar technologies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, it will help manufacturers of connected cars make their technology transferable across national borders. Offering the 76GHz to 81GHz band to connected cars is consistent with the practices of other countries. By aligning itself with those international standards, the US is making life a lot easier for OEMs developing autonomous vehicle technology that does not need to be entirely revamped when it's ported to other countries. It's an especially significant development for an industry that many believe will take different shapes in different regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you develop a technology that only works in a single city, where it's kind of optimized for a specific city, that's not really that exciting," nuTonomy CEO &lt;a href="https://theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734565" target="new"&gt;Karl Iagnemma told Forbes&lt;/a&gt; recently. "The fact is, one of the dirty little secrets I would say, is that the software today is pretty city- or country-specific."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Iagnemma went on to describe how factors from varying road markings to different social attitudes towards pedestrians all affect how companies must tailor their AV software to different regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, those challenges remain. But in widening the spectrum of airwaves available to connected car radars, the FCC has opened the door further for the international development of AV technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever federal legislation addressing the regulation of self-driving cars took the first formal step toward becoming law on Wednesday, when the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted unanimously to approve a bill that will enable thousands more autonomous vehicles to take the road and prevent individual states from restricting those freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/subcommittees/commerce-manufacturing-and-trade-115th-congress" target="new"&gt;The Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection panel&lt;/a&gt; is comprised of 24 members -- 14 Republicans and ten Democrats. The members of the subcommittee drafted this legislation and, now that it's been approved, the House Energy and Commerce Committee at large could vote on the bill as early as next week. If it receives another affirmative vote there, it will hit the House floor in September after a recess. Most believe the bill will receive revisions as it makes its way through the legislative process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While we have not reached a complete bipartisan agreement, the draft before us reflects true bipartisan negotiations," panel member &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-19/self-driving-cars-get-boost-with-unanimous-vote-by-house-panel" target="new"&gt;Frank Pallone (D-NJ) said&lt;/a&gt;, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill's two main goals are to get more self-driving cars on the road for testing, and to preempt states from creating stricter legislation that would tighten the ability of companies to pilot self-driving cars within their borders. With regards to the former, the bill acts aggressively. Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can grant 2,500 exemptions per year for individual vehicles to circumvent its normal safety standards which, among other things, require cars to have human drivers. Many of these exemptions are given to self-driving cars being tested in states like Michigan, Arizona and California. The bill passed by the panel would expand that number from 2,500 to 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to the latter goal, &lt;a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF17/20170719/106309/BILLS-115pih-HighlyAutomatedVehicleTesti-U2.pdf" target="new"&gt;the bill&lt;/a&gt; makes its intentions clear from the outset: "No State or political subdivision of a State may adopt... any law, rule, regulation, duty, requirement, standard... related to the design, construction, mechanical systems, hardware and software systems, or communications systems of... is identical to a standard prescribed under this chapter," it reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the bill passed unanimously among both Democrats and Republicans in the subcommittee, there are critics on the outside who don't believe the federal government should undercut states' abilities to regulate within their own borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Preempting the states' ability to fill the void left by federal inaction leaves us at the mercy of manufacturers as they use our public highways as their private laboratories however they wish with no safety protections at all," John Simpson, Privacy Project director at Consumer Watchdog, &lt;a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/newsrelease/consumer-watchdog-calls-california-representatives-oppose-congressional-robot-car-legisl" target="newk"&gt;wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democrats are looking to ensure that the federal safety standards will be rigorous enough to erase some of those worries. One particular focus is on cybersecurity, where Dems want to make sure that entities operating autonomous vehicles have strong cybersecurity in place. Their urgency is shared by at least one industry leader, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2017/07/17/tesla-fleet-hack-elon-musk/" target="new"&gt;as Elon Musk recently said&lt;/a&gt; that preventing a "fleet-wide hack" was an enormous concern for both Tesla and the AV industry at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With safety on everyone's mind, subcommittee chairman Bob Latta (R-OH) issued a reminder that the subject was, in fact, the primary driver behind this self-driving car legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Why is all of this important? One word: Safety," &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/subdccp-members-unanimously-advance-self-driving-legislation-during" target="new"&gt;Latta said&lt;/a&gt;. "We don't have to accept a world where millions of accidents and thousands of fatalities on the roadway are a necessary evil of driving. In a nation of over 320 million, each year approximately 6 million Americans are involved in vehicular accidents, resulting in nearly 2 million injuries."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons, investing in a company that creates technology for self-driving vehicles, and self-driving vehicles only, is largely speculative. Even the most advanced businesses in this market have a long way to go before perfecting their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there's plenty of uncertainty around when legislation will make our autonomous vehicle future a reality, and how specific rules and regulations will shape that landscape. Further, it's anyone's guess what that future will look like from a business perspective. Will legacy automakers achieve vertical integration for the production of self-driving cars, or will Silicon Valley disrupters claim the space as their own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all this uncertainty, it hasn't prevented money from flowing in as evidenced by auto tech startup &lt;a href="https://www.nauto.com/" target="new"&gt;Nauto&lt;/a&gt;'s recent announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/7/19/15992974/self-driving-driverless-car-tech-nauto-greylock-softbank-reid-hoffman" target="new"&gt;a $159 million Series B financing round&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The round was led by Silicon Valley VC firm Greylock Partners and Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank Group. Toyota AI Ventures, General Motors Ventures and BMW iVentures also participated, as did the insurance company Allianz Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company is reportedly using its partnerships with Toyota, GM and BMW to develop self-driving car technology, the chatter attached to the recent fundraising focused on Nauto's current portfolio of products, as well as how the company can make roads safer today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Nauto uses inward-facing car cameras, advanced AI technology, and analytic coaching software to track driving behavior and help correct it. The technology is especially adept at detecting -- and, eventually, correcting -- distracted driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"SoftBank and Greylock, along with our key strategic partners, are turbo-charging Nauto's ability to make roads safer today and to create an onramp to autonomy for the near future," &lt;a href="https://www.nauto.com/newsroom/autonomous-vehicle-company-nauto-raises-159-million-series-b-round-led-by-softbank-and-greylock-partners" target="new"&gt;Stefan Heck&lt;/a&gt;, Nauto's founder and CEO, wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
"At a time when traffic fatalities are climbing and distracted driving causes more than half of all crashes, we're tackling that problem by putting Nauto's safety features into more commercial fleet vehicles -- from trucks and vans to buses and passenger cars -- to warn drivers and coach them on how to stay focused," Heck added. "And, in pursuit of the profoundly transformational impact autonomous vehicle technology can have on business and society, we'll now more rapidly be able to gather the billions more miles of real driving experience and data required to get a precise understanding of how the best drivers behave behind the wheel."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the future, driving will be a networked activity, with tighter feedback loops and a much greater ability to aggregate, analyze and redistribute knowledge," Greylock partner Reid Hoffman wrote. "By building a network of vehicles and drivers, Nauto is accelerating the transition from a human-driver dominant world to a safer, more efficient autonomous-driving era."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Hoffman and SoftBank partner Shu Nyatta will join the Nauto board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Allianz Group's involvement suggests, Nauto's products also raise intriguing possibilities for insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nauto's software could help drivers lower their premiums by teaching them to drive safer, and the video and data generated by the company's cameras could help insurers handle accident claims more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're currently in something of a transitional moment, where limited testing of self-driving car technology can take place on open roads, but no one has much of an idea when autonomous vehicles will achieve widespread consumer adoption. As a company that is helping bridge that gap to a driverless future, it's no wonder that so many different entities are excited to be involved with Nauto.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;IBM is looking to loan out its security expertise to the automobile industry with a new set of consulting and other services that looks to secure, test and protect connected cars and autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the Black Hat conference this week in Las Vegas, &lt;a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/52863.wss"target="new"&gt;IBM's X-Force Red division&lt;/a&gt; announced it would create a whole practice solely dedicated to securing connected cars. Big Blue has been working with about a dozen auto makers, as well as third-party suppliers, to build up expertise, as well as penetration testing and consulting services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=664"target="new"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; auto division will look to secure not only hardware and software within connected cars, but the applications and networks that feed data into these vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Over the past year, we've seen security testing further emerge as a key component in clients' security programs," Charles Henderson, global head of IBM X-Force Red, wrote in a statement Monday. "Finding issues in your products and services upfront is a far better investment than the expense of letting cybercriminals find and exploit vulnerabilities."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the automotive division, IBM X-Force Red plans to launch another division to secure Internet of Things (&lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=14&amp;p_id=22"target="new"&gt;IoT&lt;/a&gt;) devices. Since this is IBM, the company plans to leverage its Watson IoT Platform to help partners with the testing and deployment of IoT sensors and other connected devices, as well as the apps used within these ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Programmatic and on-demand security testing through the entire lifecycle of the products is emerging as the best way to find vulnerabilities in a proactive fashion," according to IBM's July 24 statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With nearly 250 million connected cars expected to hit the roads in 2020, according to a 2016 &lt;a href=" "target="new"&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; estimate, IBM is looking to leverage one area of expertise that it has -- security -- that other players in the autonomous and connected car market lack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As other tech companies look to push their way into the connected car market, the industry can expect these legacy giants to leverage their knowledge to carve out spots for themselves within this field. For IBM, it's security and cognitive computing to start. For others, such as &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=723"target="new"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, it's leveraging the software company's huge &lt;a href="http://www.enterprisecloudnews.com/author.asp?section_id=571&amp;doc_id=731506"target="new"&gt;patent portfolio&lt;/a&gt; to provide the intellectual underpinnings for automakers to build artificial intelligence and other technologies into the vehicles themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since IoT and connected cars are closely linked, it makes sense that IBM would want to announce both security offerings together. In addition, with millions of connected devices coming online, it's a greenfield for a company such as IBM to offer services ranging from security consulting to penetration testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last several years, IBM has looked to move away from its legacy businesses to other areas. During its latest &lt;a href="http://www.enterprisecloudnews.com/author.asp?section_id=571&amp;doc_id=734693&amp;"target="new"&gt;earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, the company missed revenue estimates, but showed some steady growth in its cloud computing business, although some analysts are warning that its various Watson cognitive computing offerings are not matching up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Most people understand the "autonomous" part of the phrase "autonomous vehicles" as it relates to driving. Self-driving cars can navigate to a destination without requiring a human behind the wheel -- pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what if a car were autonomous in every sense of the word? What if it not only knew when it needed more gas, but drove itself to the gas station to refuel without being told? What if it recognized that it needed repairs and could perform the work itself? And what if a car could securely pay for all of these processes without any human interaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of autonomous car future is very much in play, according to &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/consumer-industrial-products/Blockchain_AutomotiveFinance.pdf?ReillyBrennanFoT" target="new"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html" target="new"&gt;Deloitte Consulting&lt;/a&gt; titled "Blockchain @ Auto Finance: How blockchain can enable the Future of Mobility." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that may be unfamiliar with the term -- or may have only heard it in relation to the cyber-currency Bitcoin -- the report defines blockchain as "a digital, chronologically updated, massively duplicated and cryptographically sealed record of data transfer activities within a network of participants." Essentially, blockchain is a method of digital record-keeping that is extremely secure because it is not stored centrally and each entry cannot be retroactively modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the secure nature of transactions and the authenticity of the data, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity. That, of course, will include autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we are seeing today is that a lot of automotive companies, captives, and fleet management companies are experimenting with blockchain, but it's still at very early stages," Deloitte partner Sebastian Pfeifle, an author of the report, &lt;a href="http://www.autofinancenews.net/where-the-blockchain-tipping-point-for-auto-finance-lies/" target="new"&gt;told Auto Finance News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the possibilities blockchain presents for everyone in the connected car space -- manufacturers, sellers, owners and service providers -- are immense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte presents several use cases for blockchain with regards to autonomous vehicles: identity management, payments, vehicle history, finance and operations. The report first addresses identity management, and the tension between an increased desire for data from fleet managers and an increased resistance to sharing data from users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Blockchain can intervene on both sides of the equation," says the report, before describing how blockchain will allow users to selectively and securely share data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the ability of a car to pay for its own servicing may sound like a futuristic luxury, the authors of the Deloitte report see it as more of a necessity. "Any automobile must be capable of managing the transactions that take place while consumers are using it, both to send and to receive funds," they write. The security that blockchain promises will make purchases made by automobiles more secure than current forms of electronic payment, and such an arrangement will also conveniently reduce the time drivers spend, say, paying for gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other benefits described in the report include unimpeachably accurate records of car history -- think Carfax, but way better -- expanded loyalty programs and facilitated back-office operations. All look set to make an impact on the future of the automotive sector, and will likely lead to a greater and greater role for blockchain going forward that should benefit OEMs and drivers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The conditions that brought about a favorable market for machine-to-machine (M2M) connections technology did not happen overnight. While using the Internet has been a part of day-to-day life for over a decade now, the near-ubiquity of high-speed wireless Internet throughout most of the country and in other parts of the world is a more recent development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the proliferation of 4G and LTE technology is essential for the viability of M2M products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A once-skeptical regulatory environment has also become more favorable. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is considering a proposal to make the inclusion of vehicle-to-vehicle technology compulsory in all cars manufactured starting in 2023. That confluence of events has M2M technology poised for takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/machine-to-machine-market-732.html" target="new"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; by research firm Markets and Markets, the wireless technology market is set to experience its highest period of compound annual growth (CAGR) between 2017 and 2023, as the still-young market matures into a powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M2M technology represents a particularly promising subsector of this industry, as the report predicts that it will experience a CAGR of 4.6% during that time, which would lead it to become a market worth $27.62 billion by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report takes a broad scope, zeroing in on various wireless markets around the world and examining how varying technological infrastructures, regulatory environments and social conditions are changing the market. It covers a broad swath of industries, including healthcare, utilities, retail, consumer electronic, security and surveillance. But the report focuses heavily on auto and transportation, as this represents wireless technology's most fruitful end-user industry going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The automotive and transportation sector held the largest share of the M2M connections market compared to other end-user industries in 2016," &lt;a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/machine-to-machine1.asp" target="new"&gt;a summary of the report&lt;/a&gt; states. "The increase in the demand for embedded telematics in cars and Wi-Fi-based GPS trackers for remote fleet monitoring, coupled with Bluetooth in-car connectivity for vehicle infotainment, is expected to drive the growth of the wireless M2M connections market for the automotive and transportation end-user industry."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why the automotive industry represents such a promising market for wireless technologies is so obvious that it often goes unstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more than any other consumer or industrial product that incorporates electronics, cars are fundamentally "wireless." Up until recently, a car could not be "connected" in the way that a home, office, hospital or public space could be -- its very nature of being untethered meant that it couldn't latch onto wired, stationary systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4G and LTE technology has already eliminated that problem to a large degree, as navigation systems, music streaming services and more allow drivers to access technological services that were previously unavailable on the go. As this technology develops further in the coming years, those possibilities of mobile connectivity will only grow in scope and become more widely relied upon.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In the United States, self-driving cars are, for the most part, embraced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OEMs are developing safe autonomous vehicles. Government regulators are writing legislation that will foster innovation. As things unfold there will be consequences. Thanks to the free time that soon-to-be ex-drivers will have when they can take their eyes of the road, entertainment industries are finding new ways to fill the time in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there's also good reason to believe that many jobs will be lost as well. The trucking industry, which employs 3.5 million drivers in America alone, figures to cut a large portion of its workforce as automated trucks make their way into commercial fleets. Despite the downsides, the autonomous vehicle revolution progresses forward in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We won't allow driverless cars in India," Nitin Gadkari, the country's union road transport and highways minister, &lt;a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-allow-driverless-cars-that-take-away-jobs-says-union-minister-nitin-gadkari/story-JCDjBMoDQ4yzXrWv3ltxsK.html" target="new"&gt;told the media&lt;/a&gt; on July 27. "I am very clear on this. We won't allow any technology that takes away jobs. In a country where you have unemployment, you can't have a technology that ends up taking people's jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment and jobs are hot topics in Indian political discourse. But reliable data on just how bad the situation is is hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stats on unemployment can shift dramatically from year-to-year, and analyses are often used to show discrepancies between India's rural and urban areas. It's also common for political groups to present unemployment rates in a way that &lt;a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fact-check-bjp-claims-unemployment-rate-falls-data-contradictory-unreliable/story-7qfd6zuNrM73gorYGMVOwO.html" target="new"&gt;serves their agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, India is struggling to provide enough workers for the commercial driving sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is short 22,000 drivers in the country. The government is also planning to open 100 driver training schools throughout India, with a goal of adding 5,000 commercial drivers to the industry within the next five years, according to Gadkari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the current shortage of drivers calls into question the necessity of preemptively banning autonomous vehicles for the purpose of maintaining jobs. If anything, the development of self-driving cars would seem to be a desirable addition to the country's roadways from an economic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues of safety would seem to be a more valid concern in India, even if they went unmentioned by Gadkari. India's roads are known for dense, unpredictable traffic patterns -- a series of conditions that would make it quite difficult for a self-driving car to operate effectively. Ex-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Google CEO Sundar Pichai &lt;a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/in-india-there-wont-be-any-driverless-cars-google-ceo-sundar-pichai/1/850059.html" target="new"&gt;have both spoken about the difficulty&lt;/a&gt; of designing autonomous vehicles for Indian streets in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Gadkari's comments did not seem to introduce or reference any official policies from the Indian government that are imminently forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, pending legislation in India's parliament explicitly seeks to promote the development of self-driving cars. Considering the aforementioned congestion on India's streets, however, it would figure to be many years before autonomous vehicles would hit the road, even if an aggressive approach were taken.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If you were driving around California or Michigan, and you passed what you suspected is a self-driving car, the first thing that might tip you off would be a spinning, semi-conical device atop the car. Known as Lidar (light detection and ranging), this sensor technology serves as the primary way that autonomous vehicles "see" their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every second, Lidar sensors send out millions of laser pulses that bounce off nearby objects, allowing a self-driving car's software to build a constantly refreshing three-dimensional map of its environment. Camera sensors then help an autonomous vehicle interpret the objects that the Lidar is gauging, and the vehicle navigates itself accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while many consider Lidar to be the key to ultimately making self-driving cars a reality, it is also one of the biggest barriers. The reasons are twofold and interconnected. First, Lidar technology isn't good enough yet to sufficiently guide fully autonomous vehicles. Second, Lidar technology isn't cheap enough yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge presented by the former compounds the difficulty of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A car traveling at highway speeds approaches upcoming objects at a faster rate than a car traveling at 25mph. To safely travel at speeds of 65mph or faster, a car would need to be equipped with high-powered Lidar that extends its lasers to great distances, giving the autonomous driving system a sufficient amount of time to process the information and react.&lt;/p&gt;
{image 1}
&lt;p&gt;"Low-speed applications may be more affordable more quickly than higher-speed ones," &lt;a href="https://www.oxbotica.ai/" target="_blank"&gt;Oxbotica&lt;/a&gt; CEO Graeme Smith told &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608348/low-quality-lidar-will-keep-self-driving-cars-in-the-slow-lane/" target="new"&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;. "If you want a laser that's operating over 250 meters, you need a finely calibrated laser. If you're working in a lower-speed environment and can get by with 15 meters' range, then you can afford [to use] a much lower-cost sensor."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no viable autonomous vehicle will only navigate at school zone-level speeds. And cost remains a limiting factor even in the low-end tech. Lidar manufacturer &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/products.html" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt; sells its least powerful sensor for $8,000, a figure that would be prohibitively expensive for mass production of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress, however, is being made both with regards to Lidar capabilities and price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velodyne touts its forthcoming &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170419005516/en/Velodyne-LiDAR-Announces-%E2%80%9CVelarray%E2%80%9D-LiDAR-Sensor" target="new"&gt;Velarray&lt;/a&gt; sensor as ensuring "safe operation in L4 and L5 autonomous vehicles" at "a target price in the hundreds of dollars when produced in mass volumes." &lt;a href="http://quanergy.com/" target="new"&gt;Quanergy&lt;/a&gt;, one of Velodyne's competitors, announced that it would begin production &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170314/MOBILITY/170319926/quanergys-%24250-lidar-to-be-produced-later-this-year" target="new"&gt;on a $250 Lidar system&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidar is not the be-all and end-all for autonomous vehicles. Industry leader &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; doesn't &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2016/11/02/tesla-no-plan-for-lidar-self-driving-cars/" target="new"&gt;even use the sensors&lt;/a&gt;. But nearly every other self-driving car OEM does, so the technology's capability and affordability will undoubtedly shape how the industry progresses in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Historically, the relationship between driver and auto mechanic has been a sacred one. People won't entrust their car -- one of their most valuable and necessary possessions -- to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knowledge that a repairman will do a good job diagnosing and fixing a problem &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; charge a fair price provides invaluable peace of mind to the customer. The amount of time people spend reading Yelp reviews and soliciting word-of-mouth advice when they need to find a new mechanic shows how essential these relationships are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of operating an auto repair shop has evolved significantly this millennium. The in-vehicle diagnostics introduced to all new vehicles give repairmen a whole new way to approach servicing automobiles. Instead of popping the hood and looking around, mechanics now hook a car up to a computer that can suss out issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A much bigger change appears to be on the horizon, however, and it's one that has auto repair shop owners on their toes and more than a little anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recently published &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1054261/the-connected-car-of-the-future-could-kill-off-the-local-auto-repair-shop/" target="new"&gt;feature for Quartz&lt;/a&gt;, Sarah Kessler described the forthcoming conditions that, if addressed a certain way, could leave repair shops out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Some worry that eventually, services like GM's Onstar could share data they receive from connected cars with local GM dealers, who offer repairs and maintenance service, but they won't necessarily share this type of information with... [the] 180,000 independent auto repair businesses in the United States, which could leave them at a disadvantage," writes Kessler. "Or worse, manufacturers will move data that shops need to fix cars, some of which is currently accessible by the OBD port, to these new connected systems, where it will be less accessible to independent businesses."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the hype around connected cars touts the way in which they will improve the actual driving experience with features like improved navigation services and, eventually, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, an enormous part of the value of connected systems comes from how they facilitate the repair and servicing of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cars now self-diagnose a wide range of problems, even anticipating necessary and routine parts replacements ahead of time. These capabilities could be a boon for repair shops under the right circumstances, but the shops' uncertainty as to whether they'll be able to access the necessary data has them worried about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A whole $300 billion-plus industry -- we'd be up a creek," says one shop owner quoted in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kessler outlines two possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, individual manufacturers could license the collective data of all their vehicles to the entities that want to use them, from repair shops to insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option, which Kessler says that auto shops and parts dealers prefer, is that "independent registration authorities" would regulate the flow of data, which would work on a car-by-car basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While auto body shops are seemingly more vulnerable in an uncertain future, every non-OEM participant in the automotive economy harbors some anxiety about their position in a landscape that will be dominated by connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealerships fear that &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735049" target="new"&gt;over-the-air updates&lt;/a&gt; to connected cars will compromise their position as providers of parts and services. In a certain sense, these entities -- dealerships, parts dealers, auto body shops -- should be comforted by the fact that they're all in somewhat precarious positions together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When everybody has something to lose, they're more likely to compromise to find a solution that works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;While the average connected car owner might not even be familiar with the term "telematics," there's probably many features and services they've come to rely on in their vehicle that depend on the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-car navigation and remote lock/unlock are just two examples of telematics services that benefit the average driver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fleet managers, however, access to telematics services is more than just a convenience: it's essential for maintaining an efficient, cost-effective and safe operation. A telematics product would be a no-brainer purchase for most fleet managers even if it just offered location services. An owner of many vehicles needs to know where those vehicles are. Of course, telematics services for fleets offer so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another player has entered the fleet telematics space to help expand the technology's potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Become the master of your fleet," &lt;a href="https://business.t-mobile.com/" target="news"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; is telling fleet managers, with its SyncUp Fleet product. Individual SyncUp Fleet devices are plugged into each vehicle's on-board diagnostics port, then usage of those vehicles can be tracked and analyzed in a multitude of ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company seems to be more upfront with its pricing than most fleet tracking services, saying that SyncUp Fleet will be available for $3 a month on a 24-month equipment installment plan, and that there will be a $15 a month mobile data plan per vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Un-carrier team is unstoppable," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.t-mobile.com/news-and-blogs/narrowband-iot-network.htm" target="new"&gt; T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray&lt;/a&gt; wrote in a announcement, employing the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/22/how-t-mobile-usa-ceo-john-legere-is-changing-the-ceo-game.html" target="new"&gt;enthusiastic style&lt;/a&gt; for which the company's executives have become known in recent months. "Not only have we built America's best unlimited network, but this magenta army is also moving at a breakneck pace to support the future of connected devices in a 5G world. Our IoT customers can rest well knowing their tech is future proof with the Un-carrier."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile touts several uses for its SyncUp Fleet service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is to save time. By having a bird's eye view of all of the vehicles in a fleet and access to data such as arrival times, gas tank levels and traffic reports, fleet managers can delegate their resources in the most efficient way possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also improve their employees' driving habits by utilizing the risk and safety reports automatically generated and provided by SyncUp Fleet. The service provides similar reports with regards to efficiency, and also analyzes diagnostic information to predict necessary repairs and servicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we move deeper into the 21st-century world of automotives, shipping and delivery services are only one of the types of fleets that will avail themselves of telematics products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ride-sharing services have the potential to be an even greater customer base, with fleets that can grow into the thousands. Be it T-Mobile or someone else, the company that is able to build the killer telematics app for ride-share fleets is likely to be a force for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of potential hurdles along the road to a future in which autonomous vehicles dominate our roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the two that are brought up most frequently are the limits of developing technology and the regulations that exist on testing driverless cars. The reality, though, is that the latter is becoming less of a concern than the former. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, legislative and regulatory bodies on the national level have been quite friendly towards the self-driving car industry, and more than a few state governments have been actively enthusiastic in promoting AV testing within their borders. As we look forward, things only look rosier on the regulatory front for the AV sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That belief was further confirmed this month, when US Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Cho unveiled "A Vision for Safety 2.0" -- a set of guidelines for AV developers devised in a joint effort by the DoT and the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

As the title indicates, it's an updated version of a previously released set of guidelines. And fittingly -- considering the fast-changing nature of the industry it's addressing -- Chao notes that a third version of the document is already slated for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The new Guidance supports further development of this important new technology, which has the potential to change the way we travel and how we deliver goods and services," &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/us-dot-releases-new-automated-driving-systems-guidance" target="new"&gt;Chao noted&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. "The safe deployment of automated vehicle technologies means we can look forward to a future with fewer traffic fatalities and increased mobility for all Americans."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines are divided into two sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Section 1, which is entitled Voluntary Guidance, lays out 12 priority safety design elements for OEMs and other contributors to autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Entities are encouraged to consider each safety element in the design of their systems and have a self-documented process for assessment, testing, and validation of the various elements," &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf" target="new"&gt;according to the document&lt;/a&gt;. The safety elements described fall under subsections like "Object and Event Detection Response," "Validation Methods" and "Data Recording." Each subsection describes a general set of best practices for the corresponding area of AV technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 2 -- called Technical Assistance to States -- describes a similar set of best practices for the bodies regulating these designers of self-driving cars: federal regulators, state regulators, legislatures and state highway safety officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As the technology grows and the horizon of [autonomous driving systems] changes rapidly, it is essential for each of these entities and interested parties to exercise due diligence in staying ahead of activity in a proactive -- rather than reactive -- manner," according to that document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cautionary in tone, the new set of guidelines is largely positive in its characterization of autonomous vehicle technology, even with regards to its still-developing nature. It approaches the issue with safety as its foremost priority, noting that driverless cars have the potential to make our roads markedly less dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The major factor in 94 percent of all fatal crashes is human error," Chao writes in the introduction. "So [autonomous driving systems] have the potential to significantly reduce highway fatalities by addressing the root cause of these tragic crashes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other work by the federal government on AVs in the news recently has been even more positive, namely the bill unanimously passed by the House that is known as &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736110" target="new"&gt;the SELF DRIVE Act&lt;/a&gt;. With the DoT and the NHTSA ostensibly representing the toughest governmental hurdles to clear for self-driving cars, the fact that they are (cautiously) paving the way comes as fantastic news to the AV industry.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The foremost business priority of an insurance company is to mitigate risk for its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes for insurers of all kinds: Health insurance companies don't want their customers engaging in dangerous behavior that harms their health, such as smoking. Home insurers want to make sure that your house is built on a solid foundation so that it can withstand damage from a natural disaster. And auto insurers, of course, don't want their customers getting into car accidents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munich Reinsurance America has taken a proactive step in this direction, and an innovative one at that. Munich Re, US has partnered with Israeli vision-safety technology firm &lt;a href="https://www.mobileye.com/" target="new"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt; to offer a new physical product known as an Advanced Collision Avoidance System to its clients. The product is largely targeted towards commercial fleets, which would buy the new offering to make their operations and drivers safer and figures to save costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As Americans drive more miles and engage in activities that take their attention off the road, such as texting and talking on cellphones, the number of traffic crashes and fatalities has grown," &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170912005580/en/Mobileye-Munich-Announce-Collaboration-Reduce-Automotive-Collisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Mike Scrudato&lt;/a&gt;, senior vice president and strategic innovation leader at Munich RE, US, noted in a statement. "Adding a crash avoidance system to a company's risk management program for its fleet of vehicles can help mitigate the risk of a crash. Our partnership with Mobileye offers our client companies and their customers with a range of fleet vehicles -- from auto to light- and heavy-duty trucks to buses -- tools to help reduce property losses and help save lives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical system consists of two connected physical components: a high-resolution vision sensor that gets mounted on the windshield, and a visual display unit for the driver to look at inside the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Mobileye's state-of-the-art, industry-leading visual sensor algorithms, the product is able to determine risky traffic situations before a driver would be able to recognize them himself. When necessary, it notifies the driver of those situations and gives them enough time to change course accordingly and avoid a potential accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The ability to improve driver habits with real-time feedback coupled with reinsurance protection will provide companies with a well-rounded risk management solution for their fleets that improves road safety for everyone," Moran David, general manager for Mobileye US and Canada, wrote in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobileye was officially &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735423" target="new"&gt;acquired by Intel&lt;/a&gt; in August for $15.3 billion dollars. Along with Intel, Mobileye is part of arguably the most &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735698" target="new"&gt;powerful consortium&lt;/a&gt; in the world of autonomous vehicle R&amp;D, one that includes BMW, Fiat-Chrysler and Delphi Automotive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in such a powerful partnership, Mobileye's sensor tech -- the same used in the new offering from Munich Re, US -- stands out as one of the most valuable assets. It won't be surprising if other insurance companies start following Munich Re, US's lead, which could be very good for Mobileye's business prospects going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There's a reason that you rarely see large corporations involved in litigation that comes to trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For corporations, having the inner workings of their operations on display in a public courtroom can do enormous damage to their reputation and their bottom line, which is why so many corporate lawsuits end in settlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is one of the things that makes the lawsuit between Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google parent company Alphabet, and fellow AV giant Uber so unique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case centers around Anthony Levandowski, who was an important member of Google's autonomous vehicle team and allegedly downloaded thousands of technical documents before quitting to launch the self-driving truck startup Otto, which was subsequently acquired by Uber for $680 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo alleges that Uber is now building technology using documents that were unlawfully stolen from them. As the trial has made its way through the courts, it has provided rare opening into how both companies operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report from Mark Harris &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/google-has-spent-over-11-billion-on-selfdriving-tech" target="new"&gt;at IEEE Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; dove deep into a court filing from Waymo's lawsuit against &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/pittsburgh/self-driving-ubers/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, and found a fascinating financial figure for Project Chauffeur -- the name for the Google self-driving car project that ultimately came to be known as Waymo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Between Project Chauffeur's inception in 2009 and the end of 2015, Google spent $1.1 billion on developing its self-driving software and hardware, according to a recent deposition of Shawn Bananzadeh, a financial analyst at Waymo," writes Harris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While $1.1 billion may seem like a huge number, it actually indicates a remarkable level of efficiency considering how much Waymo has accomplished in the autonomous vehicle space over an extended time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, General Motors &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/pittsburgh/self-driving-ubers/" target="new"&gt;bought Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; for over $1 billion last year. Ford invested a similar figure in &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/02/10/ford-invests-in-argo-ai-new-artificial-intelligence-company.html" target="new"&gt;startup Argo AI&lt;/a&gt; in February, and Intel announced a whopping &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735423" target="new"&gt;$15.3 billion purchase&lt;/a&gt; of sensor company Mobileye this past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with its relatively tame spending, Waymo has emerged as a leader in self-driving car technology. If they can hold onto that pole position as the technology comes to market in years to come, that initial investment will look tiny relative to the profits they'll rake in.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Some companies' products are so ubiquitous that you often use them without even realizing it. Other companies produce baseline technologies that power the products of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel's products fit into both categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though very few consumers could tell the difference between two microprocessors, it's a good bet that an Intel one is powering at least one of your devices. Intel's processors are a big part of what what make Dell, HP and Apple computers so impressive. Intel provides the technology behind the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not all that surprising, then, that designers of a self-driving car would also want to use Intel processors for the incredibly complex software systems that power autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was still headline-grabbing news when Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the company was partnering with &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; to provide technologies for "sensor processing, general compute and connectivity" for the company's self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As Waymo's self-driving technology becomes smarter and more capable, its high-performance hardware and software will require even more powerful and efficient compute," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/waymo-intel-announce-collaboration-driverless-car-technology/" target="new"&gt;Krzanich wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post. "By working closely with Waymo, Intel can offer Waymo's fleet of vehicles the advanced processing power required for level 4 and 5 autonomy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the vast amount of information that a self-driving car needs to process, analyze and convert into physical action within fractions of a second, it's imperative that an AV be equipped with high-powered and dependable processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As the most advanced vehicles on the road today, our self-driving cars require the highest-performance compute to make safe driving decisions in real-time," Waymo CEO John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/18/waymo-taps-intel-for-self-driving-computers-it-develops-entirely-in-house/" target="new"&gt;told TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "Intel's technology supports the advanced processing inside our vehicles, with the ability to manufacture to meet Waymo's needs at scale."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735423" target="new"&gt;made official&lt;/a&gt; its purchase of &lt;a href="http://www.mobileye.com/en-us/" target="new"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt;, buying the industry-leading sensor company for a staggering $15.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two companies, now one, join BMW, Fiat-Chrysler and Delphi Automotive in a powerful partnership, the members of which are hoping to establish an industry-standard operating platform for autonomous vehicles. As EE Times Chief International Correspondent Junko Yoshida writes, it's unclear how Waymo fits into this arrangement, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When the mating elephants won't offer important details about their union, I struggle to understand what exactly is the news here. Are the elephants bonding or merely flirting?" &lt;a href="http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;amp;_mc=RSS_EET_EDT&amp;amp;doc_id=1332313&amp;amp;page_number=2" target="new"&gt;wrote Yoshida&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The mission of the BMW-Intel-Mobileye partnership is to 'build a platform that other automakers can use,' according to [an] Intel spokeswoman. Waymo is not, evidently, one of those other automakers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little more detail does come from a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-autonomous-waymo/intel-collaborates-with-waymo-on-self-driving-computer-design-idUSKCN1BT1Z4" target="new"&gt;Reuters report&lt;/a&gt; that Intel is providing a "custom piece of silicon," to address Waymo's "sensor fusion needs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this new partnership is not unique in its opacity. As with many developments in the autonomous vehicle space, we'll learn more as time goes on, but not before the companies want us to.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges for any new tech industry is finding a workforce with the skills required to operate in a sector that previously did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes significant upfront investments of time, education and money to get workers up to speed. In the emerging field of self-driving cars, it's not surprising then that this is a particularly pronounced challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, it's a wide field with many different players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different job opportunities at some of America's biggest automakers and tech companies. The top of the Fortune 500 list is littered with companies that have autonomous vehicle ambitions, and they're all competing to fill a large number of positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it isn't a field in which anyone can walk in off the street and get a job. Specific and advanced skills are required. It goes without saying that not just anyone can build a car that drives itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former leader of Google's AV project (now known as Waymo), Sebastian Thrun, saw this supply-demand issue up close and, after leaving Google, he decided to do something about it. Thrun launched &lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="new"&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt;, an online vocational school of sorts that offers "nanodegree" programs for those looking to acquire skills in the hopes of entering the self-driving car industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the way that Code Academy trains anyone to become a web developer, Udacity hopes to do the same for autonomous vehicle engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udacity got a major boost in September, when it was announced that the company was partnering with &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; to provide funding for 400 scholarships for students to receive certification in the engineering of self-driving cars via an introductory nanodegree program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is a significant talent shortage in this new burgeoning area of self-driving cars," Lyft chief strategy officer Raj Kapoor &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/09/19/self-driving-car-godfather-to-train-lyft-engineers-offer-flying-car-classes/#1d22f3ba6d3e" target="new"&gt;told Forbes&lt;/a&gt;. "Sebastian is considered the godfather of self driving and helped to put the curriculum together, so it gets people the basics and off the ground right away."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key phrase here is "the basics."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Udacity's programs have been geared towards accomplished engineers or programmers who were experienced in related fields. Through the new Lyft-sponsored program, beginners will have the opportunity to gain access to work in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When we launched Self-Driving Car, we thought it was more of a niche product, because very few kids go to college thinking 'I want to become a self-driving car engineer,'" Thrun &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/udacity-adds-a-new-intro-to-self-driving-cars-nanodegree/" target="new"&gt;told TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "But it became this unbelievably successful thing for us, not just from a student perspective, but also from an industry perspective. But the one complaint we got from lots of our student base was 'Look, this is really tough.'... With the program we have right now, you have to be a really good software engineer just to get through it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Kapoor, the scholarships will target demographics that are disproportionately absent in tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Technology is not as diverse as we would like, especially around underserved communities, whether it's by gender, like women, or if it's by race, for example African-Americans and Hispanic Latino communities, and Native Americans -- all those are below the percentage of the population in terms of representation," he told TechCrunch. "And so we felt like, is there a way to get some of those people attracted into this, why don't we give away 400 scholarships over the next year targeted to those people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarships will cover the $800 value of the course, which begins October 10 and will last for four months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its &lt;a href="https://take.lyft.com/open-platform/" target="new"&gt;own ambitions&lt;/a&gt; in autonomous vehicles, it wouldn't be a surprise to see some Lyft-sponsored Udacity graduates go on to become actual Lyft employees down the road.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For Pittsburgh residents who rode in Uber's first generation of self-driving cars, the experience of being in the autonomous vehicle may not have actually &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; like being in an autonomous vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was largely due to the fact that both the driver's seat and the passenger's seat of the autonomous vehicles were occupied by vehicle technicians from the ride-sharing company when the program started last September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's mandated by law that at least one person be inside all self-driving cars and be able to take over in the event of a malfunction, but Uber had a second individual stationed in the passenger's seat to provide additional monitoring of its cars' autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the vehicles have indeed been piloting their passengers to work, dinner or kickball practice, the actual ride experience featured more human involvement than a normal Uber ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That experience, though, will soon become closer to true self-driving, as &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; announced a new fleet of self-driving Volvo XC-90s that will take to Pittsburgh's streets with a variety of physical upgrades and experiential differences, including the removal of the second technician in the front seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It might look very similar to the previous generation," Brian Zajac, director of hardware engineering at Uber's Advanced Technology Group, &lt;a href="http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/12756315-74/uber-unveils-second-generation-self-driving-car-in-pittsburgh" target="new"&gt;told the media&lt;/a&gt; at an unveiling event in Pittsburgh's Strip District on September 22. "But there's been a ton of improvements that we've made under the hood."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those physical improvements make the car capable of a higher level of performance than previously possible and, critically, make some changes that will enable these types of autonomous vehicles easier to mass produce, when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cameras mounted on the roofs of the Volvos are improved, now operating at a higher resolution for an improved range of detection. By being able to detect objects at a farther distance, the vehicle is able to go faster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set of sensors that sits on the cars' roofs, which includes Lidar, has seen a reduction in size and an economization of physical components, which makes producing the hardware easier and less expensive. Both cameras and other sensors have improved self-cleaning mechanisms, improving their performance in adverse weather conditions -- or even on the sunniest of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's really hard for the cameras to do their job when they are covered in bug splatter, so we can handle that now," Zajac noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pittsburgh, a significant part of the riding experience has been the iPads in the back of the car. To this point, the tablets have mostly been used for selfie-taking and sharing experiences through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the backseat iPads will provide footage of the car's surroundings that mimics how the vehicle's software perceives its environment. On the screen, objects that could affect a vehicle's actions- - traffic signs, other cars, pedestrians -- will be colored in orange, while objects that are "constants," like trees, will be colored in blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iPad operations in the front of the vehicle have been improved, as well. By consolidating various operations into a single tablet, Uber has enabled a single operator in the driver's seat to perform the tasks that used to require two people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber's tenure in Pittsburgh has not been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/technology/pittsburgh-ubers-driverless-car-experiment.html?mcubz=1" target="new"&gt;without controversy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, bumps in the road were to be expected, and both the company and city have learned a great deal about the challenges of putting new technology on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the unveiling of its new vehicles, Uber has, in a way, hit the refresh button. Round two of its self-driving operations in the Steel City will feature improvements, while also raising new questions and challenges. That's the point, after all.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The very nature of cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) creates a huge amount of potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, much of the focus right now is on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, where connected cars digitally exchange information with one another while on the road, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), where a central public network processes data from vehicles on the road to establish safe and efficient traffic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it sounds like these technologies will take significant investment to successfully establish, it's because they will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V2V will only become more viable as additional vehicles come equipped with the technology. And the building of V2I will, in some cases, require a fundamentally different approach to how cities organize their roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the prospective benefits of these systems in mind, automotive experts and city planners alike are in near universal agreement that those initial investments will pay off in spades. It's just a matter of taking the first steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those steps took place recently in San Diego. The city announced in late October that it has partnered with AT&amp;T, Ford, Nokia and Qualcomm Technologies to establish the very first V2X trials in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As wireless technology becomes prevalent, vehicles are using the cellular network for various tasks, ranging from emergency calls and over-the-air (OTA) updates, to diagnostics and real-time traffic updates," Qualcomm wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/10/31/att-ford-nokia-and-qualcomm-launch-cellular-v2x-connected-car-technology" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; unveiling the initiative. "Using direct communication mode, V2X is designed to help expand the role of wireless technology for road safety applications by facilitating the ability of vehicles to directly communicate with other vehicles, pedestrian devices, and roadside infrastructure, such as traffic signs and construction zones."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate sponsors aren't the only entities involved; there are a variety of organizations involved on the municipal side of the deal, as well. Participants  include the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), Caltrans (the California Department of Transportation), the City of Chula Vista and McCain, Inc., an intelligent transportation solutions firm. These civic bodies see a great number of immediate benefits for the public resulting from the coming V2X trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The knowledge and partnerships we gain from being a designated proving ground will help us advance innovation, enhance mobility, and improve our transportation systems," Mary Casillas Salas, mayor of Chula Vista, noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while this type of project indeed requires a large investment, the expenditure on the part of the city will be mitigated by contributions from the corporate partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The collaboration this partnership demonstrates between government agencies and the private sector significantly reduces deployment costs while accelerating the proliferation of the infrastructure necessary for the next generation of mobility technology," said SANDAG Chair and County Supervisor Ron Roberts. "Government will benefit from these new V2X roadside units integrated with cellular infrastructure, and San Diego is perfectly situated to provide a platform for new business models that can lead to safer roadways and more efficient operations."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are more than a few reasons why owning an electric car is desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where climate change is a constant concern, owning a vehicle that lowers one's carbon footprint feels like a moral imperative to some. With ten times fewer moving parts than a gas-powered car, EVs also typically require far less maintenance. And that's just one way that they can save owners money. Running a car on electricity is, simply put, less expensive than running a car on gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially true in times of energy insecurity, which impacts gas prices far more than electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why haven't electric cars fully caught on among consumers yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest reasons is the widespread belief that the current infrastructure in place for electric vehicle charging is insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fully charged car battery can only take a driver so far, and car owners need to know that they can find a charging station within a reasonable distance when they need to plug in their car. With the prevalence of gas stations, the prospect of a car running out of fuel is far less daunting than a car running out of battery power, when the nearest charging station could be 100-plus miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, public and private entities have commenced efforts to ease these concerns and establish a reliable and widespread infrastructure for charging EVs. Europe has been especially active. In November, a partnership or primarily German automakers announced a collaborative effort to install 400 "ultra-fast" vehicle charging stations across Europe by 2020, with the installations beginning this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ionity, a joint venture of BMW AG, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen with its Audi and Porsche brands, plans to open 20 stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria," Reuters &lt;a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-electricity-autos-charging/carmakers-plan-400-europe-car-charging-stations-by-2020-idUKKBN1D30YE" target="new"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. "They will be 120 km (75 miles) apart and run in partnership with Tank &amp; Rast, Circle K and OMV."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a product of high-profile partners, the power and influence behind Ionity cannot be overstated. (As &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ionity-is-european-for-big-ass-ev-charging-network/" target="new"&gt;CNET&lt;/a&gt; hilariously put it, "Ionity is European for 'big-ass' EV charging network.") BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen each hold equal shares in the company, although the possibility remains that more automakers could join the venture. The chargers they plan to offer are no joke. At 350 kW per charging point, the Ionity chargers will be three times as powerful as Tesla Superchargers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The launch of Ionity represents a breakthrough in the move towards a comprehensive rapid charging infrastructure in Europe," Oliver Blume, chairman of Porsche's executive board, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/company/porsche-ionity-europe-high-power-charging-network-joint-venture-electromobility-14439.html"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Creating a functioning charging infrastructure is necessary for ensuring electromobility is accepted and further expanded. With the rapid charging network from Ionity, we are ensuring that our customers can use electric cars on long journeys without compromising on convenience."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ionity launch comes amidst a spate of announcements of EV initiatives in Europe. Mitsubishi recently announced that it had joined with a series of partners to introduce V2G technology in the Netherlands, which will enable electric cars to return electricity to the grid for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With V2G-technology, we turn parked electric vehicles -- at home and at work -- into power service providers and energy buffers," &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737642" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Sytse Zuidema, CEO of NewMotion, one of Mitsubishi's partners in the initiative. "They can save a surplus of energy and return energy to the grid at a peak time. This results in more stability and security."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the EV space is one that is seeing a lot of action right now, especially in Europe. With businesses taking the lead, it will be interesting to see if consumers soon follow.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time since BlackBerry made the best-known smartphones on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days before touchscreens, music streaming, and FaceTime, BlackBerry devices became nearly ubiquitous among business professionals who used them to send emails or browse the web. The physical QWERTY keyboard of the BlackBerry was a major advancement over the chocolate bar or clamshell-shaped cell phones that had dominated up until that point. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone staring down at a BlackBerry device these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has since ceded the smartphone market to Apple and Samsung, but Blackberry, which now defines itself as "a mobile-native security software and services company dedicated to securing the enterprise of things" hasn't gone away. In fact, it may have found an even more lucrative field to enter: autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major part of &lt;a href="https://us.blackberry.com/" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt;'s current business is its QNX Software Systems, a network of various connectivity-enabling operating systems that the company acquired from Harman in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary applications for QNX systems is connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, according to a recent report by David George-Cosh for the Wall Street Journal, &lt;a href="http://www.jaguarlandrover.com/" target="new"&gt;Jaguar Land Rover&lt;/a&gt; is eyeing a deal with BlackBerry to use QNX to enable self-driving cars, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A potential deal between the two companies would give JLR access to the Canadian company's QNX software suite, which would be used to securely handle the computing power needed to run driverless vehicles," George-Cosh &lt;a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/11/03/blackberry-in-talks-with-tata-motors-jaguar-land-rover-for-software-deal-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. "BlackBerry's QNX software is used to securely manage and handle the millions of lines of code that autonomous cars rely upon to analyze a complex system of sensors to avoid hitting other vehicles, read traffic signals, and assess road conditions. The company doesn't write the code used by driverless cars but mainly acts as an operating system that connects various components, much like how applications run on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an arrangement with Jaguar Land Rover would be the second such deal for BlackBerry, which has had a deal with Ford since 2014, when the automaker decided to use QNX to power its Sync 3 infotainment system. The two companies expanded the scope of their agreement last October to encompass all aspects of Ford's connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With the success of our Sync 3 system globally, which is based on the BlackBerry QNX operating system, we understand the importance of the connected car experience to our customers," Ford CTO Raj Nair &lt;a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/blackberry-signs-agreement-with-ford-motor-company-expanded-use-blackberrys-qnx-security-nasdaq-bbry-2171230.htm" target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; at the time. "Growing our expertise, experience and use of the BlackBerry QNX embedded software platforms will help ensure we deliver the high-quality, highly secure experience that our customers expect."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's uncertain how exactly Blackberry's QNX could be deployed to assist in vehicular autonomy with Jaguar Land Rover. But if the deal gets done it would be another sign that Blackberry is emerging as a power in the autonomous vehicle space, which is all the more impressive considering the scope and size of the pivot the company needed to undertake in order to reach this point.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In discussions about autonomous vehicles, the focus is often on the car itself. Picking the company that will be the first to have a fully autonomous Level 5 car has become a bit of a parlor game in automotive and tech circles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while it may get less attention, there is an equally intriguing competition taking place to develop the platform that will be the underpinning of connected and self-driving cars going forward, regardless of who the manufacturer is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the leaders in this space is &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="new"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and it was announced in November that the tech giant had struck another deal to expand its international footprint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will collaborate with Indian ride-hailing company &lt;a href="https://www.olacabs.com/" target="new"&gt;Ola&lt;/a&gt; to power its connected car platform, known as Ola Play. Microsoft's Azure cloud service platform will enable deeper and better connectivity for all of Ola Play's functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Globally, the auto industry is experiencing a seismic shift as the definition of automobiles is increasingly changing from gas-powered vehicles to technology-packed, connected devices," said Bhavish Aggarwal, co-founder and CEO of Ola wrote in a &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-in/ola-partners-microsoft-build-new-connected-vehicle-platform-future/" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "With Ola Play, we have already set the tone for connected vehicles in India; together with Microsoft, we can make the new platform available to a larger, global audience and unlock futuristic experiences for customers worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who live in North America may be unfamiliar with Ola, but the company is an automotive force in India, where it is competing with Uber for ride-hailing supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, the company &lt;a href="https://www.olacabs.com/media/press/ola-raises-1-1-billion-in-its-latest-round-of-funding" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a $1.1 billion round of funding led by Tencent Holdings Limited. In the same announcement, Ola noted it would also close an additional $1 billion of funding, bringing the total of the round to over $2 billion. As &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/ola-raises-1-1b-from-tencent-and-softbank/" target="new"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; reported, the funding could bring Ola's total valuation to as much as $7 billion once the deals are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, the partnership with Ola continues a series of large deals the company has struck in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July, Microsoft and &lt;a href="http://baidu.us/" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese tech giant, &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2017/07/18/baidu-and-microsoft-join-forces-in-the-intelligent-cloud-to-advance-autonomous-driving/" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Azure would be incorporated into Apollo, Baidu's self-driving platform, in order to help Baidu's offering scale globally.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;While strides have been made toward transitioning to electric vehicles in the consumer automobile category, change has been slower to come to the fleet trucking industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 95% of heavy-duty trucks on the road run on diesel fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the image of lurching, 40-ton metal beasts spewing black exhaust from their tailpipes may be outdated, it doesn't change the fact that diesel is still a fossil fuel. Electric vehicles represent a much cleaner alternative. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/25/electric-cars-emit-50-less-greenhouse-gas-than-diesel-study-finds" target="new"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by VUB University in Belgium, an electric vehicle will emit about half the CO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; emissions of a diesel vehicle over its lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is not surprising that the best known electric vehicle company is turning its attention to trucks. &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;'s newest vehicle isn't a sedan or a SUV -- it's a semi. On November 16, Tesla CEO announced that the company would begin manufacturing Semi in 2019. The truck will maintain a charge for 500 miles at highway speeds bearing maximum weight, and will accelerate to 60mph with 80,000 pounds in 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Looking like something Batman might have designed, the Tesla Semi prototype ... is heavy on aerodynamic fairings that are said to, along with its electric engine, drive the cost-per-mile below that of today's gas-powered machines," USA Today's Marco della Cava &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/11/16/tesla-semi-electric-big-rig-truck-rolls-into-reality/873162001/" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

{image 1}

&lt;p&gt;Accompanying the announcement of the Semi was the important revelation that Tesla will build a system of Megacharger stations -- different than the Supercharger station that service their passenger cars -- for the trucks to juice up. The stations will be placed every 400 miles, a number built to accommodate the vehicles' battery power and the amount of time a human driver can drive before they ought to stop for rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The reason 400 miles is important is you have to take a break eventually," Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/38529-tesla-semi-truck-elon-musk" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the unveiling. "If you drive for five or six hours, that's about as much as you want to be driving continuously."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Semi's cockpit will feature dual touchscreens for drivers to keep track of vehicle diagnostics and utilize advanced driver assistance systems. More revolutionary, though, is Tesla's placement of the driver's seat at the center of the truck, as opposed to the left side. Passenger seats will be placed behind the driver's seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You're positioned like you're in a race car," Musk said. "You have complete visibility of the road and all your surroundings ... I can drive this thing and I have no idea how to drive a semi."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla did not reveal how much the new truck would cost. With its leading edge electric drive train and impressive performance specs, the Semi certainly won't be cheap. But fleet companies are already signing on. &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171117005116/en/J.B.-Hunt-Transport-Services-Reserves-Tesla-Trucks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;J.B. Hunt Transport Services&lt;/a&gt; announced it would buy multiple vehicles for use on the west coast of the US and Walmart said it planned to order 15 Tesla Semis, five to be used in the US and ten for Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the upfront costs are set to be higher, Tesla estimates that the fuel savings could top $200,000 compared with diesel semis. Savings like that will certainly make fleet operators take notice.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;"Massive" doesn't even begin to describe the scope of the infrastructure upgrades that will be required to create a safe environment in which self-driving vehicles can operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a single highway sign vehicle-to-infrastructure-enabled could cost tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine how many of those signs you pass on your commute and you get a sense of the capital investment involved. But those investments need not be shouldered entirely by government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When inadequate access to charging stations became a hurdle for consumer adoption of electric vehicles, Tesla built a network of Supercharger stations that spanned far and wide, including places without a high density of Tesla ownership. The investment was worth it in the long run for Tesla because it shifted public attitudes about the feasibility of EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar steps from businesses will likely be required to move the needle for self-driving cars. The introduction of self-driving cars and shuttle buses on public roads is one step. But Taiwan-based manufacturing company &lt;a href="http://www.foxconn.com/" target="new"&gt;Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; is exploring taking things a step further as it builds a new factory in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple supplier is considering a public-private partnership with the state to establish dedicated autonomous vehicle lanes on Interstate 94.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story by Rick Romell for the &lt;a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2017/11/13/driverless-vehicle-lanes-94-being-studied-foxconn/860515001/" target="new"&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; describes how Foxconn and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are working through a range of ideas to help accommodate the &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/18/news/scott-walker-signs-foxconn-deal/index.html" target="new"&gt;$3 billion factory&lt;/a&gt; Foxconn is building in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foxconn claims it will hire as many as 13,000 workers for the new facility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factory will be approximately 20 miles from downtown Milwaukee, and the strain of thousands of workers making commutes to and from the factory would be too much for current highway infrastructure to bear. Among the solutions being discussed is a dedicated AV lane that would draw significant attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, given the current status of self-driving technology, this isn't an initiative that could be implemented immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're thinking about two years down the road; [Foxconn is] thinking 20 years down the road," said Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce president Tim Sheehy in describing how Foxconn proposed the AV lane idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highway AV lane could be seen as more of a publicity stunt than a serious proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Foxconn wants to be seen as innovative, there are more practical measures that can ease forthcoming traffic loads. But publicity stunts can also be extremely effective and need not be mutually exclusive from a substantive plan. Thinking today about how our roads can best be utilized tomorrow is the best way to make that future a reality.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are two primary schools of thought when it comes to safety and self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One perspective holds up the belief that driverless cars will significantly reduce automotive fatalities -- by as much as 90%, according to one commonly cited statistic. To reach that point faster, we should accelerate the rate of introduction of AVs onto our roads now so that it will take less time for them to be perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposing viewpoint is that it is unethical to rush self-driving cars onto public roads before they're fully developed. The obvious reason is that it could put people's lives in danger. But a secondary explanation is that if imperfect driverless cars are introduced too early, it could damage the reputation of driverless cars down the road, thus limiting their future potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, no one thinks that an underdeveloped driverless car should be recklessly testing in actual public traffic, but the debate about release timelines continues to dominate the world of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech at the Detroit Auto Show on earlier this month, US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao straddled the line between enthusiasm for the development of autonomous vehicles and caution in their development. She also announced a new set of AV guidelines, which she referred to as AV 3.0, that will be released in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines, Chao said, won't focus exclusively on driverless cars -- they'll address all forms of vehicular autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"AV 3.0 will include guidance for more than just automobiles," Chao &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/detroit-auto-show" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. "It will address barriers to the safe integration of autonomous technology for motor carriers, transit, trucks, infrastructure and other modes, as well. The Department will update this guidance as often as needed. That's part of our commitment to streamline the process and to keep pace with innovation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only in September, when the DOT released its last iteration of these guidelines, called "&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736369" target="new"&gt;A Vision for Safety 2.0&lt;/a&gt;." Those followed the inaugural guidelines that were released a year earlier. In her remarks, Chao said that this frequent updating was a reflection of the fast-moving development of technology in the AV space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chao also addressed the frequently discussed issue surrounding the impact self-driving cars could have on professional drivers and their job security. Some analysts believe that tens of thousands of people could lose their jobs. In Detroit, Chao lauded the Auto Show for partnering with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to host the first-ever Future Automotive Career Exposition at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Chao aligned the DOT with the belief that eliminating barriers to AV deployment is the greatest means of promoting automotive safety at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the US Department of Transportation, safety will always be our number one priority," she said. "That's why a key part of DOT's mission is to cultivate and encourage innovation in safety by eliminating unnecessary obstacles to the development and integration of new technology."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Because there are so many more components to an autonomous vehicle, there are, accordingly, a lot more things that need to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most self-driving cars use a combination of Lidar-, radar- and camera-based sensors that each need to be tested individually and as a collective group. It isn't enough to see how they perform in idealized conditions. These tests need to take place in a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739278" target="new"&gt;variety of weather and lighting conditions&lt;/a&gt;, because sensors can behave differently in inclement weather like snow and at nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to improving the sensors themselves, there are also efforts underway to develop the objects that they are sensing. Automotive paint company &lt;a href="http://corporate.ppg.com/Home.aspx" target="new"&gt;PPG&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that it had partnered with &lt;a href="https://mcity.umich.edu/our-work/mcity-test-facility/" target="new"&gt;MCity&lt;/a&gt;, the public-private autonomous vehicle test facility at the University of Michigan, to develop and test paints and coatings designed specifically for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Specialized coatings will play an integral role in the development of safe and reliable driverless vehicles," Gary Danowski, PPG vice president of automotive OEM coatings, wrote in a &lt;a href="http://newsroom.ppg.com/getmedia/08cfb1cf-def2-4244-8b06-53ac14b0d378/PPG-NAIAS-McityPartnership-011518-vFINAL.pdf.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We are enthusiastic about this partnership and are always actively seeking additional R&amp;D partners as we continue to explore new possibilities in emerging vehicle technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the projects that PPG will work on at MCity is the creation of a specialized car paint that can be detected more easily by autonomous car sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glare from the sun that bounces off traditional car paints can confuse a driverless car's systems. This may have played a role in the &lt;a href="http://abc7news.com/automotive/tesla-self-driving-car-fails-to-detect-truck-in-fatal-crash/1410042/" target="new"&gt;2016 crash&lt;/a&gt; involving a driver using Tesla's Autopilot feature, which is the first-known fatal accident involving semiautonomous driving technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another potential project involves the sensors themselves. PPG suggested it will try to develop easy-to-clean coatings that would protect an autonomous vehicle's sensor hardware. As anyone who has ever waited too long to wash their car can attest, automobiles get dirty fast. Lidar sensors are no exception, but specialized coatings could mitigate the effect dirt or debris would have on their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opened in 2015, MCity is the "world's first purpose-build facility" for testing driverless and connected cars, and their accompanying technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's home to a wide variety of AV projects, including an on-campus &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734742" target="new"&gt;driverless shuttle&lt;/a&gt; for the University of Michigan's engineering students and faculty that was designed by the French company Navya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Autonomous vehicle technology offers numerous real-world advantages, and the ability to test such technologies safely and thoroughly is essential for proving the viability of advanced mobility solutions," MCity director Huei Peng noted in the statement. "Our state-of-the-art facility offers a controlled environment for manufacturers like PPG to develop and hone the capabilities of autonomous vehicles and related technologies, while also providing them access to a variety of valuable tools and resources. We're excited to have PPG be part of this journey."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Alphabet's self-driving car project, Waymo, and General Motors, the twin titans of autonomous vehicles, were the top-performing companies for vehicle testing, according to reports that the automakers submitted to California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As part of its regulations, California requires companies testing its self-driving vehicles on public roads to submit a &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/disengagement_report_2017"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on the year's test results, including disengagements, or incidents when a human operator had to manually take over the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo was way out in front, a leading position the company -- formerly known as the Google self-driving car project -- has held for numerous years, with just 62 disengagements reported for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the company doubled its number of autonomous miles, racking up nearly 2 million miles over a 12-month period, with Waymo's autonomous vehicles having self-driven &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738733"target="new"&gt; more than 4 million miles&lt;/a&gt; across 25 US cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/42aff875-7ab1-4115-a72a-97f6f24b23cc/Waymofull.pdf?MOD=AJPERES"target="new"&gt;reporting period&lt;/a&gt; for California ending in November, the Waymo fleet travelled 352,545 autonomous miles in the state on public roads, navigating city streets, local neighborhoods and freeways, and saw the disengagement rate fall from 0.20 to 0.18 per thousand miles travelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the California report is one indicator of Waymo's continued success, it should be pointed out that the state DMV report is only a small look into the company's ambitious program, which has shifted its center to Phoenix for the planned launch of its commercial ride-hailing service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM saw its vehicles drive a total of 131,676 miles in 2017, representing a 121,900-mile increase from 2016, and the company is currently seeking US government approval for a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvP82IsGqNc"target="new"&gt;fully autonomous car&lt;/a&gt;, without a steering wheel or brake and accelerator pedals, to enter the company's first commercial ride-sharing fleet next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert Boniske, director of product integrity for Cruise (GM's self driving car division), wrote in a December report to the California DMV that Cruise self-driving vehicles, which are based on the Chevrolet Bolt platform, were used for all testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boniske noted all the driving was done on San Francisco's complex city streets, with 105 reported disengagements during the 12-month period -- with a little under half of those disengagements undertaken due to other road users behaving poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Cities like San Francisco contain significantly more people, cars, and cyclists that our self-driving vehicles must be aware of at any given time," Boniske &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/d94d9334-9955-4f97-aae1-5a2c9f10673b/GM_Cruise.pdf?MOD=AJPERES"target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;. "That makes San Francisco one of the hardest places to test a self-driving vehicle, and creates a rich environment for testing our object detection, prediction, and response functions. It also helps us validate our vehicles' self-driving skills faster than testing in a suburban location alone."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo's testing is not just limited to real-world roads, however. In a Medium post touting its progress, Waymo revealed that last year the company drove an additional 2.7 billion miles in the virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At its peak, Waymo's simulators complete 2,000 complex driving scenarios each second," the post &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/the-worlds-longest-and-toughest-ongoing-driving-test-44464867865b"target="new"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, research firm Navigant released a &lt;a href="https://www.navigantresearch.com/research/navigant-research-leaderboard-automated-driving-vehicles"target="new"&gt;leaderboard&lt;/a&gt; evaluating 19 companies developing automated driving systems, and found GM in the lead, followed by Waymo, Daimler-Bosch and Ford, with Volkswagen rounding out the Top Five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk's Tesla finished dead last, despite the sophistication of the company's vehicles and the high-profile efforts Telsa has made to introduce Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler and Bosch, the world's largest auto parts supplier, told a German car publication that the two companies are partnering on a self-driving taxi that would begin testing themselves on city streets in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There will be test vehicles on the streets in the coming months," Bosch chief executive Volkmar Denner &lt;a href="ahttps://www.automobilwoche.de/article/20180203/BCONLINE/180209967/exklusiv--kooperation-mit-bosch-daimler-will-als-erster-konzern-robotaxis-anbieten"target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dennner didn't elaborate as to what cities or under what conditions the vehicles will be tested, but the company does possess experience in this field, having conducted self-driving truck tests in Nevada in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Apart from highly autonomous level 3 vehicles, we will also bring fully autonomous vehicles -- level 4/5 -- to the streets in the foreseeable future," Wilko Stark, vice president Daimler and Mercedes-Benz Cars strategy, told Automobilwoche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level 4 vehicles are "designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip" according to a US Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/AV/federal-automated-vehicles-policy-september-2016"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note, however, that Level 4 vehicle autonomous capabilities are limited to the "operational design domain (ODD)" of the vehicle -- meaning it does not cover every driving scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Level 5 vehicle is one that can match a human driver in every driving scenario, including extreme environments like dirt roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daimler's Stark also noted the partnership with Bosch was running smoothly and the company was planning to offer mobility services with their own robotaxis as soon as possible, noting platforms for these services such as Mytaxi, Via and Moovel already exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The big difference to other competitors is that we are conceptualizing our vehicle as a robotaxi right from the beginning and not as a technology-kit mounted on a production vehicle," Stark explained. "We are not building a makeshift solution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daimler, the world's largest luxury automaker, will have to keep the pressure up if it wants to stay in competition with the likes of rivals like BMW, which has promised to deliver at Level 5 self-driving vehicle to market by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elmar Frickenstein, the Bavarian companys senior vice president for autonomous driving, was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bmw-autonomous-self-driving/bmw-says-self-driving-car-to-be-level-5-capable-by-2021-idUSKBN16N1Y2"target="new"&gt;reported as saying&lt;/a&gt; during a panel discussion in Berlin in March 2017 that the company was in fact working on Level 3, 4 and 5 types of vehicles to be ready for 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year before the public announcement, BMW had teamed up with Intel and Mobileye, an Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving specialist, to develop an open platform for the next generation of cars, from door locks to data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740141"target="new"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; thousands of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to expand its ever-growing autonomous vehicle fleet, and are due to arrive later this year when the company expands its autonomous ride-sharing service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan's automakers are under &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/japan-aims-to-show-off-autonomous-vehicles-at-2020-summerolympics/article36971226/"target="new"&gt;even greater&lt;/a&gt; pressure, with the government pushing for a 2020 Summer Olympics deadline to wow an international crowd of sports fans with a fleet of autonomous vehicles shuttling athletes, organizers and VIPs around Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For many industries and markets in 2017, the key to achieving a stronger customer base is incorporating connectivity into product offerings. Customers want to invest in relationships that will bring them the benefits of efficiency and convenience -- and the automotive industry is starting to respond to this growing demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to refining and advancing in-vehicle technologies, connected car makers are looking beyond the driver experience from within the car, and are developing new capabilities that enable data to connect and interact with third parties outside the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before these capabilities can be successfully implemented, automotive manufacturers need to provide supportive infrastructure: real-time, cloud-based, secure, connected services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Leveraging cloud services will substantially increase the number of use cases that connected vehicles can support, as cloud platforms will not only work within the car but will connect to a wide range of outside data sources. Services will become advanced and personalized, including smart transport solutions and monitoring capabilities that memorize your driving style and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Drivers and passengers of connected vehicles will also have access to several value-added services, such as shopping and media content streaming, directly from the vehicle. 

&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: You rent a car at the airport and when you pick it up, your unique driver profile is instantly downloaded so the vehicle is set up according to your specific preferences. Your music and podcast playlists from your smartphone are readily available and synced to the sound system. When you input your destination, the navigation system analyzes real-time traffic light data to factor in the frequency of when the lights will turn yellow or red, optimizing the fastest route possible and minimizing time wasted in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With highly sophisticated and personalized connectivity capabilities comes new security challenges that should be addressed preemptively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of solely protecting the hardware that lives inside the vehicle, there is a growing need for security to cover the entire ecosystem from the vehicle to the cloud and any third-party providing data feeds. Implementing identity management in a vehicle can enable it to understand who and what it can exchange data with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the car will know that it can talk to a given cloud server and which APIs can be interacted with and what data they can share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The vehicle will also understand other key elements such as the normal pattern of behavior, including the time of day and frequency of interactions, as well as the type of data exchanged. It will also be able to detect abnormal behavioral patterns. This comprehensive set of capabilities creates a trust, verify-based approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as the market for automotive services continues to expand, identity management will be important for enabling new, consumer orientated, and vehicle-to-"thing" relationships to develop.  For instance, in a trust-based relationship between the connected car and the smart home, your car would be able to send instructions to your home to turn off lights, activate your alarm system, turn on your air conditioner, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship would function both ways, allowing your home to send alerts to your car. Your smart refrigerator would be able to check your food inventory and let you know if you needed to pick up milk on your drive home.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;The best time to add identity management to vehicles is at the point of manufacture on the production line, as the manufacturer will be able to fully verify the installation. This will also allow vehicles to be pre-configured for secure relations with OEMs and cloud services, and can be fully integrated with other security mechanisms within the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;You don't have to have a deep knowledge of autonomous vehicle component price points -- or even much of a knowledge of cars at all -- to correctly guess that self-driving cars will be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; expensive when they first go to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's one of the largest hurdles on the path to getting a large number of AVs on the road. The technology may be ready relatively soon, but its cost could delay it becoming readily accessible to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial enterprises share the concern as well. While autonomous capabilities figure to eventually help the bottom line for trucking companies, upfront investments in self-driving trucks figure to be enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian startup &lt;a href="http://fluxauto.xyz/" target="new"&gt;Flux Auto&lt;/a&gt; is well aware of that problem, and it's going outside the box in its approach to fixing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company wants to lower the cost of acquiring a self-driving truck not by manufacturing its own at a cheaper cost, but by devising a kit that could be retrofitted to pre-existing trucks to give them autonomous driving capabilities. To keep costs down, Flux Auto made the bold decision to not include Lidar sensors in its designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While the competition is focusing on Lidar technology which is very expensive and processing heavy (due to a lot of unneeded data), our vision algorithms can be used with any cheap cameras and has a much quicker response time," founder Pranav Manpuria &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/flux-auto/" target="_blank"&gt;told TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "This drives down our cost and in turn, the cost for the customer as well, all while having similar levels of accuracy as a Lidar system."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;the high cost of Lidar&lt;/a&gt; has been a frequent topic of discussion in the world of self-driving vehicles, developing an alternative solution for a baseline AV technology would seem like a sensible way of lowering prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, easier said than done, and Mapuria's assertion that a car could operate autonomously "with any cheap cameras" is one that will need to be seen to be believed. Currently, Lidar represents the core piece of AV development for nearly every major player in the space except for Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734825" target="new"&gt;as well as some ex-Tesla engineers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto Flux joins a bevy of competitors in the autonomous trucking space, a sector that many believe will have a major presence on public roads long before consumer vehicles do. Companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734426" target="new"&gt;Einride&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden, New York startup &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734648" target="new"&gt;Transfix&lt;/a&gt; and Peterbilt partner &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734748" target="new"&gt;Embark&lt;/a&gt; have all put unique spins on their approaches to autonomous trucking, although none quite as radical as Auto Flux's retrofitting method. Due to the prospective job loss that would come from the proliferation of autonomous trucking, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=735050" target="new"&gt;there has been pushback from American unions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, though, where Auto Flux is based, there has been talk of not allowing self-driving cars on roads at all. "We won't allow any technology that takes away jobs," Indian union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734963" target="new"&gt;said in July&lt;/a&gt;. "In a country where you have unemployment, you can't have a technology that ends up taking people's jobs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gadkari's proclamation is yet to be followed by any formal legislation, and it's unclear if it ever will. Perhaps some success in the AV industry by a domestic company like Auto Flux would convince lawmakers that encouraging the development of such technology within its borders would be in the best economic interest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of any new technology needs to be done thoughtfully and deliberately. If not, the consequences, both intended and unintended, can be dire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For self-driving cars, the consequences revolve mostly around safety. No one wants autonomous vehicles on public streets until they're fully ready to be there.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;There are also, however, issues of public perception. When autonomous vehicles reach the point where they can safely travel on public roads in large numbers, they won't actually be able to do so unless people are willing to ride in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why having a firm understanding of just how many people currently have faith in self-driving cars is so important. Not only does it tell you about consumers' current state of mind, it also can help clarify the amount and type of education, messaging and marketing required to move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://trl.co.uk/sites/default/files/Attitudes%20to%20AV%20TRL%20Report_final_PPR823.pdf" target="new"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Royal Holloway at the University of London's Economic &amp; Social Research Council and &lt;a href="https://trl.co.uk/" target="new"&gt;TRL&lt;/a&gt;, a research and consulting group, looked at consumer attitudes towards autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey's primary focus was on the UK, with over 60% of respondents surveyed in person in London and the rest answering questions online. The major takeaway from the survey results came from a single, overarching statement: "Driverless cars are a good idea." Of the respondents who answered, 81% replied that they agreed or strongly agreed, while a minuscule 1% replied that they disagreed or strongly disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For autonomous vehicles engineers anxious about how their products will be received, this is incredibly encouraging news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, of the survey's 233 participants, 148 were recruited through TRL's &lt;a href="https://trl.co.uk/projects/gateway-automated-vehicle-research" target="new"&gt;GATEway&lt;/a&gt; program for having expressed an interest in self-driving cars. A loose equivalent would be gathering a group of people who had expressed an interest in ice cream, and then asking them if they would like to eat some ice cream. Further, over 70% of respondents were male, and the survey itself notes that, in other studies, men have had more positive responses to self-driving cars than women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, though, that both Internet (non-recruited) respondents and women also had overwhelmingly positive responses to the idea of self-driving cars in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest are the thoughts gathered from a freeform response section at the end of the survey, in which participants riffed on whatever came to mind about autonomous vehicles. The study published every single one of these responses verbatim, lending great insight into how potential consumers of self-driving cars view the technology in their own words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One discussed the ethical implications of forcing self-driving cars to choose between two devastating outcomes. "I think the discussion on potential accidents -- a car choosing to hit elderly vs. younger people in case an accident cannot be avoided -- will be very interesting." It's a dilemma that various scientists and ethicists have &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734430" target="new"&gt; worked on extensively&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another comment was aggressive in its advocacy for self-driving cars because of their safety potential. "The 'I like to drive' argument is frankly worthy of contempt and should be immediately countered by facts about the harm human drivers cause."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tough to draw any broad conclusions from isolated examples such as these. But they do show that John Q. Public is concerned with many of the same issues that those in the autonomous vehicle industry are working hard to overcome. As developers and engineers make progress in these areas, public confidence is sure to rise even higher.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For those looking to convince people of the dangers of new technology, referencing works of science fiction is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, the short stories of Isaac Asimov show the thin line between robots helping people and robots hurting people. To make someone scared of space travel, watching &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; will probably do the trick. And if you wanted to show the dangers of time travel, there's &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Chicago City Council, Alderman Edward Burke recently used &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; to prove a point about a futuristic technology, but it wasn't about time travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead Burke used the Marty McFly movie as a cautionary tale &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chicago-driverless-cars-regulations-met-20170821-story.html" target="new"&gt;about self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;. On August 23, Burke and Alderman Anthony Beale proposed an ordinance under which companies testing self-driving cars in Chicago would need to pay a $500 permit for each car, and only employees or contractors of those companies would be able to operate these vehicles. The proposal was not voted on, as aldermen would like to gather more information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burke expressed concern with potential AV issues like fleet-wide hacks, while Beale said that self-driving cars could take "hundreds of thousands of jobs" from Chicago residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Malicious trickery, vandalism and the more deadly threat of driverless cars falling into the hands of terrorists that could crash it into a crowded urban center, a building, an outdoor market or a festival, raises serious concerns," Burke said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, many share Burke's concerns with safety and are already addressing them. Automakers and other automobile tech developers are &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735086" target="new"&gt;hiring cybersecurity experts&lt;/a&gt; at a rapid pace to ensure that all connected cars, not just autonomous ones, are safe from hackers. The US Senate is currently working on &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735183" target="new"&gt;an Internet of Things security bill&lt;/a&gt; that will create standards for connected car manufacturers and other IoT companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic problem raised by Beale, however, appears to have fewer proposed solutions. &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735050" target="new"&gt;Various labor unions&lt;/a&gt; are hoping to slow down self-driving car development until more thought has been put into the issue. But the most likely solution will be the development of new jobs instead of the preservation of outmoded ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aldermen's proposed ordinance comes on the heels of one that would have banned self-driving cars in Chicago altogether, a measure that was rejected due to &lt;a href="http://chicagoist.com/2017/03/31/is_the_self-driving_revolution_head.php" target="new"&gt;state legislation&lt;/a&gt; that encourages testing AVs on Illinois roads. On the national level, too, one finds that legislators are far more interested in loosening AV regulations than tightening them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives have thus far been enthusiastic about a bill that will &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734769" target="new"&gt;limit states' powers&lt;/a&gt; to strictly regulate AV testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this climate that is so intent on technological progress, it's not surprising that the proposed ordinance in Chicago is so toothless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the most enthusiastic proponents of public testing of self-driving cars would likely see little wrong with what is effectively a small tax on the vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the city could be missing out on an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urban testing of AVs is especially valuable due to the complexity of the environments, and if Chicago doesn't step up to welcome the technology, other cities certainly will. Those cities will likely have an easier time attracting businesses that work in the AV space, and the jobs and tax revenue that come along with those businesses.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The possibility of autonomous vehicles -- and in particular, autonomous trucks -- leading to job losses in various sectors of the economy has been at the forefront of discussions about the holistic viability of the technology for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As futuristic as self-driving cars seem, the fundamental concerns they raise have been around for even longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machines replacing human workers was a central concern of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. Ultimately, the Industrial Revolution created far more jobs than it eliminated, and grew the global economy by several orders of magnitude. The challenge now is to figure out how to do the same with  the autonomous vehicle revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As CEO of consulting firm Deloitte, which has emerged as a leader in studying the &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-study-future-of-autonomous-vehicles-in-minds-of-consumers.html" target="new"&gt;future of mobility&lt;/a&gt;, Cathy Engelbert has a unique perspective when it comes to analyzing where the automotive industry is headed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some in her position have been hesitant to speak about potential job loss resulting from widespread use of driverless vehicles, Engelbert addressed the issue head-on &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1041603/driverless-cars-and-trucks-dont-mean-mass-unemployment-they-mean-new-kinds-of-jobs/" target="new"&gt;in a Quartz post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Putting our heads in the sand won't stop the inexorable advancement of technology," she writes. "So, an approach grounded in facts rather than sensationalism is critical. Neither Pollyanna nor Chicken Little will likely have an accurate picture."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging that ride-hailing services have expanded driving as a job opportunity for workers in recent years, Engelbert writes that another, newer emerging trend -- ride-&lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; -- will reverse that growth sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many forecasts estimate that shared autonomous vehicle fleets will begin being introduced in 2020 and start materially cannibalizing the driver-driven segment by the middle of the decade," writes Engelbert. "That leaves a big question: What future jobs can these people take on, and what training and skills will they need?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her answer relies upon the belief that autonomous vehicle technology will make transportation and shipping far less expensive and far more efficient for the parties providing those services. That means both increased revenues for those companies and cheaper costs for customers, meaning more expendable income for everyone involved. Travel and leisure sectors of the economy will see continued growth, opening up new job opportunities that would theoretically be available to those displaced by autonomous tech, according to Engelbert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also sees the potential for entirely new types of jobs in the automobile industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That could mean everything from maintaining vehicle fleets to remote monitoring," she writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engelbert also points out that, as presently constituted, the trucking industry is far from saturated with drivers. In fact, it needs the exact type of additional help that driverless trucks could provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The trucking industry faces a seemingly-chronic shortage of commercially licensed drivers, and the major industry group estimates that nearly 900,000 new drivers will be needed in the US over the next decade," she writes. "The industry also faces high turnover and low interest from younger workers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of a shift to autonomous trucking, Engelbert expects that those who do keep their jobs as truckers -- whether as drivers or monitors of self-driving trucks -- will see an increase in quality of life. They'll no longer need to drive such long distances, meaning less grueling work and more time spent with family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming years, changes in trucking and other automotive sectors will reveal the degree to which Engelbert's theories are accurate. But focusing too heavily on her prophesy skills misses the point. What's important here is that Engelbert is discussing these issues in a frank, unflinching manner. More in the automotive industry need to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As the lobby for car dealerships nationwide, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) bears the responsibility of advocating for the best interest of its members. Naturally, this spirit pervades all of its media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href="http://www.nada.com/b2b/NADAOutlook/UsedCarTruckBlog/tabid/96/entryid/1108/what-is-ota.aspx" target="new"&gt;a recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;, for example, in which &lt;a href="http://www.nada.com/b2b/homepage.aspx" target="new"&gt;NADA&lt;/a&gt; recapped a J.D. Power consumer survey about over-the-air software updates in connected cars. As J.D. Power's &lt;a href="http://www.jdpower.com/resource/mobility-disruptors-are-customers-over-moon-tesla-software-updates" target="new"&gt;own recap&lt;/a&gt; of its survey states, more than half of consumers said they would want to receive OTA updates in their cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NADA's summary, however, focused on the more negative reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These new-era technologies are well received by participants, but they aren't perfect," reads NADA's blog post. "Some respondents reported problems that created frustration, like the modification of their previously programmed user settings. Others complained they disliked the current software update, and are not able to return to the earlier version which had become familiar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NADA's characterization isn't inaccurate, but it does feel a bit slanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what beef does NADA -- and the dealerships it represents -- have with OTA updates? Once they're fully operational, many believe OTA updates for connected cars could put a significant dent in one of dealerships' primary revenue streams: repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dealerships generate the greatest share of their profits from providing parts and repair services," reads a 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/160224_US_AutoDisruption.pdf"target="new"&gt;BBVA Research&lt;/a&gt; report. "If manufacturers can provide upgrades and check-ups remotely, then the adoption of OTA software could put the profitability of dealerships at risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, dealerships are not really threatened. For one thing, certain physical fixes must be done in person -- brake repairs will never be done over-the-air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(They could, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734561" target="new"&gt;be done by robots&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Equally important, but perhaps more short-lived, is a regulatory landscape that hamstrings OEMs from providing OTA updates to consumer vehicles without someone compensating dealerships. It's a hard-earned status quo for NADA, but one that seems unlikely to last given the rapidly accelerating capabilities of over-the-air technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170725/OEM06/170729843/barra-ota-2020" target="new"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; has announced plans to launch over-the-air updates before 2020 for their infotainment and mechanical software systems. &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170519/MOBILITY/170519720/ford-using-first-over-the-air-software-updates-for-2016-models" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; has found a way to offer limited OTA updates to its interactive Sync 3 system in 2016 models. &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170123/OEM06/301239828/vw-to-test-over-the-air-options" target="new"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; is experimenting with different models for the way it provides OTA offerings in hopes of drumming up greater customer interest. Always the outlier, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/02/teslas-air-fix-best-example-yet-internet-things/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; is entirely uninhibited in its distribution of OTA updates because it owns all of its dealerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/07/gm-to-offer-ota-software-updates-before-2020-but-only-for-a-new-infotainment-platform/?comments=1" target="new"&gt;recent column&lt;/a&gt; for Ars Technica, Jonathan M. Gitlin argued that dealerships' resistance to expanded OTA freedoms for OEMs could put drivers in danger down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We all know just how frequently security flaws are discovered (and then exploited) in embedded devices and the Internet of Things; it's almost unthinkable that any roadblocks should stand in the way of patching those flaws as quickly and safely as possible," Gitlin wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commenter on the article offered a counterpoint. "Mark my words, someday there will be a mass hack on OTA updatable vehicles and it's going to be unpleasant at best," wrote Ars Technica user Coppercloud. "I want updates, but please require physical access for that stuff." This argument is one that has been put forth by dealerships, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooner or later, advanced OTA technology and consumer interest will combine to make a loosening of these restrictions an inevitability. The question is, how will dealerships adapt and evolve in the aftermath of those changes?&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Ever since a few tense moments early in the 19th century, relations between Canada and the US have been consistently excellent. Gallup polls consistently reveal Canada to be Americans' favorite non-American nation by a significant margin. Memorable moments in the history of the countries' relationship include the signing of Canada-US Free Trade Agreement in 1988 and the time Ivanka Trump and Justin Trudeau attended a Broadway show together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest chapter in this storied friendship between nations came late in July, when the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Ontario Ministry of Transportation co-sponsored two self-driving cars that voyaged across 300 miles of roads in the US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the two cars -- a Cadillac ATS and a Chrysler 300 -- reached their destination in Traverse City, Mich. leaders of the MDOT and OMT signed a symbolic agreement to "promote and foster growth of connected and autonomous technology testing and deployment" between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Today's demonstration is an important example of how our ongoing cross-border cooperation is advancing connected and autonomous vehicle technologies," &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170731/OEM01/170739910/continental-magna-flaunt-their-autonomous-stuff" target="new"&gt;said Navdeep Bains&lt;/a&gt;, the Canadian minister of innovation, science and economic development, according to Automotive News. "Our government is committed to creating new good middle-class jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. By continuing to work with the United States, we will equip our citizens with the skills they need to design and build the cars of the future on both sides of the border."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.magna.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Magna International&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.continental-corporation.com/en" target="new"&gt;Continental&lt;/a&gt; collaborated to provide the autonomous technology for the two cars. The vehicles featured &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/autonomous-driving-levels-0-to-5-understanding-the-differences/" target="new"&gt;Level 3 autonomy&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that a driver was still necessary, but meaning his or her actual intervention would only be needed infrequently and under certain conditions. The vehicles made their trek largely unassisted, although they were conducted by drivers for the actual border crossing. Engineers at Magna and Continental will now be able to analyze how the car perceived its surroundings at the border crossing, helping them improve how their self-driving cars react to rare driving situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With our commitment to innovation and ongoing work in helping define the future mobility landscape, our involvement is a natural fit and we are pleased to join with our partners in this hands-free road trip," said Tom Toma, global product manager at Magna Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michigan and Ontario made natural partners for a show of international solidarity in the development of autonomous vehicles. This past December, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed a bill making his state one of the most permissive in the nation with regards to the testing of self-driving cars on public roads. As the center of the US auto industry in the 20th century, Michigan is angling to make AV technology a key component of its 21st-century economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm excited to sign this bill," &lt;a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2016/12/09/autonomous-car-law/95199544/" target="new"&gt;Snyder told Detroit News at the time&lt;/a&gt;. "In my heart I view this as a portal opening for safety, for opportunity for more economic success. We should be proud we're leading the world, right here in Michigan."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than two weeks prior to Snyder's remarks, Ontario became the first Canadian province to launch a pilot project for self-driving cars on public streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Frankly, there's excitement in every corner of the province about the fact that we are not only embracing this technology, but in the Canadian context we're leading on it," &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/11/28/self-driving-cars-ontario-canada_n_13287038.html" target="new"&gt;said Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca&lt;/a&gt;. "I think that the possibilities are limitless at this point."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There's an entire Internet economy built around speculating what products Apple has in the works. Will the new iPhone have a curved screen? Will it replace passcodes or thumbprint reading with facial recognition software as security technology? Will Siri cook dinner for you if you ask nicely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inquiring minds want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years now, one of the biggest questions surrounding Apple's plans has been whether the company is pursuing development of a self-driving car. The company set something of a high bar for itself with world-changing computers, MP3 players and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many feel that introducing an autonomous vehicle would be one of the few ways Apple could top itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, Apple has finally clued us in on some of its intentions with regards to self-driving cars. Even though it acknowledged some of its desires, Apple CEO Tim Cook remained characteristically cagey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're focusing on autonomous systems. And, clearly, one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars," Cook &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/cook-says-apple-is-focusing-on-making-an-autonomous-car-system" target="new"&gt;told Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; in a June interview. "There are others. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects, actually, to work on. And so autonomy is something that's incredibly exciting for us, but we'll see where it takes us. We're not really saying from a product point of view, but we are being straightforward in saying that it's a core technology that we see as important."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headlines declared it as confirmation that Apple was working on self-driving cars, which, explicitly, it was not. But given how opaque Cook and his teams can be with their plans for designing new products, his words were treated like a valuable nugget of insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early August, in a phone call with investors, Cook made more news by speaking on the subject again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[Autonomous] systems can be used in a variety of ways," &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/1/16079902/apple-autonomous-systems-going-beyond-cars" target="new"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. "A vehicle is only one, but there are many different areas of it. And I don't want to go any further with that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, not a lot to go off of, but it does hint at bigger plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Apple story, though, from June, gave us far more substantial information on what the company is planning to do with cars. Car rental company Hertz leased six cars to Apple for AV testing, news that sent Hertz shares up 14% after it was announced. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/26/hertz-shares-soar-after-report-apple-working-to-manage-small-autonomous-fleet.html" target="new"&gt;Neither Hertz nor Apple commented&lt;/a&gt; on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lesson to be learned here: When Tim Cook or other Apple executives are indulging hypotheticals in interviews and speaking on broad concepts like artificial intelligence, it's a safe bet that nothing particularly interesting is in the immediate pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you should really is when Apple has nothing to say at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For most people, the prospect of owning an Audi A8 is aspirational. The luxury sedan is more understated than its flashy equivalents from BMW or Mercedes-Benz but still draws double-takes from pedestrians and other drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it embodies discerning taste. That kind of taste doesn't come cheap. The retail price on a 2017 A8 starts at $82,500. So the fact that the new A8 is also going to be expensive isn't really news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When CTO of &lt;a href="http://www.valeo.com/en/" target="new"&gt;Valeo&lt;/a&gt; North America James Schwyn spoke about a forthcoming A8 at the &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/section/tcity" target="new"&gt;CAR Management Briefing Seminars&lt;/a&gt; in July, however, the price of the vehicle became an immediate point of curiosity, a situation exacerbated by the fact that Schwyn wouldn't reveal the actual price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Schwyn was there to announce that Valeo would be producing &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170731/OEM06/170739929/lidar-is-here-valeo-expects-price-to-drop-over-next-5-years" target="new"&gt;a mechanical Lidar unit that will live in the grille of the redesigned A8&lt;/a&gt;. Placement of Lidar in the grille of a car is unconventional as most units are placed on top of cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar -- or Light Detection and Ranging -- is the technology that fundamentally enables vehicles with self-driving functionality to detect their surroundings. Using millions of laser pulses per second, Lidar systems build a three-dimensional map of a vehicle's immediate environment, enabling its computer system to navigate roads efficiently and safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; does not use Lidar for its cars' autonomous functionality, and a group of ex-Tesla engineers are also &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734825" target="new"&gt;developing their own non-Lidar technology&lt;/a&gt; for self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those are the outliers, as almost all other autonomous vehicles rely upon Lidar as an essential part of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar has some issues, though, and its fundamental importance to self-driving cars amplifies those issues. Most prominently, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608348/low-quality-lidar-will-keep-self-driving-cars-in-the-slow-lane/" target="new"&gt;Lidar is expensive&lt;/a&gt;, and less expensive versions have thus far proven to be insufficient to adequately service cars that are traveling at high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Low-speed applications may be more affordable more quickly than higher-speed ones," &lt;a href="https://www.oxbotica.ai/" target="new"&gt;Oxbotica&lt;/a&gt; CEO Graeme Smith told the MIT Technology Review. "If you want a laser that's operating over 250 meters, you need a finely calibrated laser. If you're working in a lower-speed environment and can get by with 15 meters' range, then you can afford [to use] a much lower-cost sensor."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When speaking about Valeo's collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.audiusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, Schwyn acknowledged that, at least for the near future, Lidar's price point would restrict it to upmarket consumer vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The automotive market will demand a certain price point, which is an order of magnitude lower [than what it now costs]," Schwyn told Automotive News. "The market is going to be extremely limited."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did, however, express optimism for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I agree that this stuff is really expensive," he said. "But over the next generation or two, the price will come down rapidly."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who believe that a future of fully autonomous vehicles is still relatively far away often cite these issues with Lidar as the primary reason for their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, they could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidar development is a huge focus of research for companies invested in connected cars, and a major breakthrough could be right around the corner. Even if it takes longer, it might not be such a bad thing. Years of waiting for cheap-enough Lidar would not be spent idly, they'd give engineers even more time to perfect safe, efficient designs for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, in our enthusiasm for new technologies, we conveniently overlook their potential shortcomings or pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging industries have a tendency to put their collective blinders on when companies are competing with one another to be the first to establish a new market sector, and governments and consumers understandably do the same when the next big thing in tech is expected to offer great benefits to society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, everyone seems to be on their toes when it comes to the emergence of the connected car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a quintessential example of great power requiring great responsibility. While these vehicles present unprecedented opportunities for connectivity, they also could invite large-scale hacks of sensitive personal information. While self-driving cars bring obvious benefits, the idea of them being hijacked and controlled remotely is shiver-inducing. For these reasons, OEMs have been outspoken in their desire to amp up security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, though, OEMs won't get to opt in to the cybersecurity responsibilities; they'll be required to. The UK became the latest government to publish connected car guidelines, in the form of a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/624302/cyber-security-connected-automated-vehicles-key-principles.pdf" target="new"&gt;20-page document&lt;/a&gt; put together by the Department of Transport and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide outlines eight key principles, including, "Security risks are assessed and managed appropriately and proportionately, including those specific to the supply chain," and, "All organisations, including sub-contractors, suppliers and potential 3rd parties, work together to enhance the security of the system."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our cars are becoming smarter and self-driving technology will revolutionize the way in which we travel," said &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-generation-of-smart-cars-will-now-be-better-protected-from-hackers" target="new"&gt;Transport Minister Lord Callanan&lt;/a&gt;. "Risks of people hacking into the technology might be low, but we must make sure the public is protected. Whether we're turning vehicles into wifi connected hotspots or equipping them with millions of lines of code to become fully automated, it is important that they are protected against cyber-attacks."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callanan's assertion that "risks of people hacking into the technology might be low," may be comforting, but is not necessarily correct. &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/jeep-hack-chrysler-recalls-1-4m-vehicles-bug-fix/" target="new"&gt;Fiat Chrysler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/oh-good-new-hack-can-unlock-100-million-volkswagens/" target="new"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://jalopnik.com/how-a-14-year-old-hacked-a-car-with-15-worth-of-radio-1686620075" target="_blank"&gt;Delphi Automotives&lt;/a&gt; have all seen serious holes discovered in their cars' security systems. And if a Google News search for "cybersecurity" teaches anything, it's this: Anything that can be hacked will be hacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders CEO Mike Hawes, firm regulatory measures -- perhaps contrary to popular belief -- will help accelerate early adoption of forthcoming connected car tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These vehicles will transform our roads and society, dramatically reducing accidents and saving thousands of lives," he wrote in the UK guidelines. "A consistent set of guidelines is an important step towards ensuring the UK can be among the first -- and safest -- of international markets to grasp the benefits of this exciting new technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?id=06A5E941-FBC3-4A63-B9B4-523E18DADB36" target="new"&gt;the US Senate is currently working on a similar set of guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that will help establish best practices for all parts of the Internet of Things supply and development chain, especially for connected cars. While these types of resolutions may seem like no-brainers, they should not be taken for granted. If connected cars become as common as most predictions say, the safety and security of many will be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Every major auto maker is racing to capitalize on the autonomous car market's enormous potential. They're staffing up, acquiring new companies and capabilities and innovating at an unprecedented pace. They know they can't afford to be left behind.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;However, this competitive free-for-all could have huge downsides: redundant and wasteful investments, fragmented critical safety standards, and simply unsustainable business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examining the current model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Software is at the core of autonomous vehicles. The functionality, experience, and dynamics -- from dashboard instruments to the powertrain to safety systems to in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) -- are all defined by software. Simply put, autonomous car OEMs are now in the software business, competing on software innovation and cycle times. They all want to be the smartest and fastest with each new innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that auto makers are creating their own software models in isolation. As such, each and every software element must be individually secured, made safe and compliant, then translated into a production-ready commercial product. In this one-off fashion, every company in the value chain ends up investing more money, hiring more people and incurring longer delays than necessary.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;These inefficiencies would then be passed on to consumers, translating to excessively high prices and possibly slower adoptions rates for autonomous cars, which in turn diminishes the market opportunity for OEMs, Tier 1s and service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally troubling, autonomous car software complexity makes it all the more challenging for auto makers to maintain scalability as it moves from the drawing board into production. Most auto makers are relatively inexperienced in software-based business models and will have difficulty keeping pace with the accelerating rate of change. Scaling up and into production will be a daunting challenge without core software elements standardization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cooperate on standards and compete on delivery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

It's clear that a more efficient model for creating and deploying autonomous vehicle software is in need. By looking to other industries with mission-critical software components, such as aerospace and defense, players in the autonomous car market can learn from these past successes. These other mission-critical industries have taken an open standards software approach that includes two basic tenets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core mission-critical elements of the software stack should be a given. They should be based on open standards that are accessible to all -- so that innovation can focus on adding value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive differentiation should derive from innovation around the open software standard and the development of commercial products based on the standard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look to other mission-critical industries for similar examples. Rather than create a proprietary software framework, a major avionics player created a common core system (CCS) based on the ARINC 653 specification, which enabled a diverse ecosystem of suppliers to deliver software that executed on this common platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARINC standards, which relate to elements such as avionics, cabin systems, protocols and interfaces, are used by thousands of commercial aircrafts. ARINC industry activities collaboratively establish industry-wide, consensus-based, voluntary technical aviation standards. The new CCS platform then led to the creation of RTCA DO-297, a new standard that defined business roles -- platform suppliers, applications suppliers and systems integrators -- as well as processes and workflow for those roles. This role-based business methodology evolved into the current, global standard for all large commercial aircraft development today. Ultimately, an entire industry came together and their cooperative approach to standards accelerated and optimized innovation and efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that open standards are not the same as open source. Open standards are guidelines that are publicly available and democratically controlled by a community. Open source is the software code itself that's freely available, subject to the terms of a licensing agreement. Whether or not the software is open source is not the issue here. The core issue is the urgent need for industry-wide agreement on a set of open standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This smarter, more cooperative approach to open standards, particularly for mission-critical infrastructure elements such as operating systems and safety-related software, will accelerate opportunities in the autonomous car market. Open standards will drive innovation, lower costs, prevent software code volume inflation, ensure scalability, reduce safety risks and make production practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Next steps on the road to open software standards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

To best move the autonomous car market forward, we need industry leaders to drive the discussion around open software standards, engage all market players, and organize a standards body that can help determine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which standards are needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How open standards will be defined, created, and regulated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which elements of intellectual property (IP) need to be standardized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which open standards have the highest potential for generating innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which open standards create the highest potential for risk, and how best to mitigate that risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By defining and adhering to autonomous open standards, the auto industry can bridge the gap between the need for cost-efficient commercial differentiation and the imperative to protect consumers in an age of accelerating innovation. The time for a smarter and more collaborative approach is now.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to places in America that hold great symbolic significance in  transportation, New York City ranks right up there with Detroit and Kitty Hawk, N.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the largest city in the US, New York is home to the largest public transportation system in the country. It's not even close. Annual NYC ridership is more than ten times that of Chicago, the next-closest system in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is fitting then that New York would be involved as the next great revolution in transportation -- the introduction of self-driving cars -- unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, &lt;a href="http://www.cadillac.com/" target="new"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt; started a 16-state journey using its hands-free freeway driving system, Super Cruise. The autonomous vehicle ride began in New York City and will conclude in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are proud to work hand-in-hand with government officials to continue to develop new technologies that will define the future of transportation in the US," Cadillac president &lt;a href="http://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2017/sep/0925-hands-free.html" target="new"&gt;Johan de Nysschen said&lt;/a&gt; at a press conference at New York City's &lt;a href="http://www.cadillac.com/world-of-cadillac/cadillac-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cadillac House&lt;/a&gt;. "It's especially fitting to kick off this drive in New York City, the home of Cadillac's new global headquarters, and we're honored to have the support of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, both of whom foster New York's leadership in innovation and cutting-edge technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_rxW68ADldI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cross-country journey will be a joint effort between 12 Super Cruise-equipped Cadillac CT6 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cars will be staffed by Cadillac technicians, but they likely won't be doing much driving. Super Cruise, which is designed to function on the 130,000 miles of limited access freeways in the US, will guide itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For safety, Super Cruise has several conditions that must be met for it to operate. It must be on a limited access freeway, the vehicle's sensor system must be clean and unobstructed, and lane markings must be clearly visible and can't be obscured by debris or glare. Critically, the vehicle's human driver must be focused, as a driver attention camera ensures that he or she is ready to take over if called upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York appears to be ever-present on the minds of those looking to innovate in the realm of self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city's grid structure provides an appealing platform for autonomous vehicles, while its notorious congestion poses a unique sort of challenge. This past summer, architecture and design firm EDG unveiled a plan known as &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734826" target="new"&gt;Loop NYC&lt;/a&gt;, which proposed serious facelifts to city infrastructure in order to bring driverless cars to the city's streets in the future. And Cadillac's Super Cruise journey is not the company's first foray into forward-thinking NYC transportation solutions. In June, the automaker &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lianeyvkoff/2017/06/29/cadillac-partners-with-blade-for-free-helicopter-rides-to-the-hamptons/#581661c261b4" target="new"&gt;partnered&lt;/a&gt; with Uber-for-helicopters startup Blade to offer free chopper rides to the Hamptons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Cadillac's bread and butter is on-the-road performance, and that's exactly what the company believes it has pushed forward with the introduction of Super Cruise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Cadillac is setting new industry standards with ground-breaking driver assistance technologies like Super Cruise, the world's first true hands-free driving system for the freeway," said Nysschen. "We are excited to bring Super Cruise, a true testament to Cadillac's innovative spirit and technical capability, on its first-ever hands-free drive on freeways from coast to coast."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As the company dealt with a series of wide-ranging, high-profile scandals, Sherif Marakby, Uber's vice president of global vehicle programs, was one of many executives to leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;At Uber, he had helped launch and then head its self-driving car program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Self-driving is one of the most interesting challenges I've worked on in my career, and I'm grateful to have contributed to what will soon be a safer future for everyone," &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170417/MOBILITY/170419851/uber-loses-another-top-executive-as-marakby-departs" target="new"&gt;Marakby noted&lt;/a&gt; in a statement when he left Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn't take Marakby long to find a new gig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to working at Uber, Marakby had spent 25 years working at &lt;a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, and after leaving the ride-sharing company he headed back to the company to continue his work on autonomous vehicles, this time as vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in a Medium post, Marakby has announced that Ford has joined forces with &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;, Uber's foremost rival, to "take self-driving cars mainstream."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way Marakby describes it, Ford will introduce its own, human-driven vehicles into Lyft's services, and simultaneously integrate its platform interface into Lyft's customer-facing platform. Only after that has been successfully achieved will driverless cars enter the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We also will connect our self-driving test vehicles to Lyft's network," &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/how-ford-and-lyft-are-teaming-up-to-take-self-driving-cars-mainstream-9bf2974a912a" target="new"&gt;Marakby writes&lt;/a&gt;. "We don't, however, plan to put customers in them until we are certain our technology delivers a positive, reassuring experience where we can gain meaningful feedback. When ready, we'll have self-driving cars operating alongside Lyft's current community of drivers to help accommodate times of significant consumer demand to ensure that transportation remains timely and affordable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford isn't Lyft's first major automaker partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-lyft-investment/gm-invests-500-million-in-lyft-sets-out-self-driving-car-partnership-idUSKBN0UI1A820160105" target="new"&gt;GM invested $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in Lyft in exchange for a 9% stake in the company, announcing at the time that a significant amount of its involvement with Lyft would be in the pursuit of developing various autonomous vehicle. In May of that year, the two companies formally announced plans to test &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-lyft-to-test-self-driving-electric-taxis-1462460094" target="new"&gt;self-driving electric taxis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past February, &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/02/17/gm-lyft-chevy-bolt-fleet/" target="new"&gt;Fortune reported&lt;/a&gt; that the companies would begin deploying self-driving Chevy Volts in 2018. And in May, Lyft signed a deal with Waymo to collaborate on autonomous vehicle tech. Fox Business's Matthew Rocco &lt;a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/05/15/gm-winner-as-lyft-inks-self-driving-deal-with-waymo.html" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the deal may have put GM "squarely in the driver's seat" in the self-driving space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford, clearly, was not willing to cede this leadership position. In his Medium post, Marakby identifies three key questions that Ford hopes to discover through its work with Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How do we create our technology platform so that it can easily connect with a partner's platform (such as Lyft's) to effectively dispatch a self-driving vehicle?" he asks. "Based on our shared data and information, which cities should we work with to deliver our self-driving vehicle service? [And] what kind of infrastructure will be necessary to service and maintain a fleet of self-driving vehicles to ensure they are available whenever a consumer needs one?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to those questions will go a long way to providing a clear picture of the future, not just for Ford and Lyft, but for the entire autonomous vehicle sector.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation Chairman John Thune (R-SD) and Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) have spent a lot of 2017 thinking about self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the senators have been considering all of the good that autonomous vehicles can do for the economy, the environment and road safety, and the role the federal government should play in getting them on the road while making safety the utmost priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, the bipartisan duo of Thune and Peters &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/319256-senators-plot-bipartisan-bill-on-self-driving-cars" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its intention to develop legislation on the matter, and they discussed it at a full committee hearing this past summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The transportation laws and regulations currently on the books did not contemplate the concept of self-driving vehicles," Thune said &lt;a href="https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/6/thune-it-s-time-to-move-forward-with-self-driving-vehicle-legislation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt;. "Current federal motor vehicle safety standards do not address automated technologies, and in some cases directly conflict with them. We are looking for ways to address these conflicts in dated rules without weakening the important vehicle safety protections they provide."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of that effort were revealed when the American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies (AV START) Act was introduced by Peters and Thune on September 28. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This legislation proposes common sense changes in law to keep pace with advances in self-driving technology," &lt;a href="https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-thune-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-advance-development-of-self-driving-vehicles" target="new"&gt;said Thune&lt;/a&gt;. "By playing a constructive role in the development of self-driving transportation systems, our government can help save lives, improve mobility for all Americans -- including those with disabilities, and create new jobs by making us leaders in this important technology. I'm proud of this bipartisan legislation but recognize there are still opportunities to make it even better, and I look forward to working with colleagues as we head toward a committee vote next week."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=F79D49D6-AA78-45BB-BC54-075A361FB56D" target="new"&gt;notes that&lt;/a&gt; two of the foremost benefits of the AV START Act will be that it "provides enhanced safety oversight" and "reduces barriers to deployment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These goals might be at odds with one another, however. The most obvious barriers to deployment are measures of safety oversight. To achieve these aims simultaneously, the Act seeks to ensure that most autonomous vehicle regulation is done in the form of exchanges between OEMs and the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AV START Act "requires manufacturers to submit safety evaluation reports to the Secretary of Transportation with information addressing important factors including safety, crashworthiness, and cybersecurity through documented testing, validation, and assessment," reads a press release. "Such reports must be submitted prior to the testing or deployment of a self-driving vehicle."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate legislation is the second AV bill to be introduced in congress this year, with the first having been the similarly bipartisan &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736110" target="new"&gt;SELF DRIVE Act&lt;/a&gt; in the House. Of the SELF DRIVE Act's many proposals, the most publicized has been the included measure that will increase the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's annual exemptions for autonomous vehicles from 5,000 to 25,000 immediately and, over the course of three years, to 100,000. The same proposal is included in Thune and Peters's AV START Act. Other stated functions of the AV START Act are that it "reinforces federal, state, and local roles," "brings existing rules up to speed," and "strengthens cybersecurity."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When autonomous vehicles first become commonplace on public roads in the coming years, vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V) will allow cars to "talk" to one another, helping prevent accidents and easing the flow of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication will play a similar role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By enabling vehicles to connect with a central infrastructure network, V2I tech -- very little of which is currently operational -- helps individual vehicles safely navigate the roads by arming them with as much information as possible from the roads themselves. In theory, self-driving cars could even operate without sensors in an optimized, fully connected V2I setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, more advanced forms of the prospective "I" in V2I will be tremendously expensive, and could take years or even decades to fully implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile, the autonomous vehicles that would take advantage of V2I are advancing at a much quicker pace, with many OEMs aiming to have self-driving cars on the road by 2020 or 2021. That means the first generation of self-driving vehicles will have to do without a central network helping guide them. That's not to say, however, that they'll be without any help on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Connected Roads division of manufacturing conglomerate &lt;a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/" target="new"&gt;3M&lt;/a&gt;, teams of scientists and developers have long worked to make roads safer in ways that are practical, achievable and inexpensive -- which, in the sector of on-the-road safety solutions, makes them unique, innovative and attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I've seen lots of different innovation around [truly connected infrastructure] -- embedding materials, luminescence, connectivity," 3M business manager Colin Sultan told &lt;a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90140902/smart-roads-are-coming-do-we-need-them" target="new"&gt;Fast Co. Design&lt;/a&gt;. "That all is extremely expensive. The solutions that we're talking about are solutions we can actually do very quickly and very inexpensively."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1990s, 3M has been making key road markings easy to see for drivers, especially in adverse weather conditions. Those products include refractive beads that make lane markings reflective and easily visible in the rain; retroreflective sign materials that absorb a great amount of light, making signs easier to see in the dark; and fluorescent technology that make caution cones and traffic control signs more visible in order to protect road workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, 3M has also been developing road visibility technology that is designed specifically for the car of tomorrow. In May, the company partnered with the Michigan Department of Transportation to design and install visibility technology that was specially tailored to the sensors that outfit autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"3M will be providing MDOT with advanced all-weather lane markings, retroreflective signs with smart sign technology and DSRC (dedicated short-range communication) devices for vehicle to infrastructure communications," the company wrote in &lt;a href="http://news.3m.com/press-release/company-english/3m-and-michigan-department-transportation-partner-nations-first-connec" target="new"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; announcing the partnership. "The updated, modern materials will allow for redundancy and greater machine vision, as well as improved driver safety on the roadways."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not as complex as some of the more expensive, advanced forms of autonomous vehicle infrastructure, the products that 3M offers still require great care -- smart signage technology, for instance, has been shown to be &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735307" target="new"&gt;vulnerable to hacks&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, preventing those missteps is something that 3M, with its extensive history of making roads safer, is uniquely poised to do.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In certain parts of the country, people have already had the privilege of being chauffeured by self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pittsburgh, Uber customers may find that an autonomous Volvo XC90 will pull up to take them to their destination. In San Francisco, employees of GM's Cruise Automation get the incredible workplace perk of accessing autonomous ride-hailing using the company's own vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these cars are technically self-driving, they are required by law to have human monitors in their front seats, ready to take over in case of emergency. It's a driverless experience, but it doesn't always seem that way when there's a person sitting in the driver's seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/the-people-who-matter-at-waymo" target="new"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; from journalist Amir Efrati at The Information, &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; is looking to launch its own driverless car network in Arizona as early as this fall, with a distinction that would set it apart from all other autonomous vehicle ride-hailing services: There won't be a driver in the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain folks within Waymo would like the service to begin picking up passengers before the end of October, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That certainly seems ambitious, given that the company has not made any such intentions public. Even with a public announcement, launching such an unprecedented service within a month of announcing would still be an aggressive move. According to The Information, that aggression has been a major source of contention within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Efrati tells it, Google founders and Alphabet bosses Larry Page and Sergey Brin have actively been pushing for deadlines that engineers at Waymo consider to be unreasonably soon, while also implementing hiring freezes that employees deem to be hamstringing their progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught in the middle, it seems, is CEO John Krafcik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In The Information's report, Waymo engineers see Krafcik as having sided with superiors because he doesn't have an adequate understanding of the complexities of self-driving technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company does appear to be doing what its leaders say, and that appears to be launching an autonomous ride-hailing service. But what about that whole no-driver thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, federal law dictates that any self-driving car must be accompanied by a licensed human operator. But Waymo's decision to pursue this particular venture in Arizona, perhaps the most permissive state in the US with regards to AV testing laws in the country, is no coincidence. A September 2015 executive order by Gov. Douglas Ducey appears to have left a loophole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Pilot programs will be enabled on campuses of selected universities in partnership with entities that are developing technology for self-driving vehicles, whereby an operator with a valid driver's license may direct a vehicle's movement, regardless of whether the operator is physically present in the vehicle or is providing direction remotely while the vehicle is operating in self-driving mode," reads &lt;a href="https://azgovernor.gov/file/2660/download?token=nLkPLRi1" target="new"&gt;the order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo, it seems, will monitor its vehicles remotely -- and control them remotely, when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The company has built a real-time command center that allows self-driving cars to 'phone home' and consult human operators about the best way to deal with situations it finds confusing," writes Timothy B. Lee at &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/report-waymo-aiming-to-launch-commercial-driverless-service-this-year/" target="new"&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;. "The ability to remotely monitor vehicles and give timely feedback on tricky situations will be essential if Waymo hopes to eliminate the human driver from its cars."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the trickiest situation may be navigating the internal politics at Waymo and Alphabet, and there isn't an artificial intelligence fix for that problem.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Everything about our roads, from the physical structures themselves to the rules that govern them, is designed for human drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is so obvious that it goes largely overlooked, but the development of autonomous vehicles in recent years has made clear the ways in which automobile travel has been built for man and not for machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While road markings can be detected by the sensor systems in self-driving cars, they were originally designed to be seen by human eyes. Road signs, too, can be perceived and understood by autonomous systems, but there are far better ways of conveying directions to machines than red octagons and yellow triangles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia, the National Transport Commission has already spent significant time researching how roads will need to change to best take advantage of the safety and convenience benefits of self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, the commission published a discussion paper entitled "Changing Driving Laws to Support Automated Vehicles," a lengthy report that, if nothing else, enumerates all of the conceivable adjustments that need to be made to accommodate autonomous vehicles in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics of the paper range from fundamental ("What does 'drive' mean?") to more concrete ("Legislative approaches to recognize an Automated Driving System"). But one topic that stands out as particularly interesting is the topic of drunk driving -- or, in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, drunk riding. The report asserts that Australia ought to consider making drunk "driving" legal in cars that are driving themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"One potential barrier to receiving the full benefits of automated vehicles would be to require occupants of automated vehicles, who are not driving, to comply with drink-driving laws," reads &lt;a href="http://www.ntc.gov.au/Media/Reports/(E5695ACE-993C-618F-46E1-A876391B8CD9).pdf" target="new"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. "This would create a barrier to using a vehicle to safely drive home after drinking. Enabling people to use an automated vehicle to drive them home despite having consumed alcohol has the potential to improve road safety outcomes by reducing the incidence of drink-driving."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comission's logic is sound, and exempting autonomous vehicle operators from drunk driving laws would seem to be a no-brainer, considering that they aren't actually driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of the positive publicity behind AVs centers around the prospective safety benefits, and part of that will come from a reduction in the number of drunk drivers on the roads. As the paper goes on to point out, though, there is still the possibility that drunk autonomous vehicle passengers would have the power to make dangerous decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A risk of providing exemptions is that an occupant may subsequently choose to take over driving the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs," it remarks. "If this occurred, they would become the driver of the vehicle and drink and drug driving offences would apply."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is further complicated by the fact that we will see semi-autonomous cars on the road long before Level 5, fully autonomous vehicles. These cars may be able to complete entire routine trips by themselves, but still require that a human occupant be alert so they can take over operations if necessary. So until fully autonomous vehicles are on the road, don't expect to see major adjustments to drunk driving laws.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The structures of our roads are designed to provide guidance for human drivers, and they will behave much the same way when autonomous vehicles come online in big numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lane markings give self-driving cars a defined space in which to operate, speed limits give AVs an understanding of how fast they should travel at any given spot on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are certainly still challenges for driverless developers, ultimately the current framework that road markings and other infrastructure provide makes operating driverless cars easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that all goes out the window when designing an autonomous system for off-road vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are things such as level surfaces and land markings. An autonomous off-road vehicle would need an enhanced sensor suite to gauge a constantly changing environment with incredible accuracy. It would also require a deep understanding of its own performance capabilities to draw the line between "go" and "no go."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since many of the "rules of the road" quite simply don't exist off-road, a higher level of artificial intelligence would be required to help a vehicle know how to behave in different situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the challenge, &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; recently filed a patent for an off-road autonomous vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A vehicle system includes a processor with access to a memory storing instructions executable by the processor," reads the &lt;a href="http://www.freshpatents.com/-dt20171109ptan20170320495.php" target="new"&gt;patent's abstract&lt;/a&gt;. "The instructions include determining whether an autonomous host vehicle can traverse an environmental obstacle, and if the autonomous host vehicle can traverse the environmental obstacle, controlling an active suspension system in accordance with the environmental obstacle and controlling the autonomous host vehicle to traverse the environmental obstacle."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensors that would provide data for the vehicle's processors are in line with the typical hardware components that we see on self-driving cars: Lidar, radar, cameras and transponder sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it stands to reason that this equipment would behave differently off-road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patent also indicates that signals received from navigation systems, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity could inform the operating system, although it's unclear how often the latter two would be applicable in a situation where vehicles and infrastructure don't tend to be present in abundance. Also listed as a form of sensing is an "inertial measuring unit," which would track the vehicle's movement on rocky terrain and interpret it to best perform future maneuvering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who enjoy off-roading, the main appeal lies in the human challenge of maneuvering the vehicle. A fully self-driving off-road automobile would take most of the fun out of the activity. A more likely scenario is a semi-autonomous truck that would be able to identify situations where the vehicle could more safely pass without passengers inside. Instead of turning around or taking a different path, drivers could exit the vehicle, watch it maneuver itself over a tough piece of terrain, and then resume driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a niche use case for a consumer-facing autonomous vehicle, but the underlying technology have wide-ranging applications in industry and military contexts, as well.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Two major factors have contributed to the widespread belief that ride-sharing and ride-hailing fleets will continue to see booming growth in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is the staggering success that Uber and Lyft have already enjoyed. Even former skeptics are now convinced that Americans are comfortable ordering rides on a smartphone app, being driven around by a rotating cast of strangers and sometimes sharing those rides with other strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other factor is the emergence of driverless vehicle technology, which figures to make cars in ride-hailing fleets available 24/7, thereby reducing costs (and also eliminating the element of being driven around by a rotating cast of strangers, which some still deem to be undesirable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in case anyone needed further proof about how serious those ride-sharing companies are in their autonomous ambitions, it came on November 20, when &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; announced that it had reached an agreement with &lt;a href="http://www.volvo.com/home.html" target="new"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; to purchase up to 24,000 "autonomous drive compatible" XC-90s between 2019 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/11/20/uber-volvo-xc90-driverless-autonomous-car-deal/#6ce065eb7a03"target="new"&gt;deal is believed&lt;/a&gt; to be worth $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its statement, Volvo made a clear attempt to position itself as a spiritual compatriot to Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The automotive industry is being disrupted by technology and Volvo Cars chooses to be an active part of that disruption," &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/216738/volvo-cars-to-supply-tens-of-thousands-of-autonomous-drive-compatible-cars-to-uber" target="new"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; President and CEO Hakan Samuelsson, noted in a statement. "Our aim is to be the supplier of choice for ride-sharing service providers globally. Today's agreement with Uber is a primary example of that strategic direction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important component in the competition to establish autonomous ride-hailing services is the ability to create and maintain a fleet large enough to make this type of service scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, OEMs held a major advantage over tech companies in this respect, thanks to their ability to actually manufacture the vehicles. But with this move, Uber has shown that acquiring a major fleet isn't all that much harder than signing a hefty check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How exactly Uber plans to use its 24,000 new Volvos remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the fall of 2016, the company began testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh with real passengers in the back. The significance was somewhat diminished by the fact that the vehicles required two human operators in the front seat to keep an eye on things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this past September, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736654" target="new"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; the latest iteration of its autonomous XC-90s, which now require only one human attendant, and it's likely that Uber will soon try to match its &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;competitor Waymo&lt;/a&gt; by operating a fleet without any human operator at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the size of the deal could indicate that Uber has its sights set beyond Pittsburgh. Expanding its autonomous ride-hailing to new locations could dramatically help Uber, which already has better name recognition than Waymo, in its attempt to become the market leader.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For people who have never ridden in a self-driving car, it's easy to imagine that the physical sensation is the same as a regular car, minus a human driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a train, plane or other forms of passive transportation, self-driving cars don't move in a particularly linear fashion. Riding in the "driver's" seat of an autonomous vehicle as it makes unexpected turns and stops can result in a serious case of motion sickness.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that a passenger freed from keeping his or her eyes on the road will likely look down at the screen of a mobile device instead only compounds the chances of getting carsick. While far from the most serious challenge confronting AV engineers, it is nevertheless an important one since the already difficult task of changing consumer behavior and showing them that autonomous vehicles are a viable form of transportation only becomes harder if those consumers are constantly losing their lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, it seems, has already developed some ideas for how to minimize motion sickness for its autonomous vehicle passengers. A &lt;a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20170313326" target="new"&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; filed by the company on November 2 proposes a series of potential solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With the advent of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, rider attention may be focused on alternative activities, such as work, socializing, reading, writing, task-based activities (e.g., organization, bill payments, online shopping, gameplay) and the like," reads the background section of the patent application. "As the AV travels along an inputted route, kinetosis (i.e., motion sickness) can result from the perception of motion by a rider for not corresponding to the rider's vestibular senses."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One proposal is a light system inside the car to alert passengers about the times and locations of the autonomous system's planned turns and brakes. It would be similar to the turn signals and brake lights on the outside of a car that currently allow human drivers to communicate their actions and intentions to others, but would instead be designed for riders inside the very car from whence the signals come. When turns and stops are anticipated, they're far less likely to disrupt a passenger's sense of orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the patent acknowledges, passengers may very well be engrossed in their own activities.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rider deep into a novel could easily miss such light signals. So other ideas in the patent application would affect passengers whether they were attentive or not. Seats could subtly twist along with turns, counteracting the movement of the car. Seats could also provide haptic feedback, vibrating during braking to alert the passenger. Also proposed are airflow systems that would soothe riders and stimulate them in a way that distracted their body from the feeling of turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Samuel Gibbs at The Guardian &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/21/uber-cure-travel-sickness-self-driving-car-light-air-blasts-moving-seats-patent?CMP=twt_a-technology_b-gdntech#img-1" target="new"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, research suggests varying degrees of effectiveness for these methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A recent study published in Experimental Brain Research showed that airflow systems have been effective at reducing motion sickness, although seat vibration showed no improvement in testing," Gibbs writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicles face bigger obstacles on the road to full implementation than the absolute comfort of passengers. But the fact that we've reached a point where this issue is now on the table means that we're closer to our autonomous future than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The modern automotive industry does not revolve around vertically integrated companies with end-to-end control from production to assembly to sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead it's a more diverse business model, with different companies each working on a specific piece of the puzzle. This becomes even more true as connected cars and autonomous vehicles, which require specialized hardware and software, become more prevalent.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While those ancillary businesses may not receive the recognition of an OEM, they are still large businesses with the potential to drive significant revenue numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/" target="new"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; is a company that doesn't have to worry about name recognition. It is a tech giant, manufacturing some of the world's best-known televisions and smartphones. But in the automotive space, Samsung's position is less established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that may be changing soon, according to Samsung President and CSO Young Sohn. Speaking with &lt;a href="http://europe.autonews.com/article/20171125/ANE/171119886/samsung-expects-fourfold-boost-in-auto-revenue-on-self-driving-cars" target="new"&gt;Automotive News Europe&lt;/a&gt;, Sohn said that he sees the rise of autonomous vehicles as a tremendous opportunity for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automotive category is currently about a $5 billion business for Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's not much for Samsung, because we make $200 billion in revenue, but I'm hoping over time that this portion will increase and we will hit $20 billion by 2025," Sohn said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connected cars utilize great amounts of network data to power advanced driver assistance services and infotainment system features like GPS navigation and music streaming. As connected vehicles become autonomous vehicles, the amount of data used will expand exponentially as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity become essential whenever the car is in operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When you have your data increase by 100,000 times, then suddenly everything you do around your plumbing has to change," said Sohn. "That's like having a small data center in your rear trunk, it's a tremendous opportunity for IT companies like us."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has now been a year since Samsung made a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-to-acquire-harman-accelerating-growth-in-automotive-and-connected-technologies" target="new"&gt;big splash&lt;/a&gt; with its $8 billion purchase of automotive electronics company &lt;a href="https://www.harman.com/" target="new"&gt;Harman&lt;/a&gt;. In September of this year, Samsung launched both a $300 million fund for automotive investments and a joint business unit with Harman to pursue innovation in the AV space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in September, it was revealed that Samsung had &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41122102" target="new"&gt;obtained a permit&lt;/a&gt; to test self-driving cars on public roads in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly Samsung plans to test remains unknown, but all of these comments and partnerships show that the company isn't expecting its revenue to grow passively. Samsung is taking an active role in becoming a major player in the automotive space.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In-vehicle entertainment is a sector that was primed for disruption even before the recent connected car boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when in-vehicle entertainment meant looking out the window, but since screens started popping up in the back of headrests in the early 2000s, infotainment systems have come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early options required localized content -- most likely in the form of a DVD player -- but now services like streaming music and GPS navigation are commonplace. All of those iterations, however, still operate within the framework of a human in the driver's seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, with the rise of the self-driving car on the horizon, most automotive insiders are convinced that the real infotainment boom is yet to arrive. When drivers don't need to pay attention to the road, the theory goes, they'll be free to shop online, play video games or watch movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At November's Los Angeles Auto Show, &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" target="new"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/" target="new"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; announced a joint venture that could take things even further. The software and entertainment giants unveiled an initiative called the AV Entertainment Experience to create immersive amusement specifically tailored to passengers of self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Warner Bros. and Intel imagine significant possibilities inside the AV space. Not only do we see passengers consuming content ranging from movies and television programming, we imagine riders enjoying immersive experiences never seen before, courtesy of in-cabin virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) innovations," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/autonomous-driving-todays-biggest-game-changer/" target="new"&gt;an online editorial&lt;/a&gt; describing the venture. "For example, a fan of the superhero Batman could enjoy riding in the Batmobile through the streets of Gotham City, while AR capabilities render the car a literal lens to the outside world, enabling passengers to view advertising and other discovery experiences."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krzanich's post represents a significant departure from the traditional streaming of movies and TV that most non-driving passengers are already doing on their phones or tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel and Warner Bros. aim to transition passengers from being passive consumers into active participants in the content they view. Augmented reality and virtual reality can adjust a user's perception of their environment or place them into a new environment entirely. Making those new experiences appealing to wary consumers, though, could become easier if the experiences revolve around known intellectual property, like Batman, which Warner Bros. possesses in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also interesting possibilities for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying for billboard advertisements, on-route restaurants may opt for animations that, through augmented reality, appear above their establishments in a passenger's field of vision. Such digital advertisements, they could be updated instantaneously to reflect of-the-moment deals or be customized to individual AV passengers' preferences. It's a lucrative business opportunity for advertisers, automobile manufacturers, infotainment system designers and network service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the restrictions of driving have limited the possibilities for in-vehicle entertainment. But with the concurrent emergence of driverless technology alongside VR and AR tech, the car may soon represent an even better opportunity for entertainment than the home.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most widely anticipated trend in the next few decades of automotives is a massive shift from private vehicle ownership toward ride-sharing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons for consumers to be excited about this, including costs savings and increased convenience. The demise of private car ownership, however, will rightfully be mourned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of the positives that come with ride sharing, there are still a lot of great things about owning a car. One of the biggest benefits is customization. When you have your own ride, you can tune every element to your exact preference. When you ride in a different, anonymous vehicle every time you make a trip, that's far from the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harman.com/" target="new"&gt;Harman International&lt;/a&gt; wants to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CES 2018 in Las Vegas, the Samsung subsidiary unveiled two new user experience solutions, known as Configurable Entertainment and Moodscape, that will allow passengers in equipped ride-hailing fleet vehicles to customize the in-vehicle settings exactly how they like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to their vehicles, today's consumers are all about the experience and are less concerned about the technology behind it. At Harman, we are constantly focused on innovating with the passenger in mind, integrating emerging technology with software-driven audio to provide the effortless, responsive experiences consumers have come to expect," Harman's president of lifestyle audio Michael Mauser wrote in a &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/new-harman-ux-solutions-deliver-unprecedented-in-car-comfort-and-entertainment-experiences-at-ces-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Moodscape and Configurable Entertainment are perfect examples of how we're reinventing what is possible in the vehicle today, as well as for the autonomous future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configurable Entertainment leverages Harman's industry-leading position in the automotive speakers space to offer passengers their preferred sound design for the specific media they're using. Someone riding in a Configurable Entertainment-equipped car could use JBL audio while gaming, or Harman Kardon audio while listening to music thanks to "shape-shifting speakers" that sound more like a Transformer than an audio component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In-vehicle speakers transform in real-time to provide different experiences in line with user preferences," according to the release. "A unique sound bar or tweeter can dynamically morph from one audio brand experience to another, both sonically and visually."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moodscape is designed for passengers who are feeling stressed, contemplative, tired or energetic. Citing growing consumer interest in the "wellness" space, Harman developed Moodscape to adjust the emotions of a passenger. A feature known as Music Motivator "identifies GPS routes and analyzes available biometric feedback to build and deliver an audio experience based on passengers' whereabouts, schedule and energy level."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the coolest feature of Moodscape is the so-called QLED MoodRoof, which projects an immersive environment onto the car's internal ceiling. While you actually may be riding through downtown Boston, MoodRoof can make it feel as if you're being guided through a snowy forest or a sunny beach town depending on your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the joy of driving home after a long day is being in your own personal space. As consumers transition toward making that drive in a ride-hailing vehicle, Harman is trying to preserve that idea of personal space with Configurable Entertainment and Moodscape. While a passenger may not own the car, he or she can still own the experience.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In March 2017, Samsung acquired Harman International for $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a hefty sum, but the move was a way for &lt;a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/" target="new"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; to instantly gain greater access into the automotive sector, where &lt;a href="http://www.harman.com/" target="new"&gt;Harman&lt;/a&gt; was an established leader in electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of connected cars and the imminent arrival of self-driving cars, technology is largely the driving force behind automotives, and as one of the world's largest tech companies Samsung couldn't afford to not play a role in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than a year later, the industry is seeing some of the first products emerge from the partnership partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this years's CES, Samsung and Harman unveiled three new products for connected and driverless cars: a digital cockpit platform, a 5G automotive telematics solution and an autonomous driving platform known as DRVLINE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging the power of Harman's &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735132" target="new"&gt;Ignite platform&lt;/a&gt;, the new cockpit solution from Harman and Samsung empowers drivers with an interface perfectly suited for the next generation of automotives. All three levels of configuration -- low, medium and high -- offer cloud services to lower costs for the infotainment system, and even vehicle weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium configuration of the Digital Cockpit stands apart from similar products on the market today. Services such as virtual personal assistants and augmented reality can be integrated across as many as four displays. Plus, vehicle preference profiles can be taken from one vehicle to the next. That means that even though the ride-hailing and ride-sharing services may expand, a passenger utilizing the Digital Cockpit platform can still make every vehicle he enters feel like his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connected car, as game-changing as it has already been, is far from a complete product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believed that the technology won't be fully maximized until 5G mobile connectivity is widespread. 5G networks promise incredibly fast connection speeds. Some experts believe they may even replace WiFi. But because industry standards for 5G are yet to be determined, companies have found it hard to prepare for this future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its 5G automotive telematics solution, Samsung and Harman, however, have developed a product that can work with the LTE CAT 16 connectivity of today and be instantly ready for the 5G networks of tomorrow. With up to 1GB per second bandwidth, this telematics solution has the potential speed to enable the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) capabilities that will empower self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In designing its autonomous platform DRVLINE, Samsung and Harman wanted to create a future-proofed product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to build an autonomous driving platform because the potential business from creating the one that becomes ubiquitous across all driverless cars is enormous. The problem is that no one is sure exactly what the technology of tomorrow will look like. With DRVLINE, Samsung and Harman claim to have developed software that is so versatile and customizable that it will be able to serve the AV sector as technology progresses towards Level 5 autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The industry has made incredible advances in automation, yet in-car compute is still a long way from approximating the power of our brains," Harman/Samsung executive John Absmeier wrote in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-reveals-drvline-platform-autonomous-future/" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The DRVLINE platform with its open and high-level compute capability is a first major first step toward building an ecosystem to support full autonomy."&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Hyundai Motor Company and Cisco announced a new partnership to develop a connected car platform with a focus on security and the optimization of data flow, both in and out of a vehicle and within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Future connected cars will open new innovations in quality, safety, and security, as never before. By expanding time and space, more safety will be guaranteed for our customers," &lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt; vice chairman Euisun Chung &lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/about-hyundai/news/corporate_hyundai-motor-and-cisco-collaborate-for-global-connected-car-project-20160419.aspx" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. "This collaboration will be a chance to bring closer the Hyundai Motor-led future of connected cars and shift paradigms of new mobility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than two years later, at CES 2018 in Las Vegas, the two companies announced that they are close to delivering on the promise of an entirely new connected car platform that is flexible, secure, highly configurable, and designed not just to accommodate innovation, but actively encourage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Hyundai and &lt;a href="https://www.cisco.com/" target="new"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; plan to unveil a jointly developed connected car based on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Cisco is pleased to bring a standards-based approach in partnership with the automotive industry; one that will help accelerate innovation and increase the value to the consumer," Cisco Vice President Ruba Borno wrote in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;amp;articleId=1903971" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "By creating a flexible, scalable, and secure platform, we are allowing automotive companies to deliver better cars -- faster."&lt;/p&gt;

{videoembed|739856}

&lt;p&gt;Cisco and Hyundai say that the key to the platform is an emphasis on what they call Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) architecture, a method of design that ensures the ability to reconfigure and build upon the platform in the future. This is one of the most important characteristics a modern vehicle platform can possess, as the lightning-fast speed of technological change and growth in the connected car space guarantees substantial adjustments to vehicle software with each passing year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important ways that Hyundai and Cisco are making the platform so flexible going forward is by incorporating over-the-air (OTA) updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jeremy Kaplan at &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/hyundai-cisco-in-vehicle-networking/" target="new"&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/a&gt; reports, infotainment systems will be the first element of Hyundai and Cisco's collaborative vehicle to receive OTA updates. Due to their obviously sensitive nature, safety updates will only be deployed once they are 100% effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fact that all electronic devices can hear -- are hearing -- everything we say, and all the devices are able to see us, hear us, and interact with us," Hyundai Design Center EVP Luc Donckerwolke told Kaplan. "We have to think about all that as designer... it's a question we have to address."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next generation of the connected car is dependent upon the forthcoming arrival of 5G connectivity, something that promises to bring far greater speeds to mobile networks. With its platform reportedly capable of handling data transmission speeds of 1 gigabyte per second, Hyundai and Cisco platform are primed to take advantage of the technology as soon as it arrives.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are fewer and fewer things in life these days that go undocumented. With everyone carrying a camera with them at all times thanks to their mobile phones, if something interesting takes place in public view, odds are that that a picture or video will capture the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially true with autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are hard to keep secret. The sheer size of them makes them conspicuous, and there is a lot of interest. A single tweet about an Apple driverless car that was spied on the road created its own minor &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737637" target="new"&gt;news cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One AV company that consistently draws attention is &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;. As a frontrunner in the race to design a fully autonomous vehicle, the company is frequently making news as it achieves various milestones. One area that is closely being watched is Waymo's expansion plans. And in January, news of new urban testing grounds for Waymo came out in ways both intended and unintended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, TechCrunch obtained a photograph suggesting that Waymo was testing in San Francisco. (This was subsequently confirmed by Waymo through a written statement.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the company took things into its own hands by tweeting that it would soon also begin testing in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 12, TechCrunch &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/12/waymos-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-begins-testing-in-san-francisco/" target="new"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a photo of one of Waymo's instantly recognizable self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans operating on the streets of San Francisco. Aside from confirming the previously unannounced development, Waymo did not offer many additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"San Francisco was one of the first cities where we tested our self-driving cars, dating back to 2009 when we traveled everything from Lombard Street to the Golden Gate Bridge," a Waymo spokesperson wrote to TechCrunch. "Now that we have the world's first fleet of fully self-driving cars running in Arizona, the hilly and foggy streets of San Francisco will give our cars even more practice in different terrains and environments."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return to the Bay Area follows Waymo's prominent testing in the Phoenix suburbs, where it is breaking new ground this year by testing self-driving cars that are &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;unaccompanied by human operators&lt;/a&gt;, and launching an autonomous ride-hailing service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt;, one of Waymo's primary competitors, has snidely referenced Waymo's heavy reliance on the relatively calm streets of suburban Arizona as a way of promoting &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=736316" target="new"&gt;Cruise's own intensive testing&lt;/a&gt; on the hectic streets of San Francisco. Now that Waymo is back in SF, the company figures to be immune from such barbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Atlanta news, Waymo didn't wait for news to leak and and revealed the launch of its driverless service with a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Waymo/status/955492529998241792" target="new"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;: "Hello ATL! Metro Atlanta is the next stop for Waymo's test program. Now that we have the world's first fully self-driving vehicles on public roads in AZ, we're looking to take our tech to more cities."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Waymo did not put out a more detailed press release or blog post, Georgia governor Nathan Deal was enthusiastic in discussing the expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With our talented workforce and legacy of innovation, Georgia is at the forefront of the most dynamic, cutting edge industries like autonomous vehicles," Deal &lt;a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/local/gridlock-guy-driverless-cars-may-improve-road-safety/WbKQNSFQrJt7bBJWtUr2aM/" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. "We are thrilled to welcome Waymo to our state because fully self-driving vehicle technology holds tremendous potential to improve road safety, and we are proud Georgia is paving the way for the future of transportation."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The law of unintended consequences holds that in addition to the anticipated results, both positive and negative, any action will also yield results that are completely unforeseen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when self-driving cars become commonplace on our streets, they will likely save lives, save time and make the roads more accessible. They may also be involved in accidents and lead to certain jobs disappearing. Recently, however, one prominent executive raised a possible outcome that few seem to have considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the UK general manager for car-sharing company &lt;a href="http://www.zipcar.com/" target="new"&gt;Zipcar&lt;/a&gt;, Jonathan Hampson knows a thing or two about the streets of London. And when asked about how traffic in the city would change with the proliferation of autonomous vehicles, he brought up an interesting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For autonomous vehicles to work for cities like London they can't be privately owned, it has to be shared ownership," Hampson told &lt;a href="http://www.am-online.com/news/market-insight/2017/07/11/autonomous-cars-should-not-be-privately-owned-says-zipcar" target="new"&gt;Automotive Management Online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Hampson said he feels that private ownership of autonomous vehicles will lead to greater traffic in busy city centers because people will be using the self-driving cars for individuals trips instead of shared ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At first instinct, his proclamation seems curious. If driverless cars are merely replacing our current, human-driven cars, why would the number of cars on the road increase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (theoretical) answer is ironic, in a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are drivers now, riding in a self-driving car represents a more relaxed, convenient experience. In an automated automobile, one would hardly need to interrupt their afternoon workflow to run a quick errand -- heck, one would hardly need to stop eating their lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more convenient the concept of a car ride is, the more people will want to ride and, in turn, the more cars will be on the road, the theory goes. Self-driving cars would also allow newcomers onto roads. The elderly and the disabled would be able to ride in their own vehicles. Perhaps even children could travel to, say, soccer practice by themselves in a car. Looked at in that light, it is by no means unrealistic to predict that AV technology could increase the number of vehicles on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, Hampson believes his company will be able to help solve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Zipcar is the global leader with shared ownership so I think when the time comes we will definitely have a part to play with autonomous vehicles and making them available as part of our fleet," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making car travel convenient for those who don't own their own automobiles, Zipcar is already on the cutting edge. The company has over &lt;a href="http://www.zipcar.com/press/overview" target="new"&gt;1 million members&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, actively operating more 12,000 vehicles in 500-plus cities. Members can rent vehicles at inexpensive by-the-minute rates, picking up and dropping off their cars in "Zipzones."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, the company recently expanded its fleet from 1,500 to 1,800 with &lt;a href="http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/fleet-industry-news/2017/07/10/zipcar-flex-one-way-drive-and-drop-car-club-service-launched-in-london" target="new"&gt;the introduction of its Flex program&lt;/a&gt;. Flex offers users more flexibility, enabling them to make one-way trips within the city, whereas previously they had to return their cars to Zipzones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe that the freedom to be able to do any kind of trip, where you need a car without having to own one, has the power to fundamentally redefine urban mobility in the kind of sustainable way that will allow London to continue to grow and thrive," Hampson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every car Zipcar UK adds to its fleet, 10.5 private automobiles are taken off the road. As the world -- and cities in particular -- grows ever more populous and folks become more conscious of emissions, there's no question that car sharing services will play an important role in the future of car transportation. However, such services will most likely work in conjunction with the ownership of private self-driving cars instead of replacing them entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A look at the agenda for this year's National Governors Association summer meeting in Providence, R.I., reveals that state leaders seem to be particularly concerned with the idea of "innovation." The Microsoft-sponsored Innovation Pavilion hosted exhibitors such as AT&amp;T, Intel and Raytheon, as well as a press event entitled "States: The Intersection of Collaboration and Innovation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even breakfast, on one day of the itinerary, was referred to as "Wake Up and Smell the Innovation." It's fitting, then, that the conference's closing plenary session would host one of the world's leading innovators, Tesla's Elon Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/9/11892936/elon-musk-pentagon-visit-flying-metal-suit" target="new"&gt;The real-life Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt; had plenty to say to the nation's governors on July 15, when he helped introduce Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe and Nevada governor Brian Sandoval as the new chair and vice chair, respectively, of the association, according to the Verge.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk spoke to 30 governors on the excitement surrounding the emergence of electric and autonomous vehicles, as well as concerns that need to be addressed with regards to artificial intelligence and connected car technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Musk is bullish on autonomous vehicle tech, believing it will reduce human-driven cars to hobby objects in a mere two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fully autonomous. There will not be a steering wheel. Twenty years? It will be like having a horse," &lt;a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/34231-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-regular-cars-will-be-like-horses-in-20-years" target="new"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt;. "People have horses, which is cool. There will be people who have non-autonomous cars, like people have horses. It would just be unusual to use that as a mode of transport."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's equally as excited about electric cars, which he sees becoming the norm and not the outlier in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In ten years half of all production will be EV," he said. "I think almost all cars produced will be autonomous in ten years, almost all. It will be rare to find one that is not, in ten years. That's going to be a huge transformation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there's more than a little self interest in these prognostications for Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is a leader in &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/07/17/tesla-model-3/471938001/" target="new"&gt;electric cars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-enhanced-autopilot-system-self-driving-features-2017-6" target="new"&gt;self-driving ones&lt;/a&gt;. Musk has, however, been consistently frank in addressing the worries that the prospect of an autonomous vehicle future can incite. Specifically, he spoke to the governors about the possibility of someone hacking connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We gotta make super sure that a fleet-wide [hack] is basically impossible and that if people are in the car, that they have override authority on whatever the car is doing, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2017/07/17/tesla-fleet-hack-elon-musk/" target="new"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. "If the car is doing something wacky, you can press a button that no amount of software can override and ensure that you gain control of the vehicle and cut the link to the servers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk also expressed his belief that the regulation of artificial intelligence could literally be life-or-death going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AI is the rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive. Because I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it'll be too late," &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/17/elon-musk-regulation-ai-combat-existential-threat-tesla-spacex-ceo" target="new"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. "AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any number of sci-fi thrillers, it's the over-zealousness and reckless abandon of a tech genius that endangers society. The fact that an industry thought leader like Musk is being as cautious as he is may be the best reason to believe that his fears won't become reality.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to awareness of companies that are leading the charge toward the future of autonomous vehicles, people in the US tend to be most familiar with Silicon Valley firms such as Waymo or Uber, or products being developed by legacy automakers such as Ford or Audi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any Americans know of Baidu at all, it's probably because of the tech giant's dominance as a search engine -- the company is often referred to as the &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=652"target="new"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; of China. Those who are interested in autonomous vehicles, though, should get to know Baidu because it's emerging as a global leader in the self-driving car sector due to its innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That status was further cemented earlier this month, when Baidu announced that &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=723"target="new"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; would become a major contributor to Baidu's Apollo platform. This "Apollo program" refers to an autonomous vehicle platform that addresses the major functionalities of self-driving cars: perception of surroundings and route planning, among others. Microsoft joins a list of partners for Baidu's Apollo that has grown to over 50 and includes heavy hitters such as Daimler, Ford, Bosch, Nvidia and ZF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[Apollo] has gained a lot of momentum since April and we have gained a lot of partners around the world. ... two thirds from within China, one third from outside of China," Ya-Qin Zhang, Baidu's president of technology, emerging business and global business operations, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/07/18/baidus-apollo-lifts-off-microsoft-taking-open-source-robocar-project-global/#6f1c92d86073" target="new"&gt;told Forbes&lt;/a&gt;. "We want to extend this to the world and believe this whole technology can be shared by China, and that's why we partnered with Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most interesting thing about Apollo is its status as an open source platform, meaning that any third party can contribute to it, not just official partners of Baidu. Being open source means that manufacturers can easily incorporate their own existing systems and technologies into it. Baidu, however, is not being cavalier with the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We will make sure this moves very fast and very efficiently, but also is inclusive and open," said Zhang. "We want to make sure all the contributions are high quality. The more data they put in, the more software they put in, there's exponentially more they actually can get back."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, the new partnership with Baidu is a natural continuation of the approach Redmond has taken towards autonomous vehicles. Unlike other tech giants, the software giant is not attempting to manufacture its own cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're not in a position to deliver [self-driving cars] end-to-end," Microsoft Corporate Vice President Kevin Dallas &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-baidu-apollo-self-driving-cars-2017-7" target="new"&gt;told Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not to say that Microsoft isn't heavily involved in the AV space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In fact, the company has become somewhat of a leader in developing the software and technologies needed to power these vehicles. In 2015, &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/20/microsoft-volvo-strike-deal-to-make-driverless-cars.html" target="new"&gt;it struck a deal with Volvo&lt;/a&gt; to work on technology to power the Swedish automaker's cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Baidu and Apollo, Microsoft will bring a level of security and artificial intelligence that are unparalleled on the platform. Perhaps most valuably, the Apollo platform &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170718/MOBILITY/170719725/chinas-baidu-taps-microsoft-to-extend-autonomous-reach" target="new"&gt;will now be able to utilize Azure&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft's public cloud platform. Azure will enable Apollo and the products that are built upon it to easily access, for example, digital maps that self-driving cars need to navigate themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering its own size and stature, along with the partners it already had in shaping Apollo, Baidu hardly needed further legitimization as a serious contender in the self-driving car market. Microsoft, though, immediately becomes the biggest name associated with the Baidu project, and that clout -- not to mention the substantial technological resources that come with it -- ought to help Baidu immensely going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If ride-sharing is not the single most significant automotive trend of this decade, it's certainly in the discussion. Many people order the ride that serves as their morning commute on a smartphone app every morning, hundreds of thousands are participating in the gig economy as drivers and "Uber" has become just as much of a verb as "Google."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyft, as Uber's main competitor, is a titan in the ride-sharing space and is therefore a very of-the-moment company. As the company recently announced, however, Lyft is just as concerned with the future as it is the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;  recently announced that it has signed a lease on a 50,000-square foot space in Palo Alto, Calif., which the company will use to develop new self-driving car technology. They have plans to hire hundreds of employees by the end of next year to help run the new division, but, according to Vice President of Autonomous Technology Luc Vincent, Lyft has already been devoting a large portion of its operations to the project for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We aren't thinking of our self-driving division as a side project. It's core to our business," &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/technology/lyft-self-driving-car-technology.html?mcubz=0" target="new"&gt;Vincent told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. "That's why 10 percent of our engineers are already focused on developing self-driving technology -- and we'll continue to grow that team in the months ahead."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the extent of Lyft's ambitions are unclear -- for example, it's unknown if the company is designing its own self-driving car -- one project is certain: an open-platform software that will leverage the data from the company's current ride-share operations to inform autonomous vehicle systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With Lyft's open platform, the world's best car manufacturers and self-driving systems can plug into our network of nearly one million rides per day," &lt;a href="https://take.lyft.com/open-platform/" target="new"&gt;the company noted on its website&lt;/a&gt;. "Access to a diverse set of real-life scenarios helps partners develop their systems around actual experiences and behaviors. Smart dispatching ensures the right vehicle is always dispatched for the right routes and conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of an open platform reads as a savvy move for Lyft. With Uber operating alone in developing self-driving cars and competing directly with automakers, Lyft becomes the only major ride-sharing company willing to share its data with other developers. Through that lens, its data, already an incredibly hot commodity, becomes even more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want to bring the whole industry together with this, and we think there's a unique opportunity in time right now for Lyft to become a leader while doing it," said Chief Strategy Officer Raj Kapoor at an event announcing the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Lyft has spent a significant amount of time operating in Uber's shadow, and, not surprisingly, a number of headlines have positioned Lyft's latest announcement as yet another "challenge" to Uber. Thanks to several missteps by Uber in recent months, as well as savvy operating by Lyft in the same timeframe, the gap between the two companies has decreased. &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/07/19/uber-vs-lyft-race/" target="new"&gt;According to Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, Lyft's market share in ride-sharing has increased from 21% to 25% since February alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a broader sense, Lyft's development of self-driving technology is yet another domino to fall, as it now becomes difficult to name a major company in the automotive sector that isn't involved in the development of autonomous vehicles in some form. The more crowded the AV development landscape becomes, the more of a certainty an AV future becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The potential for self-driving cars to make roads safer is immense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some estimates that autonomous vehicles will reduce &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/self-driving-cars-could-save-300000-lives-per-decade-in-america/407956/"target="new"&gt;traffic deaths&lt;/a&gt; by as much as 90%. Given the chance to reduce loss of life, it's hard to argue that self-driving cars shouldn't be developed and deployed as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a deeper level of thinking complicates this logic. For example, the lives lost in self-driving car trials may pale in comparison to the lives they ultimately save, but that doesn't make it acceptable for deaths to occur during trials. Plus, there are those who are skeptical of self-driving cars' ability to bring about the safety benefits that have been promised. It's a challenging ethical dilemma that currently lacks a dominant framework to address it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you find Carnegie Mellon philosophy professors Alex John London and David Danks to be persuasive, that framework may already exist, albeit in a different industry. In an opinion piece published in IEEE Intelligent Systems titled "&lt;a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7851147/" target="new"&gt;Regulating Autonomous Systems: Beyond Standards&lt;/a&gt;," the pair presented a compelling argument that autonomous vehicles ought to be regulated in the way that the US Food and Drug Administration tests drugs before approving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for such regulation, according to Dank, involves concerns of both safety and practicality. If early self-driving car technology performs poorly and endangers human drivers, it could hamper automakers' long-term ability to get their autonomous vehicles on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the case of drugs, we have pretty well established procedures for looking at, for example, when a drug has more negative side effects than anticipated," Dank &lt;a href="http://jalopnik.com/ethics-expert-wants-self-driving-cars-approved-like-new-1797106098" target="new"&gt;told Jalopnik&lt;/a&gt;. "There's a great risk if [driverless cars] are put on the road before we understand better how they're going to behave, there will be a number of accidents that will set back the possibility of these things being regulated in the right way."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process Danks and London describe mirrors that of drug approval. "Preclinical trials" for self-driving cars would place them in various environments, record how they respond, and adjust their technology accordingly. The next step would be human-assisted voyages in which autonomous vehicles navigate roadways with a person acting as co-pilot. As these processes and more were completed successfully, regulations would allow for further integration of AVs into normal, everyday operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument can be made, however, that the horse(power) is out of the barn. Self-driving cars are already testing on roads by the thousands, and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734769" target="new"&gt;legislation currently making its way through the House&lt;/a&gt; would put tens of thousands more out in traffic. But Danks and London do suggest an approach and philosophy to new technology that can guide our actions going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Autonomous vehicles have the potential to save lives and increase economic productivity," &lt;a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/february/driverless-car-regulations.html" target="new"&gt;said London&lt;/a&gt;. "But these benefits won't be realized unless the public has credible assurance that such systems are safe and reliable."&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V) is an interesting and unique segment of the connected car market. Most news in the category centers around OEMs and technology companies trying to show that their offerings are superior and worthy of adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, V2V is more platform-agnostic. It is built to play nicely with other technology, regardless of make or model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, for V2V to be successful, there need to be a lot of vehicles talking -- and listening -- to other vehicles. If only one car on the road has V2V capability, it can be a little like a tree falling in the woods. But if many cars have V2V, the potential for them to relay crucial information between each other is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vw.com/" target="new"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; is doing its part to make sure more cars are equipped with the technology. In 2019, VW will begin &lt;a href="http://www.thedrive.com/tech/11920/volkswagen-jumps-on-the-v2v-bandwagon-plans-to-launch-system-in-2019" target="new"&gt;selling cars outfitted with V2V technology&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the first OEMs to introduce V2V to standard consumer vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, the usefulness of this will be limited at launch, as there won't be many other vehicles for the V2V-equipped VWs to communicate with. But over time, the utility of the technology will grow. Imagine a scenario where one car detects black ice with its own sensors and then transmits a notification of the location of the black ice to other V2V-equipped vehicles or to municipal safety workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will also be more immediate applications, mostly in the form of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) features. Most of these involve safety, which is always a concern with connected cars. The new Volkswagens will be warned of upcoming traffic hazards like accidents or construction sites, and the German automaker hopes to reach agreements with emergency services to help warn cars and drivers when ambulances or firetrucks are approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen is not the first automaker to introduce V2V to its vehicles: &lt;a href="http://www.cadillac.com/" target="new"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt; announced in March that its 2017 CTS sedans would come standard with V2V technology, describing similar safety features to the ones touted by Volkswagen. &lt;a href="http://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2017/mar/0309-v2v.html" target="new"&gt;In its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, however, Cadillac acknowledged that many of the uses for the tech were still to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As an early mover, we look forward to seeing its benefit multiply as more V2V-equipped vehicles hit the road," said Cadillac Global Director of Product Strategy Richard Brekus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes being the forerunner of an early technology can have its drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A company could do all the heavy initial lifting, only to have others come in and reap the rewards. But being an early leader in the V2V space also gives automakers like Cadillac and Volkswagen early access to data, so they can see what is and is not working and act accordingly. Their actions can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If other automakers see what Cadillac and VW are doing, they may follow suit for fear of being left out, the effect of which would be more V2V-equipped cars on the roads. That would make the early adopters look particularly prescient.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Elon Musk had plenty to say when he addressed the National Governors Association summer meeting in Rhode Island in July. Musk predicted that in 20 years owning a non-autonomous vehicle would be the equivalent of owning a horse today -- a luxury reserved for hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tesla founder also prophesied that electric vehicles will account for half of all automobile production in ten years. But Musk's vision of the future wasn't all rosy. He also shared serious concerns surrounding the security of self-driving car software in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We gotta make super sure that a fleet-wide [hack] is basically impossible and that if people are in the car, that they have override authority on whatever the car is doing," &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734721" target="new"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt;. "If the car is doing something wacky, you can press a button that no amount of software can override and ensure that you gain control of the vehicle and cut the link to the servers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk's concern is shared by many in the industry and has led to numerous efforts designed to increase cybersecurity in connected cars. The latest product is a gigabit Ethernet switch from &lt;a href="https://www.marvell.com/" target="new"&gt;Marvell&lt;/a&gt;, a product specifically designed to &lt;a href="https://tiresandparts.net/news/parts/marvell-debuts-car-ethernet-switch-increase-security-connected-cars/" target="new"&gt;secure and protect data transmissions&lt;/a&gt; to and from connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As connected cars become more autonomous and the demand for greater data volume and mobility continues to rise, vehicles are also becoming increasingly vulnerable to security breaches and new types of cyberattacks," &lt;a href="http://www.marvell.com/company/news/pressDetail.do?releaseID=9276" target="new"&gt; Ian Riches&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Automotive Practices at &lt;a href="https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/home#.WXuAxCMrJhE" target="_blank"&gt;Strategy Analytics&lt;/a&gt; wrote. "Marvell's new generation of secure automotive gigabit Ethernet switches constitute a secure hardware foundation for connected cars that will help safeguard the intelligent infrastructures with advanced security features against next level cybercrimes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ethernet switch is the first of its kind designed for connected cars. It uses a deep packet inspection (DPI) engine, a data filtering tool that can intercept corrupted or compromised data before it reaches its destination. It also supports blacklisting and whitelisting addresses on all of its Ethernet ports. The switch is compliant with &lt;a href="http://www.ieee802.org/3/bp/" target="new"&gt;IEEE802.3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ieee802.org/1/" target="new"&gt;802.1&lt;/a&gt; standards and is &lt;a href="http://www.aecouncil.com/Documents/AEC_Q100_Rev_G_Base_Document.pdf" target="new"&gt;AEC-Q100&lt;/a&gt; qualified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marvell's new automotive Ethernet switch is one of many solutions that various companies have proposed to enhance connected car security. Many believe that &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/351486/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-wor" target="new"&gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt; is the key for the vehicles of tomorrow safely completing monetary transactions such as paying for gas. "Leveraging its decentralization paradigm, blockchain technology has the potential to solve many trust requirements that today burden a large number of business processes and interactions," &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/consumer-industrial-products/Blockchain_AutomotiveFinance.pdf?ReillyBrennanFoT" target="new"&gt;a recent report from Deloitte&lt;/a&gt; stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/video.asp?section_id=629&amp;doc_id=734856" target="new"&gt;a video for The Connected Car&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://irdeto.com/" target="new"&gt;Irdeto&lt;/a&gt; chief security architect Stacy Janes used a driving simulator to demonstrate how the cybersecurity company's technology would deal with a cyberattack on a connected car. "The attack gets detected, the attack gets stopped, and a telemetry of it gets sent to the OEM saying that this vehicle is being tampered with," described Janes. "We heal the code and prevent the attack, and then we notify the OEM what's going on."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every imaginable functionality for the connected car of tomorrow -- and there are many -- comes with its own set of theoretical security concerns. Fittingly, a wide variety of security products for different elements of the connected car are being developed. One of the most essential elements for consumer adoption of new technology is trust, and these products will serve to help build that trust for connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;You don't need a doctorate in etymology to understand what the startup Tesloop is all about. The operation involves Tesla cars that travel in loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Tesloop offers rides back and forth from various cities that are "looped" together. With service currently centered around California, Tesloop routes include Los Angeles-San Diego and Orange County-Palm Springs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tesloop is similar to a plane, train or bus, taking the best aspects of each and wrapping it into a unique experience," according to the company's &lt;a href="https://tesloop.com/" target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. "It is great for those traveling daily long distance commutes, the business traveler trying to get to LAX or for those reconnecting with family and friends. You can finally relax and stay productive when travelling while enjoying complimentary amenities such as wifi, device chargers, healthy snacks and drinks, travel pillows and headphones."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's teen-aged founder, Haydn Sonnad, started the company a couple of years ago, after presenting the idea to Elon Musk and subsequently receiving seed money from Clearstone Ventures, as well as angel investments from Facebook and Tesla itself. Since then, Tesloop has grown quickly into a legitimate operation with &lt;a href="http://www.tesloop.com/team/" target="new"&gt;a formidable executive team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest news since the company's inception came early in September, when &lt;a href="https://www.goodyear.com/" target="new"&gt;Goodyear&lt;/a&gt; announced that it would outfit the Tesloop fleet with tires that come equipped with wireless sensors. The sensors will provide valuable information to Goodyear about fleet usage patterns and the performance of its own tires, while giving Tesloop data that will make tire management more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want to build the future, not just observe or read about it," Goodyear CTO Chris Helsel wrote &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/goodyear-announces-intelligent-tire-trial-expands-fleet-management-solution-for-semi-autonomous-fleet-300516252.html" target="new"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "As the new mobility ecosystem continues to take shape, we are taking steps to match the pace of technical change in the transportation industry and develop tire innovations that meet the intelligence of the vehicles riding on them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While taking care of tires might seem like a minor ordeal for the owner of an individual consumer vehicle, it can become a large-scale concern for fleet owners like Tesloop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Tesloop, the goal of the Goodyear partnership is to minimize those concerns to the greatest degree possible. The embedded sensors will deliver vehicle data that -- using Goodyear's proprietary algorithms -- will predict when tires need servicing or replacement. This will reduce costs and the amount of time that Tesloop vehicles need to spend in the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When you are operating cars nearly 24/7/365, minimizing tire incidents is critical to the customer experience and the business model," Tesloop CEO Rahul Sonnad noted. "The possibilities for data-driven tire diagnostics are remarkable and promise to help a business like Tesloop operate more efficiently and make our vehicles the safest on the road."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Goodyear, Tesloop finds a partner with a long-standing automotive legacy that lends legitimacy to its still-young operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodyear, meanwhile, has a partner on the cutting edge of perhaps the two foremost emerging movements in automobiles: fleet management and autonomous driving. It's a merging of the old and the new, and it's indisputably a win-win partnership.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, autonomous vehicle hardware lags behind autonomous vehicle software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given adequate input, the computer systems that power self-driving cars are already incredibly effective at safely and efficiently navigating traffic, even when it comes to navigating around accidents or unexpected driver behavior in other vehicles. However, in order to work, these systems need a comprehensive understanding of what's going on in their immediate surroundings, and that's where the hardware comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various forms of sensors, including radar, laser and cameras are able to paint a picture that computers can then use to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Certain types of sensors, however, are necessarily less effective in certain conditions, including low lighting and adverse weather. Since a driver isn't only going to use their car when it's sunny out, overcoming these hurdles is a major challenge for autonomous vehicle developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One company believes it has found a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adasky.com/" target="new"&gt;AdaSky&lt;/a&gt;, an Israeli startup with a team comprising engineers experienced in semiconductors and sensors, has introduced a product known as the Viper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The showpiece of the Viper system is a Far Infrared (FIR) thermal camera. By detecting the thermal energy of surrounding objects, these cameras can provide the same sort of raw data for environmental perception that, say, radar or &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;Lidar&lt;/a&gt; can. Viper also includes algorithms that interpret this data, effectively building a three-dimensional map from which a self-driving car can operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what really makes the Viper's thermal sensors stand out is that they are unaffected by the inclement weather and lighting situations that can render other sensors useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We saw a powerful opportunity in the market," &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/adasky-launches-thermal-fir-sensing-solution-to-give-vehicles-247-vision-accelerates-fully-autonomous-driving-300516958.html" target="new"&gt; Avi Katz&lt;/a&gt;, founder and president and CEO of AdaSky, wrote in a statement. "The most basic need for an autonomous vehicle is to be able to see and interpret what is happening around it, regardless of road conditions. Existing sensors and cameras available today can't meet this need on their own. To address this, we turned to FIR technology, which has been proven in other vertical industries and is mature enough to scale. We adapted the technology for the automotive industry and have been able to create a solution that performs at its best in use cases where other sensors fail."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same statement, AdaSky notes that the Viper is meant to be used as a supplementary technology to existing sensor systems, whether it be radar, Lidar, cameras or some combination of the three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Viper is the first high-resolution, thermal camera for autonomous vehicles with minimal size, weight and power consumption and no moving parts -- at a price suited for mass market," according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than an autonomous system unto itself, AdaSky is positioning Viper as a component of a larger AV architecture. If successful, however, it will be a critical component indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Feedback from testing has reflected that thermal sensing, in combination with the other sensors, can greatly improve general object, pedestrian, and animal detection," said Dror Meiri, vice president of business development at AdaSky. "Our FIR technology enables perception even beyond what evaluators initially thought possible. The time for FIR in the automotive industry is now. The technology is designed for scalability and automotive OEMs and new entrants know that to reach their vision of the fully-autonomous vehicle they need to achieve higher levels of perception and sight. Our camera and computer vision algorithms, trained by large amounts of annotated data that we've collected, will empower the car of the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With competition in the AV sensor market heating up with each passing month, AdaSky seems wise to position its technology as complementary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A startup pushing new technology and looking to get it in front of larger companies is smart to come in with a collaborative, rather than a competitive, approach. And if Viper is as effective as the company claims in handling bad weather, the company will be in a competitive position regardless.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;We hear a lot about "big data" these days, often in vague terms. But here's a straightforward statement that simplifies things a bit: Any user data that can be recorded &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it's recorded, someone will be using it, and most likely using it to sell you something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to help marketers gather and interpret that data represents a huge opportunity in the overall business landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late June, Adobe announced that its Analytics Cloud product could now analyze and leverage the data collected from voice-enabled devices and digital assistants. If you kept asking Amazon's Alexa to play Katy Perry songs, for example, Adobe could then potentially let a company like Ticketmaster know when Perry was touring in your area and offer a deal on tickets to the concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may sound a little Orwellian at first, but it's all in the name of improving customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Adobe isn't just focused on digital assistants in the home. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="new"&gt;the company&lt;/a&gt; expanded its reach in the data space even further by announcing that Adobe Experience Cloud was opening up new capabilities in analytics, experience personalization and customized advertising, all geared toward connected vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how vehicle passengers represent a captive audience, the connected car has long represented something of a holy grail for advertisers looking to add to the connected in-car experience. With the new services from Adobe Experience Cloud, the opportunities for more personalized services, and the new revenue streams that come from them, broaden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In the automotive industry, in-car digital services are opening up new revenue sources and pushing brands to become true experience businesses," Amit Ahuja, vice president of Emerging Businesses at Adobe Experience Cloud, noted &lt;a href="http://news.adobe.com/press-release/experience-cloud/media-alert-adobe-transforms-car-experiences-through-data-driven" target="new"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "With consumer expectations at an all-time high, content has to be informed with data insights to satisfy individual preferences. As car rides transform into immersive, personalized digital experiences, Adobe gives brands the tools to be exceptional no matter where they engage the customer."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adobe listed three main capabilities presented by the additions to Experience Cloud: "Understanding Drive Time Behavior," "Delivering Personalized In-Car Content" and "Serving Targeted Audio Ads."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first refers to capturing how drivers interact with their car's system, such as how frequently they use voice command versus touch screen functions. This data can help OEMs improve both the user experience overall as well the experience for individual users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personalized content aspect goes far beyond making music suggestions based on your favorite artists. "A car maker could deliver a tailored audio message for a new and customized lease offer," according to Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making inferences drawn from user behavior across various channels, Adobe Advertising Cloud can serve targeted ads in a more engaging and efficient way than they have traditionally been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the opportunities for data-driven services in connected cars are numerous, they can also be seen as a warmup for the arrival of self-driving cars. If you think drivers are a captive audience for targeted ads in connected cars, currently, just imagine how attentive they'll be when they don't need to bother paying attention to the road.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In newer vehicles, automated safety features make getting behind the wheel safer than ever. Some cars now provide an alert when the vehicle drifts out of its lane or if another car is driving up in a blind spot. The services do a good job of making drivers more aware of their surroundings and forcing them to pay more attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they are not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, it can be annoying to hear a beeping alert if you're just moving slightly out of your lane to allow a little extra room while passing a cyclist. The services also do not currently prevent one of the most dangerous behaviors: texting while driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a new system is in development at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. At &lt;a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/" target="new"&gt;Waterloo Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, researchers are working on artificial intelligence-powered computer algorithms which, in conjunction with in-car cameras, can detect when drivers are engaging in distracted driving activities like texting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project comes out of the university's &lt;a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-pattern-analysis-machine-intelligence/" target="new"&gt;Centre for Pattern Analysis &amp; Machine Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (CPAMI), which conducts research in six areas: Machine perception, robotics and autonomous systems, cooperative intelligent systems, human-machine interaction, pattern recognition and image analysis, and data mining and knowledge discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"CPAMI's findings will have the potential to address numerous real world problems that traditional systems cannot resolve," reads the Centre's &lt;a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-pattern-analysis-machine-intelligence/research-areas" target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. "The envisaged application directions include, but are not limited to, public security, manufacturing, transportation, assistive environments for seniors and people with disabilities, communication, eLearning, finance and web services."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver distraction detection software incorporates previous research that centered around signs that a person may be at risk of falling asleep, including certain blinking patterns, positioning of the head, and facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other actions that are a little easier for the technology to detect, like texting or reaching into the backseat, are analyzed based on duration to determine whether the driver needs to be warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, while briefly glancing at your cell phone may be ill-advised while driving, it likely wouldn't garner an alert from the system. Taking the time to send a text message, however, probably would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As autonomous vehicles become a more integral part of our transportation systems and come to represent a greater percentage of cars on the road, the researchers see their safety system working in tandem with autonomous systems to help drivers avoid collisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The car could actually take over driving if there was imminent danger, even for a short while, in order to avoid crashes," &lt;a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/new-software-can-detect-when-people-text-and-drive" target="new"&gt;noted Fakhri Karray&lt;/a&gt;, director at CPAMI and a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While plenty of media attention gets placed on the research and development of AV and AI safety systems done by automakers and software companies, it's nice to see similar work being done by an institution of higher learning, whose interest is more focused on the public good rather than the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the more groups that are working on vehicular safety -- and the greater the diversity of perspectives involved -- the faster we'll see more effective technology on the market.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Many industrial cities throughout the central US have a challenging time attracting college graduates with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lure of coastal cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco is tough to resist. Trendy music, food, and cultural scenes have a great appeal to recent grads. More important, however, than the "after hours" opportunities are the "during hours" ones. To a large degree, NYC, LA and SF are where the jobs are and that is going to have the greatest effect on a recent graduate's decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one industrial capital, Pittsburgh, is doing its best to edge in on its coastal competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the hubs for the fast-growing autonomous vehicle sector and home to one of the country's most prestigious STEM universities, Pittsburgh is becoming a more attractive option for graduates who want to work in the game-changing field. A &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/16/pittsburghs-self-driving-car-boom-means-200000-pay-packages-for-robotics-grads.html" target="new"&gt;CNBC report&lt;/a&gt; recently described how graduates from Carnegie Mellon University's computer vision program (and elsewhere) are entering the workforce in the city with starting salaries reaching $200,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Pittsburgh has become the de facto capital for self-driving car development, thanks to Carnegie Mellon's top-ranked robotics program and the city's openness to partnering with tech companies on risky endeavors," reporter Ari Levy writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four companies are working exclusively on self-driving cars in the city: Uber, Argo AI, Aurora Innovation and a fourth that is still in stealth mode, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a look at the three companies openly working on AV tech in the Steel City to see how they are helping reinvigorate Pittsburgh:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/pittsburgh/self-driving-ubers/" target="new"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is Pittsburgh's longest-tenured AV resident, having struck a partnership with Carnegie Mellon &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/uber-teams-carnegie-mellon-self-driving-car-research-n298896" target="new"&gt;in early 2015&lt;/a&gt; to establish a research facility in the city to explore all aspects of self-driving technology. Soon after, it came to light that the company had hired some 50 employees who previously worked at CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center. Some suggested that the primary goal of the partnership was "&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/5/19/8622831/uber-self-driving-cars-carnegie-mellon-poached" target="new"&gt;poaching&lt;/a&gt;" talent. In September 2016, Uber launched a self-driving car service in Pittsburgh, an arrangement that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/technology/pittsburgh-ubers-driverless-car-experiment.html?mcubz=3&amp;amp;_r=0" target="new"&gt;quickly went sour&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, Uber is still alive and active in the city, easily representing its largest employer of AV technicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.argo.ai/" target="new"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Argo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an artificial intelligence firm that focuses specifically on driverless cars that are headquartered in Pittsburgh's Strip District. The company made waves last February, when Ford revealed that it had made &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/ford-invests-in-pittsburgh-based-argo-ai-to-build-self-driving-cars-by-2021/" target="new"&gt;a $1 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; in Argo with the aim of producing fully autonomous vehicles by 2021. For Argo, it's an essential partnership: AV startups are faced with something of a low ceiling for their operations until they have access to an automaker to help produce and scale their product. For Ford, the enormous size of its investment is a testament to Argo's technology and a symbol of the Blue Oval's commitment to becoming a leader in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aurora.tech/" target="new"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aurora&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the newest player in the Steel City's AV scene. The company only came out of stealth mode &lt;a href="http://triblive.com/local/allegheny/12256468-74/aurora-innovation-joins-pittsburghs-self-driving-car-ecosystem" target="new"&gt;earlier this summer&lt;/a&gt;. Its founders bring big-name pedigree: Sterling Anderson was once director of Autopilot at Tesla, Chris Urmson was CTO at what is now known as Waymo, and Drew Bagnell was head of autonomy right down the road at Uber. As one of its first public acts, Aurora went for symbolism -- its self-driving 2017 Audi Q7 journeyed from Silicon Valley to Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the AV sector isn't leaving Silicon Valley anytime soon, it's clear this doesn't have to be an either/or scenario. The industry is big enough to have multiple homes. And as these three firms show, Pittsburgh has certainly established itself as one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Here's a familiar scenario: It's time for family dinner, and everyone is sitting in their usual places around the table. You ask the kids what they did at school; they reply with their typical mumbled non-responses. They ask you to pass the potatoes, and you gently remind them to ask for the potatoes &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a typical meal, with one minor exception: Instead of sitting around the dining table in the living room of your house, you are in a self-driving car that is piloting you back from your kids' soccer practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be tough to imagine that taking place today, but steps are already being taken toward a future that looks like that. It was recently revealed that &lt;a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="news"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; has filed a new patent for a table that would be situated in the middle of an autonomous vehicle and surrounded by a set of inward-facing seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The autonomous vehicle may include seats free to rotate during operation of the vehicle," reads the background section of &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/assets/PDF/CA112137918.PDF" target="new"&gt;the patent&lt;/a&gt;, which is entitled "Vehicle Table with Deployable Airbag."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This may allow the occupants of the seats to face each other and to interact. This may also allow all of the occupants to relax, interact with one another, and focus on vehicle amenities. There remains an opportunity to design vehicle amenities for the occupants that takes into account the reduced operation monitoring provided by the autonomous vehicle," according to the patent filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your greatest fear is having to sit facing your family members or commuting partners for an extended car ride, fear not: The patent also offers multiple proposals for how the seats could be configured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The seats may be mounted to the floor in a fixed position and... may be rotatable about the fixed position in a cross-vehicle direction and a vehicle fore-and-after direction," reads the patent. "Alternatively, the seats may be movable relative to the floor."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patent pays a lot of attention to the specifics of the airbag that would be installed within the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fitting, since it appears to be one of the most well-developed concepts we've seen for a product of this type. That said, it allows for plenty of possibilities as well. The patent gets into details with a high amount of specificity, including potential airbag materials. (If you were wondering, they include polyether ether ketone, polyetherketoneketone, polyester, or "any other suitable polymer.")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ford had little to say on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We submit patents on innovative ideas as a normal course of business," a Ford spokesman &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170918/MOBILITY/170919716/ford-patents-retractable-table-for-autonomous-cars" target="new"&gt;told Automotive News&lt;/a&gt; in an email. "Patent applications are intended to protect new ideas but aren't necessarily an indication of new business or product plans."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That perspective is important, especially considering that the uncertainty with regards to the designs of future autonomous vehicles means that planning for them is inherently quite speculative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative to other patents, though -- including Ford's &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735605" target="new"&gt;removable steering wheel concept&lt;/a&gt; -- this table seems quite likely. When people aren't driving in their cars, they'll inevitably be doing &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734361" target="new"&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And surely some of those activities will require a table. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If you had never heard anything about autonomous vehicles and were guessing who was working in the space, it would be easy to round up a group of usual suspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd probably reason that major automakers -- GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler -- were investing heavily in the technology that could reshape the future of mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd also probably guess that major software companies such as Google, Intel and Nvidia were involved because of their industry-leading technology in related fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might even think that Apple had something up its sleeve (which would have been correct up until &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/technology/apple-self-driving-car.html?mcubz=1" target="new"&gt;a couple months ago&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are some companies you'd be completely surprised to hear had designs on the AV space, and &lt;a href="https://us.blackberry.com/" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best known for the cellphones it made that were ubiquitous a decade ago before being eclipsed by devices from Apple and Samsung, BlackBerry has since pivoted to focus a large portion of its business on designing software. To that end, BlackBerry recently announced that it would team up with &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/" target="new"&gt;Delphi Automotive&lt;/a&gt; to provide its QNX OS for Safety to support Delphi's platform for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is no safety without security," John Wall, senior vice president and general manager of BlackBerry QNX, &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-teams-with-BlackBerry-QNX-for-autonomous-driving-operating-system-platform" target="new"&gt;noted in a joint announcement&lt;/a&gt;. "With cyberattacks and threats to connected vehicles on the rise, it is imperative that auto manufacturers are provided with software that is safety certified, reliable and secure. This is an area in which BlackBerry QNX excels, and we look forward to the new opportunities this expansion with Delphi will bring."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific product that BlackBerry's technology will be supplementing is called Centralized Sensing Localization and Planning (CSLP), a "fully integrated automated driving solution" that Delphi plans to release in 2019. Delphi is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735698" target="new"&gt;well-known partnership&lt;/a&gt; to develop an autonomous platform that also involves BMW, Intel and Fiat-Chrysler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not addressed whether BlackBerry QNX will be involved with the work of that consortium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"BlackBerry QNX will provide a robust software infrastructure for CSLP and help advance Delphi's autonomous driving system," noted Glen De Vos, senior vice president and chief technology officer at Delphi. "Safety in high performance computing systems is paramount to a production ready autonomous driving solution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Vos recently spoke strongly about the need for the automotive industry to rethink the physical architecture of cars. As vehicle technology has evolved, an increasing number of electronic control units (ECUs) have accompanied a corresponding number of new systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Vos believes the ECUs need to be consolidated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have to move the car from an appliance to a device," &lt;a href="http://wardsauto.com/technology/delphi-industry-must-go-digital-or-die" target="new"&gt;De Vos said&lt;/a&gt;. "The problem has been solved before. The question is how to do it for automotive."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That specific issue does not appear to be part of Delphi's partnership with BlackBerry, but it may speak to the type of platform it is developing and the kinds of vehicles it can live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicles require a number of different systems and certain redundancies need to be in place to ensure their safe operation. Nevertheless, efficiencies need to be found. If the solution is to simply keep adding on more modules, AVs will become unwieldy. And that's bad news for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In the 2008 Pixar film &lt;em&gt;Wall-E&lt;/em&gt;, the character Eve is a robot that is sent to a destroyed and trash-covered planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the main character Wall-E, Eve discovers life in the form of a plant, which she brings back to a space colony of humans who have relocated from the planet they destroyed. Robotic hijinks ensue and, by the end of the film, the human race has reinhabited Earth with the plant that Eve discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-driving startup &lt;a href="http://www.aeva.ai/" target="new"&gt;Aeva&lt;/a&gt;'s name was inspired by the Pixar character, and the company has a mission that's similarly futuristic. Aeva is designing a new sensor that merges the detection and velocity-measuring capabilities of the numerous sensor suites that are currently used by most self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aeva made a splash in the autonomous vehicle world in September when it was featured in an extensive &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/technology/former-apple-engineers-driverless-cars.html" target="new"&gt;New York Times profile&lt;/a&gt;. The company was founded by Souroush Salehian and Mina Rezk, each of whom worked at Apple's Special Projects Group. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/technology/apple-self-driving-car.html" target="new"&gt;The demise&lt;/a&gt; of Apple's attempts to build a self-driving car, which would have fallen under the Special Projects Group, has been widely reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it's never explicitly stated, it's a safe bet that both Salehian and Rezk were involved on that specific project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At their new venture, the pair is looking to tackle perhaps the biggest single technological problem dogging autonomous vehicle engineers: the complexity, capability and cost of &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;existing sensor systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Where current Lidar sensors send out individual pulses, Aeva's device sends out a continuous wave of light," writes Cade Metz in the NY Times profile of the company. "By reading the way this far more complex signal bounces off surrounding objects, Mr. Rezk said, the device can capture a far more detailed image while also tracking velocity. You can think of it as a cross between Lidar, which is so good at measuring depth, and radar, which is so good at measuring speed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Don't even think of this as a new kind of Lidar," Tarin Zyaee of &lt;a href="https://voyage.auto/" target="new"&gt;Voyage&lt;/a&gt;, who has seen with Aeva's prototype, told the Times. "It's a whole different animal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salehian and Rezk founded Aeva this past January with backing from Lux Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Lux partner Shahin Farshchi wrote a post for IEEE Spectrum titled "Driverless Tech Startups Are Driving Past a Trillion-Dollar Opportunity," in which he argued that companies were being overly ambitious and failing to build intermediary AV tech as they raced to Level 5 autonomy. In the article, Farshchi cited Aeva as a company that was working on a better timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have... funded Aeva, a stealth startup that is developing new sensing technologies to address the yet-to-be-solved challenges required for Level 3 through Level 5 automation," &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/advanced-cars/driverless-tech-startups-are-driving-past-a-trilliondollar-opportunity" target="new"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "These challenges include Lidar's limited range, radar's low resolution and inertial sensors that cost too much. Aeva's current system fits nicely into existing automotive design and assembly, which in this industry is as important as low cost."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now officially out of stealth mode, Aeva's tech will likely become increasingly visible in the weeks and months to come. Given the founders' pedigree and the speed with which they've brought their company into the public eye, chances are they've got something good to show us.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to autonomous vehicles, people tend to fall into a few different camps. There are those who think AV deployment is imminent, others who believe it's further down the road and those who think it will never happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each prediction comes with its own subset of beliefs. Within the group of people who think autonomous vehicles are coming soon, there are a range of different feelings, both pro and con, about that development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy in cars, of course, is nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autopilot has been available in Tesla vehicles since 2014, and Elon Musk's company will reportedly roll out &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/new-tesla-autopilot-functions-are-coming-in-the-next-several-months/" target="new"&gt;additional functionality&lt;/a&gt; in the coming months. Cadillac offers a hands-free driving system in the form of Super Cruise, and the new Audi A8 is equipped with a similar feature known as Traffic Jam Pilot. Uber, GM and Waymo operate autonomous ride-hailing services in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Phoenix, respectively, and all have plans to soon eliminate the in-car human operators that monitor the vehicular systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the process of getting autonomous vehicles on roads in large numbers takes much more than having viable technology ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human-driven cars have been a central aspect of American life for nearly a century now, and rewiring the norms, laws and behaviors that society has built around them may be an even bigger challenge than the technical one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, essentially, is the central argument of a column that Malcolm Gladwell penned for &lt;i&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/i&gt; in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In any period of technological transition, what proves vexing is not the technology itself. It's working out the details, rules, and social expectations around the technology," Gladwell &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/what-happens-when-we-give-up-control-of-our-cars-feature" target="new"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in the issue that he guest edited. "The autonomous-vehicle revolution is beginning, and we are now very much in the confusing stage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gladwell may be the most popular public intellectual today. He has written numerous articles for the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, immensely popular books like &lt;i&gt;Blink&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Outliers&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Tipping Point&lt;/i&gt;, and most recently began hosting the &lt;i&gt;Revisionist History&lt;/i&gt; podcast. As a pop sociologist with an interest in how people think, writing about public attitudes towards self-driving cars is right in Gladwell's wheelhouse. He also happens to be a car guy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"[Gladwell] remembered the testing we'd done on unintended acceleration and wanted to do a piece for his Revisionist History podcast on why people are liable to press the wrong pedal in panic situations," &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/columns/the-myths-surrounding-the-automated-car-abound-column" target="new"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/i&gt; editor in chief Eddie Alterman in describing how Gladwell's autonomous package originated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gladwell's take on the self-driving car movement is not particularly positive. He compares the possible implications of AV technology to those of smartphones, which have come to partially replace face to-face social interaction in the lives of young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It wasn't Audi, Ford, or GM that pushed hardest for the dependent vehicle. It was Apple, Google, and Intel, companies for which the automobile is not primarily an aesthetic object and driving is not an instrument of pleasure," Gladwell writes. "And the users they have in mind, needless to say, are not the readers of &lt;i&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/i&gt;. They are the kids lying passively on the couch with their smartphones."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/i&gt; readers, Gladwell has a sympathetic audience. Few people enjoy driving their own cars more than those who subscribe to automotive magazines. But that does nothing to diminish some of the critiques that Gladwell has of the autonomous vehicle and the future it portends.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As technology develops, new automobile safety features make their way into the market. After all, consumers want the safest car possible, and have demonstrated a willingness to pay for those benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is not the only incentive that drives automakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) have long compelled automakers by law to include certain safety features in their vehicles. Established in 1966, the FMVSS established many of the requirements that we now take for granted, including seat belts (1967), air bags (1984) and tire pressure monitoring systems (2005).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late in 2016, the Obama administration proposed making another feature required for all newly manufactured vehicles: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology. V2V is commonly referred to as the tech that allows cars to "talk" to one another, enabling them to individually and collectively be much safer on the roads. The proposal would have required that half of all new vehicles come equipped with the technology within two years, and that V2V be part of all new vehicles within four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, however, the proposed mandate may not come to fruition,
 according to the AP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The administration has decided not to pursue a final V2V mandate, said two auto industry officials who have spoken with White House and Transportation Department officials and two others whose organizations have spoken to the administration," &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2017-11-01/ap-newsbreak-govt-wont-pursue-talking-car-mandate" target="new"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Joan Lowy. "The industry officials spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize their relations with the administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days after the report was published, the DoT denied that it had made a final decision on the matter. They did not, however, state any specific intent to pursue the mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Department of Transportation and NHTSA have not made any final decision on the proposed rulemaking concerning a V2V mandate. Any reports to the contrary are mistaken," the NHTSA &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/trump-administration-reportedly-kills-vehicle-to-vehicle-safety-mandate/" target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Ars Technica. "In all events, DOT hopes to use the dedicated [radio] spectrum for transportation lifesaving technologies. Safety is the Department's number one priority."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To those who have followed the issue closely, the news that the V2V mandate is facing serious resistance will not come as a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April, Automotive News published an extensive report detailing the opposition to the change. No one seems to take issue with the technology itself. Even those opposed to the mandate preface their criticism with support of V2V. The concerns tend to be more ideological and business-oriented. There are free-market proponents who are against government regulation in general, and V2V entrepreneurs who believe their ventures would be put at a disadvantage by the proposed law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I would totally understand if NHTSA said, 'We're interested in safety and we want these safety features,'" Eran Shir, CEO of V2V company &lt;a href="https://www.getnexar.com/" target="new"&gt;Nexar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170417/OEM06/170419865/federal-v2v-mandate-meets-growing-resistance" target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Automotive News. "There are millions of lives at stake. What I think is less reasonable is if NHTSA comes and says we want to regulate the technology. That doesn't make sense."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its interconnected nature, V2V functionality becomes more effective with each additional vehicle that participates in the network. While some cars on the road are already equipped, and many more will be so in the coming years regardless of what the government does, the lack of a mandate could slow the establishment of a truly connected roadway.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Consumer vehicles are relatively inactive. Even for drivers with the most brutal commutes, their car likely isn't being used for more than four hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the time it's chilling in a &lt;a href="http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html"target="new"&gt;parking spot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four hours is certainly a long time to be commuting, but compared to cars that are constantly active -- taxis, cars in ride-hailing or ride-sharing fleets, long-haul trucks -- it's not much at all. If you think a family minivan needs constant repairs, imagine how much attention a taxi cab that operates almost around the clock requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the future of self-driving cars begins to take shape, it's becoming clear that one major feature of the automotive landscape will be autonomous ride-hailing and ride-sharing services. Many experts in the industry predict that these will be so prevalent that rates of car ownership will decline precipitously, especially in urban areas. One figures that a given robotaxi, unburdened by the constraints of the human sleep cycle, could be on the road literally nonstop.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, until it needs maintenance or repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this understanding of just how imperative timely, effective repairs will be to the viability of autonomous fleets, &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; announced in early November that it had reached a deal where &lt;a href="https://www.autonation.com/" target="new"&gt;AutoNation&lt;/a&gt;, the largest auto retailer in the United States, will maintain and repair Waymo's fleet of self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"AutoNation has built a reputation for providing excellent service and maintenance that makes cars safer and more reliable," Waymo CEO John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/autonation-signs-multi-year-service-agreement-with-waymo-300547981.html" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. "Both companies have a shared vision of enhancing the in-car experience of our customers. With its compelling national footprint, modern facilities and trained technicians, AutoNation will help assure that Waymo vehicles are always in top condition as we bring fully self-driving cars to the public."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospective hyperactivity of Waymo's autonomous vehicles makes AutoNation one of the few outfits that could be up to the task. As an enormous company with a nationwide presence, it will be able to service Waymo's fleet, whenever, wherever and however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These vehicles need to be in service for hundreds of thousands of miles, much more than personal-use vehicles, to make them economically viable," AutoNation CEO Michael J. Jackson &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/business/waymo-autonation-driverless.html" target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times. "To do that, you have to do much more proactive, preventative maintenance than what a normal person would do on a car."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo is a clear leader in the race to put passengers in self-driving cars. In October, Waymo began testing autonomous vehicles in Arizona without human monitors in the front seat, making it the first company to do so. If all goes according to plan, Waymo says, the company will offer autonomous services to consumers within the state in the coming months. It's all part of a plan to develop a driverless fleet that can serve passengers' desires at a moment's notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Because you're accessing vehicles rather than owning, in the future, you could choose from an entire fleet of vehicle options that are tailored to each trip you want to make," Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/technology/waymo-autonomous-cars.html" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a conference in early November. "They can be designed for specific purposes or tasks."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;With each passing year, automakers improve their connected car systems with updates and upgrades that have become increasingly essential for drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, infotainment systems have provided drivers with navigation information and streaming music to create a better user experience. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity represent the next evolution of these developments, promising cars that communicate with each other and a centralized grid to create safer roadways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anything that is connected to a network is vulnerable to hacking, and cars are certainly no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automotive industry is working diligently to adequately secure their state-of-the-art technology. The importance of this work to the companies' success was demonstrated with the recent news that German automotive manufacturing giant &lt;a href="https://www.continental-corporation.com/en" target="new"&gt;Continental&lt;/a&gt; had acquired Israeli cybersecurity company &lt;a href="https://argus-sec.com/" target="new"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Only secure mobility is intelligent mobility," Helmut Matschi, head of the Interior division at Continental, noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.continental-corporation.com/en/press/press-releases/2017-11-03-continental-argus-102094"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "With the acquisition of Argus Cyber Security we are enhancing our abilities to directly develop and offer solutions and services with some of the world's leading automotive cybersecurity experts to our customers around the globe in order to truly make mobility more intelligent and secure."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal were not announced, but it has been reported that Continental paid $400 million for Argus.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argus's existing team of 70 people will be folded into &lt;a href="https://www.elektrobit.com/" target="new"&gt;Elektrobit&lt;/a&gt;, the Continental subidiary that specializes in vehicle software. Argus and Elektrobit began working together in 2016 and last month announced an agreement to collaborate on over-the-air (OTA) vehicle software updates. Strategy Analytics Director Roger Lanctot was quoted at the time &lt;a href="https://argus-sec.com/argus-cyber-security-elektrobit-launch-end-end-solution-delivering-vehicle-software-updates-air-ota/" target="new"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; the partnership would allow Elektrobit to push out better updates, faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As software complexity increases in vehicles, the necessity and frequency of OTA software updates increases," Lactot said. "This poses greater inconvenience to drivers, as their vehicles are out of operation for the duration of these updates. The joint solution from Argus and EB is essential in managing the avalanche of code and reducing vehicle downtime."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the acquisition, Argus was the world's largest independent automotive cybersecurity company. The services it provides include risk assessment, code review and penetration testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argus offers protection against hacking of infotainment and telematics applications, as well as securing the in-vehicle network. The wide range of Argus's capabilities will now help Elektrobit innovate in the field of cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As we are experiencing a world of software-defined vehicles and face unique challenges, we are taking a proactive approach in developing new ways to collaborate and interact," Elektrobit president Alexander Kocher, wrote in a statement. "We are now offering to the automotive industry -- carmakers and suppliers alike -- a complete secure solution for the development of highly automated and connected driving. This will enable them to develop safer, smarter and more efficient vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a slate of projects that includes &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736195" target="new"&gt;eliminating door handles&lt;/a&gt; in favor of digital keys, Continental is always looking ahead to what's next in automotives. With Argus on board, the company has furthered its own ability to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In theory, an autonomous vehicle without connectivity features could navigate roads safely and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a sensor suite that was advanced and comprehensive enough, such a car could understand its surroundings and maneuver through dangerous traffic scenarios. With highly developed artificial intelligence, that car could also "read" road signs and traffic signals and comprehend less explicit contextual elements, to make sure it obeyed the rules of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, a "blind" vehicle that was fully connected could also travel without incident. If every automobile on the road were equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology, they could "talk" to one another and communicate their position and intentions, giving each car a complete understanding of the ones surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With complete vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology, a central intelligence system could also establish safe, efficient traffic patterns and guide cars accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;All of the technology described above exists in some form right now, although it is not in an advanced enough state to be ready for public rollout. But the two distinct categories -- autonomous and connected -- account for the bulk of the work being done in the automotive space right now. And, as Kim Tingley &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/09/magazine/tech-design-autonomous-future-cars-v2v-traffic-peloton.html" target="new"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in The New York Times Magazine, the two principles are naturally opposed to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, these two types of systems will have to complement each other, yet neither can be implemented all at once," Tingley writes. "In the meantime, the process of developing and deploying them often puts them at odds. Indeed, the two systems are, in a sense, philosophically opposed: libertarian self-reliance in a race with socialist collectivity to be the first to improve traffic flow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tingley's feature, "How to Make Cars Cooperate," is one of several that considers the future of automotives in the Times Magazine's Tech &amp; Design issue. She takes a deep dive on V2V connectivity, a concept with implementation that could be just as society-changing as autonomy, but also one that is far less known and understood. As Tingley points out, the way in which V2V will succeed is opposite to that of autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Automation thrives in the absence of regulation; V2V depends on it," she writes. "Without federal help, however, the upfront cost of connected infrastructure can be prohibitive for small towns and cities."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicle manufacturers are getting plenty of help from the feds -- both &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736110" target="new"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736893" target="new"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; bills promoting widespread expansion of AV testing have found overwhelming support this year. Conversely, reports emerged that the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/trump-admin-to-reverse-v2v-tech-mandate-report-says/" target="new"&gt;plans to set aside&lt;/a&gt; a V2V mandate for auto manufacturers that was proposed at the end of the Obama administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government officials made repeated denials that they had made such a decision in the days following the reports. Regardless, it remains clear that V2V advancement faces an uphill challenge before it becomes widely accepted and adopted in the US. But its implementation could be enormously helpful in providing a substantial counterbalance to the tools of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Today, the self-driving car has many homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US alone, there's Silicon Valley in California, which hosts Google spin-off Waymo, as well as ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, which have well-established autonomous ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Motor City, Detroit's automakers Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler have all poured significant resources into their own AV ventures. And academic institutions are helping cities such as Pittsburgh and Boston become hubs for autonomous development, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; birthplace of the self-driving car may be the Mojave Desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent video by &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/darpa-grand-urban-challenge-self-driving-car/" target="new"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; details the history of the DARPA Grand Challenge, a trio of races in the mid-2000s that birthed modern autonomous vehicle development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DARPA, which stands for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is the government body that effectively invented the Internet and GPS tracking services. In the early millennium, Congress enlisted DARPA to pursue the development of vehicular autonomy for military use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early going, DARPA didn't get far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Before the DARPA Grand Challenge, the U.S. government had spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to build self-driving cars and, lo and behold, most of this money didn't yield the expected results," Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google self-driving car team that eventually became Waymo, says in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PIJKE5KMtU" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So DARPA turned to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone and everyone was invited to participate in the DARPA Grand Challenge, a race in the Mojave Desert that would see which self-driving car could traverse a closed 150-mile course quickest. Of the 15 finalists that made it to competition, roboticist Red Whittaker's Carnegie Mellon team came the closest to completing the course: Their vehicle made it nearly eight miles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When we didn't have a finisher, that was a hard time. The way people look at challenges, if someone finishes it was a success and if they don't, it was a failure," said Norm Whitaker, a former project manager at DARPA. "For the scientists among us, that's just another data point, but people want to see somebody get through to the end."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But scientists were as excited as anyone else when another Challenge was organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one try under their belts and 18 months to improve, the developers from the 2004 Challenge joined a host of new competitors to give it another shot in 2005. While Whittaker's CMU team entered as a favorite, it was Thrun and his Stanford team that took home the $2 million prize, double what had been offered in the inaugural event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another 18 months passed before the third and final Challenge, which came with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge moved the competition from the desert to the 'burbs -- actually a model of a suburb built on a California Air Force base. Vehicles were given six hours to complete a series of tasks without crashing into one another or breaking California traffic laws. In the third and final Challenge, Carnegie Mellon finally took home a victory with a car nicknamed "Boss."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's racing and, you know, Boss had a little reputation of being aggressive," said Whittaker. "But it had the unimpeachable reputation of being smart, and handling everything that had to be handled, comfortably."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a platform for networking and collaboration, many look back on the DARPA Challenges as a series of events that made our current AV landscape possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While self-driving cars may still have a ways to go, they certainly have come quite far since none could make it farther than eight miles across a closed course in the Mojave Desert.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;To the vast majority of people, Uber is simply a ride-hailing company, albeit one that reshaped technology, transportation and labor by leveraging an app to provide rides from independent contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a smaller contingent are aware of Uber's ambitions to eventually replace those human drivers with vehicles controlled by artificial intelligence. But only the most loyal Uber watchers know about Uber AI Labs, a division of the company launched in late 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, Uber is a tech company even more than it is a transportation one, and artificial intelligence is an integral part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; is in the business of using technology to move people and things in the real world. With all of its complexity and uncertainty, negotiating the real world is a high-order intelligence problem," Uber Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/ailabs/" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post. "It manifests in myriad ways, from determining an optimal route to computing when your car or UberEATS order will arrive to matching riders for uberPOOL. It extends to teaching a self-driven machine to safely and autonomously navigate the world, whether a car on the roads or an aircraft through busy airspace or new types of robotic devices."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the foundations of Uber's work in AI is Pyro, a programming language developed in-house that melds deep learning methods with Bayesian statistical modeling -- a form of mathematics used for determining probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Uber, these  probability insights help the company figure out when rider demand will be high or low, when will traffic be heavy or light, and so on. And in November, Uber announced that the formerly walled-off Pyro would go open source so that third-party developers could take a shot at improving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe the critical ideas to solve AI will come from a joint effort among a worldwide community of people pursuing diverse approaches," team member Noah Goodman &lt;a href="https://eng.uber.com/pyro/" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "By open sourcing Pyro, we hope to encourage the scientific world to collaborate on making AI tools more flexible, open, and easy-to-use."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the announcement, Goodman lists several Uber use cases for AI, including "creating the next generation of intelligent vehicles." Sophisticated and flexible artificial intelligence is an essential element of fully self-driving cars that are set to be on our roads in the not-too-distant future. Having a deep -- but always expanding -- understanding of traffic patterns, driver behavior and road structures are what will put AVs over the top when it comes to being better than human drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber AI Lab's open sourcing of Pyro is yet another example of the collaboration that is so central to the advancement of 21st-century automotives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers will have an opportunity to distinguish themselves with valuable contributions to a high-profile platform, while Uber will be able to see that platform grow much faster than it would if only Uber employees were working on it. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A connected car system involves a ton of moving parts. Given the incredibly large amount of data that moves in and out of infotainment systems, advanced driver assistance systems, security systems and telematics systems for diagnostics, the processors in these vehicles have a lot on their plates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expands exponentially when the conversation shifts to self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to operating the aforementioned connected car systems at the highest-possible levels, autonomous vehicles need to integrate a suite of various sensors and HD maps into an operating system that utilizes cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the more lines of code there are underpinning all these operations, the more opportunity there is for mistakes and mishaps. But when it comes to multi-ton automobiles traveling at high speeds with living, breathing passengers on board, there isn't room for mistakes and mishaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help quell the concerns of connected car and autonomous vehicle developers looking to ensure they've made the safest products possible, &lt;a href="https://us.blackberry.com/" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; has introduced Jarvis, a new cybersecurity product for automakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry CEO John Chen introduced Jarvis at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software is able to scan binary files for coding errors or flaws. Jarvis also searches the files to ensure that they adhere to industry standards. Jarvis will operate as a cloud-based subscription service, meaning that customers pay as they go and can upload files to be scanned from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the aforementioned high stakes of fast-moving automobiles, there is great concern throughout the automotive industry regarding what would happen if a self-driving car were to be hacked and controlled remotely. Though less harrowing, of equal concern is the hacking of personal data, including financial information, by accessing connected car systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Connected and autonomous vehicles require some of the most complex software ever developed, creating a significant challenge for automakers who must ensure the code complies with industry and manufacturer-specific standards while simultaneously battle-hardening a very large and tempting attack surface for cybercriminals," Chen &lt;a href="https://us.blackberry.com/company/newsroom/press?id=2173233" target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jaguarlandrover.com/" target="new"&gt;Jaguar Land Rover&lt;/a&gt;, a preexisting &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738151" target="new"&gt; BlackBerry partner&lt;/a&gt;, has already signed on to use Jarvis in the development of connected and driverless car systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Jaguar Land Rover and BlackBerry share a common objective in bringing the most intelligent vehicles to reality," Jaguar Land Rover CEO Ralf Speth wrote in the statement. "BlackBerry Jarvis addresses the software cybersecurity needs of the automotive industry. In our independent study, Jarvis delivered excellent efficiencies in time-to-market, significantly reducing the time to security assess code from thirty days to seven minutes. The productivity delivered by Jarvis combined with BlackBerry's trusted security heritage can transform vehicle safety."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jarvis also has applications outside of automotives. BlackBerry noted that healthcare, aerospace and defense industries could all find the scanner useful. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicle technology is fertile ground for startups. Since almost all of the technology involved is still developing, small companies have ample opportunity to get involved, innovate and compete with larger companies on AV components such as Lidar sensors, artificial intelligence systems and HD mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But building a self-driving car from the ground up? That's an area that's still for the most part reserved for the big boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no coincidence that the companies taking on this challenge are traditional automakers. Even a self-driving heavyweight like Waymo still relies on a fleet of minivans produced by Chrysler. There are so many hardware and software costs associated with building a complete driverless car that it's hard to see how an independent startup could realistically compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not deterring the team at self-driving startup &lt;a href="https://www.pony.ai/" target="new"&gt;Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;. Pony.ai was only founded in late 2016, but it has set its sights on building a complete driverless car. If it falls short of its goals it probably won't be for lack of money. It was recently announced that Pony.ai received a whopping $112 million in financing for its Series A round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundraising was led by Morningside Venture Capital and Legend Capital, each of which has a primary focus on Chinese investments. (Pony.ai is "co-located" in Silicon Valley and Beijing.) Also participating in the round were Sequoia China, IDG Capital, Hongtai Capital, Legend Star, Puhua Capital, Polaris Capital, DCM Ventures, Comcast Ventures and Silicon Valley Future Capital. As the size of the investment suggests, these partners believe that Pony.ai has a chance to make an enormous splash in the autonomous vehicle space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Pony.ai is one of the very few companies we've seen that possesses the critical success factors: a team with a proven track record and extremely well-rounded technical expertise from both research and industry backgrounds," Legend Capital managing director Wenji Jin noted in a &lt;a href="https://nbherard.com/business/autonomous-driving-startup-pony-ai-raises-112m/55555" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "From product definition and systems integration to artificial intelligence, Pony.ai is the leader in this nascent industry. I believe Pony.ai holds the most promise in delivering [Level 4 vehicular autonomy] technology to the mass market."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's co-founders do indeed have an impressive pedigree. Co-founder and CTO Tiancheng Lou worked on Google's self-driving car project before it was spun off into what is now Waymo. Co-founder and CEO James Peng was a founding member of Baidu's autonomous driving team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pony.ai will use the Series A funding to launch an autonomous fleet in Guangzhou, China, where the company has an office. Before that, though, he says the company has some testing to do to ensure its vehicles can coexist with human-driven cars in real-world scenarios, according to Peng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think in the grand scheme of things the biggest challenge is still the uncertainty in the open driving environment," Peng told &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/15/one-year-old-pony-ai-raises-112-million-series-a-to-build-autonomous-car-future/" target="new"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "Robots have been out there for 30-40 years, and most of them are working in somewhat confined environments. Vehicles themselves are like robots, but they have to operate in uncertain environments."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the phrase "driverless cars" has been something of a misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the technology still being developed, safety concerns have necessitated at least one, and sometimes two, human monitors inside of autonomous vehicles. These monitors check the status of a vehicle and are ready to take over control should it become necessary. Of course, "self-driving cars with fully alert engineer attendants" doesn't quite have the same ring to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the day of truly "driverless" cars is approaching. &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, which has been a leader in the development of autonomous ride-hailing fleets, recently claimed that it was getting close to launching autonomous vehicles that could operate without a human backup. Eric Meyhofer, head of Uber's Advanced Technology Group that oversees self-driving cars, told the Associated Press that the company would put the monitor-free cars on roads once it felt it was completely safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Once we can check that box, which we call passing the robot driver's license test, that's when we can remove the vehicle operator," Meyhofer &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2018-01-17/uber-close-to-scrapping-human-backups-in-self-driving-cars" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. "We're going aggressively too."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber does seem to have made significant strides recently. It was only in October that Uber said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736654" target="new"&gt;remove a passenger's seat operator&lt;/a&gt; from its self-driving vehicles, leaving only one human operator in the driver's seat. The move was part of the relaunch of Uber's autonomous ride-hailing service in Pittsburgh, which originally began in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, only one company has officially announced that it will put operator-free AVs on the road: &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;. In November, the company divulged that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;already launched&lt;/a&gt; truly driverless cars around Phoenix, where it does much of its testing. It also released plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in that very area in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber, of course, is currently embroiled in a lawsuit filed by Waymo, alleging that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski stole thousands of proprietary files from the Google spin-off and brought them to Uber, where he went to work soon after. Late last year, a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739274" target="new"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; emerged in the case that described unethical work practices at Uber, including the use of "stolen Waymo trade secrets." While the case figures to drag on for far longer than anyone would like it to, it has already contributed to a significant decline in Uber's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether deploying a fully driverless fleet will improve that reputation. But big technology breakthroughs in the autonomous vehicle space are tough to ignore. If Uber can show that is at least keeping pace with Waymo in the race to create truly autonomous vehicles, it will go a long way to helping the company reclaim its status.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Two startups this week took on autonomous local delivery, a service that could become one of the early commercial uses of self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 30, &lt;a href="https://www.udelv.com/" target="new"&gt;Udelv&lt;/a&gt; sent a small self-driving van on a short loop through suburban San Mateo, Calif., to demonstrate a planned delivery service for grocery stores and other retailers. A grocer who participated in the demonstration said Udelv's vans and ordering software could cut delivery costs in half and give customers a better idea of when their orders will arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on Tuesday, Silicon Valley startup &lt;a href="https://nuro.ai/" target="new"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt; unveiled an even smaller autonomous delivery vehicle with no drivers seat or steering wheel. Its designed for neighborhood streets and is about half the width of a typical passenger car. The company also announced it has raised $92 million in two Series A rounds of funding. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Udelv and Nuro are the latest entrants into the last-mile delivery business, which has grown with the rise of online shopping. E-commerce giants and startups alike are looking at new technologies like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?node=8037720011" target="new"&gt;drones and sidewalk-roaming &lt;a href="https://www.starship.xyz/" target="new"&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt; to cut costs and delivery times, but the task may also be well suited to autonomous vehicles on the street.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;In Udelv's demonstration on Tuesday, its autonomous van made what the company called the world's first such delivery run on public roads. It covered a 2.5-mile route from Draeger's, a local market, to two nearby customers. As required by California law, a safety driver was at the wheel to take over if necessary, but the drive went flawlessly, Udelv said. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The startup, based in the neighboring town of Burlingame, designs and builds the vans itself using an electric drivetrain, chassis, sensors and other components from third parties. It won't sell the vehicles but offer delivery as a service to companies. The vehicle has a conventional cab and can be driven manually, or even remotely over a cellular connection, Udelv CEO Daniel Laury said. Its cargo space is divided into separate compartments, each with its own door that customers can unlock with their phones using Udelv's app.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The van's limited mission made it easier to develop than self-driving cars designed for passengers, Laury said. The vehicle is designed exclusively for local deliveries, with a top speed of 25 MPH. It didn't have to be designed for a comfortable ride or to deal with all possible driving and weather conditions that a long-range vehicle might run into. The van can go 60 miles between charges. It took about two years to develop, Laury said.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the major auto manufacturers, Udelv can start small, he said.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt; "There is a tremendous amount of business that we can do in states... that have great weather conditions, that have very nice roads, that have good driving policies," Laury told The Connected Car. "I don't see a Ford or a General Motors, or one of those large OEMs manufacturing a car for just California, for example."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udelv plans to put dozens of vans on the road this year in the San Francisco Bay Area. Under current state law, it can operate them autonomously in test mode with a safety driver as long as they're not making deliveries. The vans can also be used for deliveries as long as they're manually driven, Laury said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The San Mateo demonstration was done in conjunction with Draeger's, a small chain of upscale markets in the Bay Area, and Delivery Guys, which does deliveries for Draeger's. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Udelv should help Draeger's compete with big online retailers and with stores that use services like Instacart, said Richard Draeger, the owner of the chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Udelv's ordering platform and its driverless vans should make deliveries cheaper and more efficient, Draeger said. He predicts the cost of a delivery will be cut at least in half, and even more once the service is running at full volume. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"That is the biggest hurdle for delivery going mainstream," Draeger said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the current four-hour delivery window that customers get can be cut to one or two hours because Udelv's app and back-end software will streamline the process, he said. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;One thing a self-driving van can't do is bring groceries to the customer's door. That's a tradeoff, but with a shorter time window, they'll be more willing to stay home and wait for the van to arrive, Draeger said. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Uber chose cheating over innovation to catch up in a breakneck race toward self-driving cars, lawyers for rival Waymo charged Monday in opening arguments for its trade-secrets lawsuit against the ride-hailing giant.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The company that grew out of Google's autonomous car project fingered Uber founder Travis Kalanick as the prime culprit in the alleged theft of 14,000 confidential Google documents by former star engineer Anthony Levandowski, whom both sides called a key figure in the development of Lidar technology for automotive vision. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Kalanick "made a decision that winning was more important than obeying the law," said Waymo's lead attorney, Charles Verhoeven of the firm Quinn Emmanuel. He compared the former Uber CEO to a &lt;a href="http://archive.boston.com/sports/blogs/shesgamesports/2013/03/where-are-they-now-rosie-ruiz-and-the-man-who-uncovered-her-ruse.html" target="new"&gt;marathon runner&lt;/a&gt; who secretly takes the subway.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Uber, for its part, charged that Waymo was the company falling behind and that it sued Uber to stall its biggest rival. Levandowski brought nothing to Uber that wasn't commonly known among Lidar engineers, attorney Bill Carmody of Susman Godfrey said in Uber's opening argument. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740292&amp;" target="new"&gt;jury trial&lt;/a&gt; before Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco has put self-driving technology in the spotlight and Silicon Valley culture under the microscope. The opening arguments drew one of the biggest media throngs of any tech trial in recent memory, partly because Uber and Alphabet, the parent company of Google and Waymo, are among the most closely watched in the tech world. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Even before the jury was seated on February 5, Alsup made it clear tech-star privilege would have no place in his court. One witness who had requested a private room at the courthouse wasn't going to get it, he said. "You're going to have to be just like the rest of us," Alsup said. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The eight alleged secrets at issue in the case involve Lidar, the system most self-driving cars use to sense their surroundings by constantly bouncing laser beams off of objects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We paint the world with these beams of light and figure out where things are very precisely," Waymo CEO John Krafcik said on the witness stand Monday. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Levandowski led Google's development of Lidar until he resigned in late January 2016 for autonomous trucking startup Otto, which was founded a few days later. Otto publicly launched in May 2016 and was acquired by Uber in August, but Waymo charged that Levandowski was frequently in contact with Uber before Otto had even taken shape. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The plan all along was for Uber to "acqui-hire" Levandowski and other top Google engineers for their expertise and trade secrets they knew, Waymo's Verhoeven said, citing Uber meeting notes and other documents. The code name for this project? A dollar sign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Uber agreed to indemnify Levandowski and other top hires against allegations of intellectual property theft, Verhoeven said. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Krafcik, the first witness to take the stand, recalled taking over Google's car project in September 2015 and trying to get to know Levandowski better. "He was an interesting character," said Krafcik, a longtime automotive engineer and executive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two had different ideas about safety, with Levandowski opposed to Krafcik's insistence on including backup steering and braking systems in its self-driving vehicles, he said. But Levandowski's resignation the following January came as a surprise, Krafcik said. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"He had gone from someone I had considered a friend to someone I considered an enemy," he said. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Uber argued it took extraordinary measures to ensure it hadn't acquired any trade secrets after it acquired Otto. A forensics firm interviewed the new employees and examined the data on their personal devices, Carmody said. Waymo itself came to Uber 11 times to check its servers for proprietary information, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Waymo calls secrets are common Lidar knowledge that Google had considered posting publicly, Uber said. The company came by its core technology legitimately by hiring a team of engineers from Carnegie-Mellon University and other elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"The tech here tells the truth," Carmody said. "What's in here comes from people at Uber who bring to bear their engineering talents." &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to continue for about three weeks. Kalanick and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are among the possible witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For as long as the consumer car has been a primary mode of transportation, carpooling has been a staple of workday commutes around the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees who live within the vicinity of one another take turns picking each other up, driving each other to work, arguing over who gets to be the DJ, and driving each other home. Carpooling can save hundreds of dollars that would be spent on gas if everyone drove individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With reduced fuel usage comes reduced greenhouse gas emissions, something that has become a priority for an increasing number of folks in recent years. Plus, by sharing a ride, carpoolers are able to bond with one another by socializing outside of the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our autonomous vehicle future changes the landscape of our roads and fundamentally shifts the way we think about commuting, many common driving practices will likely be phased out from our culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carpooling, however, won't be one of them. In fact, it may become even more popular. But it could look an awful lot different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It already does for employees at &lt;a href="https://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;, who will be the first to test a new ride-sharing app from the company's &lt;a href="https://www.getcruise.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; division. As its name suggests, the new product is more than a ride-sharing app -- it's a ride-sharing app with self-driving cars. Known as Cruise Anywhere, the app is already in use by Cruise Automation employees in the San Francisco area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've always said we'd launch first with a rideshare application, and this is in line with that and just further evidence of that," Cruise CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/cruise-is-running-an-autonomous-ride-hailing-service-for-employees-in-sf/" target="new"&gt;told TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "We're really excited about how the technology is evolving, and the rate at which it's evolving. This is a manifestation of that -- putting the app in people's hands and having them use it for the first time and make AVs their primary form of transportation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For employees using the app's beta, the service extends beyond carpooling to work. A fleet of Chevy Bolt EV test cars run seven days a week, for 16 to 24 hours per day. Within the next two months, the fleet is set to expand with the addition of more than 100 Bolts. That increase would, in theory, make the Cruise service available at all times, although the user base figures to scale up alongside the influx of vehicles. While the cars drive themselves, law requires that there be a human sitting in the driver's seat, ready to take over as driver if something were to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many involved in autonomous vehicles, a vision of the roads of tomorrow involves a strong emphasis on ride-sharing and car-sharing services to make life easier for riders and to make roads more efficient. Recently, Jonathan Hampson, general manager of Zipcar UK, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734651" target="new"&gt;spoke out against&lt;/a&gt; private ownership of autonomous vehicles in cities, speculating that they would crowd streets too tightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it seems unlikely that people will want to surrender personal ownership of automobiles, there's good reason to believe that ride-sharing and car-sharing services will grow as autonomous vehicles become more mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When we think about cars, our biggest safety concern is preventing crashes. But when connected cars hit the road, we also need an airbag for our network. These safety precautions must be taken as seriously as the life-changing impacts of collisions. If left unaddressed, cybersecurity threats have the potential to jeopardize the transformative future of these innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appropriate security protections are essential to maximizing the benefits of connected cars, and keeping drivers and passengers safe. Every connected vehicle is tied into a network with a wealth of valuable and private information.  And we're doing our part to help protect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things every connected car manufacturer and stakeholder should keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telecom companies and car manufacturers need to collaborate now more than ever.
As connected car functionality becomes more network connected, and as software updates and downloads become more prevalent on network connectivity, the interdependence of these two platforms will only increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the relationship grows, so should the collaboration between the telecom companies and car manufacturers. This is necessary to deliver greater platform-to-platform security, improved end-to-end security, and most importantly, increased safety for the vehicle's occupants and their surrounding environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four major risk types against the vehicle and it's important to be prepared for each. The &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/"target="new"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NHTSA) has identified direct cyber threats to four types of data or control:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Privacy and security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unwanted or unauthorized commercial transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-safety operational interference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety-related operational interference&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These multiple risk points call for end-to-end security between the vehicle and telecommunications platforms. This requires highly secure communication paths outside of the vehicle, as well as the environment that makes up the internal vehicle platform. Providing end-to-end security includes:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;End-to-end security outside the vehicle: Connecting the car as it communicates with the cloud, with specific servers or with individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End-to-end security inside the vehicle: Between car manufacturers and their suppliers -- including software and hardware suppliers -- along the critical data and communication paths within the vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to cyberattacks directed against the vehicle, it's also possible for attacks to be directed against the cloud- based platforms that offer connected vehicle services. If these services are compromised, the attacker could exploit vehicle fleet interfaces as well as external-facing commercial and business interfaces to partner organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;These services are likely to be attractive targets since they could contain financial data on users, and could ultimately lead to widespread infection.&lt;/p&gt; 


&lt;p&gt;Telecom companies' role in network security. With that in mind, carriers have an important role to play in helping to secure connectivity to/from cloud services, remote servers and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Network security should be a core competency for telecommunications network providers. Security features must be designed into the fabric of the communications infrastructure in order to offer highly secure connections to the end-user device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective cybersecurity strategy must recognize the many possible communications paths to the connected vehicle, thus telecom carriers need an effective, layered approach. Further, as carriers work with vehicle manufacturers to deliver more secure vehicle strategies, a comprehensive end-to-end security framework can assist in seeing to it that all the links and parts of each path are highly secure.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In any industry, research and development prototyping can quickly rack up some outsized expenses. Without the economy of scale that comes from mass production, manufacturing a one-off becomes really pricey, especially when the product in question involves a lot of components and relies on newer technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building autonomous vehicle prototypes checks off all these boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the real payoff of this R&amp;D lies years -- if not decades -- down the road makes it all the more daunting for established automakers and startups alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why finding means of testing autonomous systems outside of cars is an attractive alternative. Microsoft recently announced its researchers' &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/features/science-mimics-nature-microsoft-researchers-test-ai-controlled-soaring-machine/" target="new"&gt;development of autonomous gliders&lt;/a&gt;. While the main focus of the news centered on planes controlled by artificial intelligence up in the air, the technology could be utilized in areas with significantly lower elevation, namely autonomous cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What makes Microsoft's sailplane project so useful to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; autonomous vehicle development is that it provides a relatively cheap platform for testing and training AI agents to independently operate a machine," Neel V. Patel wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/35694-microsoft-autonomous-gliders-driverless-cars-vehicles" target="new" rel="noopener"&gt;an article for Inverse&lt;/a&gt;. "Although the sailplane is just one specific type of vehicle, the algorithm that makes up the AI system is designed to physically navigate a machine around in three dimensions. There aren't many factors that separate what an algorithm must do to correctly operate a glider versus a drone, or land vehicle like a car."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/daINKmR1M-4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the average new passenger car weighs over two tons, the sailplanes tested by Microsoft resemble model airplanes at 16.5 feet long and 12.5 pounds. The artificial intelligence software that powers the sailplanes still represents millions of dollars in development. But the fact that it is housed in a physical body that is cheaper by an order of magnitude than a car is significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many overlapping functions of a self-piloted glider and a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each must perceive and understand their physical surroundings. For most self-driving cars, this primarily means using laser systems to detect other cars in their immediate vicinity, as well as unexpected objects in the road. Microsoft's gliders, on the other hand, are more concerned with identifying things like wind direction and air temperature. The decision-making algorithms that both AVs use to interpret this received information, though, are similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar, but not interchangeable, according to AI researcher Peter Stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many people think of AI as one single entity that can be sprinkled onto all sorts of things," Stone told Inverse. "And that's just not true. [That said,] the algorithms developed to deal with decision making and perception can be generally applied."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they're doing different work, developers of artificial intelligence, regardless of vehicle type, are looking to solve the same underlying issues. If a solution is discovered in self-piloted aircrafts, you can bet that a similar breakthrough in self-driving cars will follow soon after.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;With as much discussion around autonomous vehicles as there is today, it's easy to forget that this is still an industry in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As recently as the late aughts, Google was really the only company known to have aspirations in the self-driving car space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, seemingly every major tech company and automaker -- not to mention a long list of startups -- has thrown their hats into the ring. The marketplace is now so crowded that it has become a necessity for companies to form alliances and partnerships with other industry players. Whether it's because of financial hurdles or tech challenges, no one can afford to go it completely alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise, then, that the much-hyped alliance of BMW, Intel and Mobileye brought in another big-name member, Fiat-Chrysler, in August. BMW and Intel had joined forces in July of 2016 and the addition of Fiat-Chrysler gives the consortium a significant boost in automobile resources for testing and engineering, particularly in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In order to advance autonomous driving technology, it is vital to form partnerships among automakers, technology providers and suppliers," Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/fiat-chrysler-automobiles-join-bmw-group-intel-mobileye-autonomous-driving-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a joint statement&lt;/a&gt; from the four companies. "Joining this cooperation will enable FCA to directly benefit from the synergies and economies of scale that are possible when companies come together with a common vision and objective."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now, the general perception has been that Fiat-Chrysler trailed fellow automakers like Ford and GM, but its new partners are likely to change that. In the same statement, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua spoke about the platform that Fiat-Chrysler will be making contributions to and benefiting from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We welcome FCA's contributions and use of the cooperation's platform, which has made substantial progress over the last year and is rapidly entering the testing and execution phase," Shashua said. "The combination of vision-intense perception and mapping, differentiated sensor fusion, and driving policy solutions offers the highest levels of safety and versatility, in a cost-efficient package that will scale across all geographies and road settings."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the marquee names, the partnership has plenty of other contributors since each company brings with it its own set of collaborators. One company that works with all of them is &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735290" target="new"&gt;Delphi Automotive&lt;/a&gt;, a leader in developing the computer software that powers and guides self-driving cars. It was announced in May that BMW, Intel and Mobileye &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/bmw-intel-and-mobileye-bring-delphi-in-on-their-self-driving-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;would be working with Delphi&lt;/a&gt; on their platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delphi has other partnerships as well, including ones with Audi and French company Transdev. Fiat-Chrysler does, too, most notably with Waymo. It's leading to a "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"-style game with all of the AV technology partnerships. While it may be difficult to keep track of who is working with who, the sharing of learning is likely to lead to faster deployment of new technologies and accelerate the date when autonomous vehicles take to the streets.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The primary challenge for getting self-driving cars on the road is -- of course -- building self-driving cars. Despite staggering advances in autonomous vehicle technology, there is still a long way to go to perfect these capabilities.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are additional challenges beyond the engineering ones. Establishing the legal baseline for these vehicles is the most important, according to Mike Ramsey, research director at technology research firm Gartner,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The biggest hurdle will likely be regulatory," Ramsey said recently &lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-road-to-connected-autonomous-cars/" target="new"&gt;in a Q&amp;A&lt;/a&gt;. "Governments will need to feel comfortable with the rules put in place before these cars are released to the general public."

&lt;p&gt;Since a government's actions reflect the will of the people, a major step in advancing favorable autonomous vehicle legislation involves convincing individuals of the merits of AVs. And, according to Gartner, recently observed opinions could suggest that the needle is moving in a positive direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3790963" target="new"&gt;In a Gartner survey&lt;/a&gt; that polled 1,519 Americans and Germans between April and May of this year, 45% of respondents said they would consider riding in fully autonomous vehicles. To some, that may sound like an underwhelming number -- Gartner actually frames it as 55% of respondents &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being willing to ride in a fully self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you add context to the data, however, it becomes much more of a glass half-full than a glass half-empty scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, fully autonomous vehicles don't exist yet. Level 5 autonomy, the level at which a car can pilot itself anywhere without ever needing assistance from a human driver, &lt;a href="http://jalopnik.com/this-video-perfectly-explains-the-levels-of-autonomous-1795068093" target="new"&gt;is purely theoretical at this time&lt;/a&gt;. So without something concrete to react to, it's easy to understand why some respondents were leery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of more relevance was the response to another question in the survey: "Would you consider riding in a semi-autonomous vehicle?" To that question, 71% of respondents said yes. If and when people have positive experiences with semi-autonomous vehicles, they'll be emboldened to try the full version (when it exists). A willing rider in a semi-autonomous vehicle will likely become a willing rider in a fully autonomous vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey also yielded a few other interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the number of people who used a ride-hailing or ride-sharing service increased from 19% to 23% over the last 12 months. This shift indicates an openness to an evolving automobile landscape. That openness will be key as the landscape starts to incorporate AVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The automotive industry is investing in new safety and convenience technology at a rate not seen since the dawn of the automobile," Ramsey said. "The experience of owning and operating a car will be dramatically different in ten years."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If you're a user of the navigation app Waze, there's a good chance that you're a loyal one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waze has more than 65 million monthly active users spread across 185 countries, according to the company's &lt;a href="https://www.waze.com/driverindex"target="new"&gt;2016 Driver Satisfaction Index&lt;/a&gt;. It's a good thing that the app is so popular since the more people that use Waze, the better the service that the app provides. Waze users take it upon themselves to report car accidents, traffic jams, police traps, construction zones and more. These events appear superimposed on the app's GPS map, allowing all of its users to see events on the road from a bird's eye view and adjust their routes accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.waze.com/" target="new"&gt;Waze&lt;/a&gt;, along with Google Maps, are about to see some competition in the form of some powerful partners. BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz announced in late July that they would actively help develop &lt;a href="https://here.com/en" target="new"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;, a real-time traffic app that will serve precisely the same purpose as Waze. The automakers had previously teamed up to buy HERE from Nokia in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having three major OEMs involved is critical to how HERE hopes to differentiate itself from Waze. Instead of presenting user-reported events on the road, HERE looks to leverage sensor data from connected cars to give up-to-the-moment traffic reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the world's first traffic service to aggregate live rich vehicle sensor data from competing car brands and it represents a major step by HERE to make driving safer and more efficient for people everywhere," &lt;a href="https://here.com/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2017-26-07" target="_blank"&gt;HERE senior vice president of Automotive&lt;/a&gt; Ralf Herrtwich wrote in a statement. "While it helps drivers making informed decisions behind the wheel today, it also moves us closer to realizing our vision of a live representation of the road environment needed for both advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-driving applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If HERE's plan sounds ambitious, that's because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For collecting its data, Waze has a fleet of human users that can easily characterize what they're observing: There's construction that necessitates a detour off of Exit 191, or there's a fender bender that has traffic at a standstill at 21st &amp; 6th. While vehicular sensor technology has become quite advanced in its own right, it's still fundamentally incapable of differentiating an accident-induced traffic jam versus one caused by natural traffic patterns. Given a vast number of sensor data points, however, one can draw conclusions about what's causing a delay. With access to data from several of the world's largest automakers, HERE gets a significant leg-up from its partnership with Audi, Mercedes and BMW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The dozens of sensors equipped on modern cars make them the richest possible source of real-time traffic data," said Andrew Hart, Director at SBD Labs. "HERE has developed a win-win approach to accessing and analyzing rich vehicle data."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimum approach to reporting traffic information probably lies somewhere in between Waze's user reporting and HERE's sensor data collection. It remains to be seen just how far the capabilities of data from vehicle sensors will progress in the coming years, but given the clout of the companies behind it, HERE certainly has a better shot than anyone else currently in the market of helping that technology reach its potential.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be a news junkie to know that the passing of bipartisan legislation in Congress is a rare occurrence these days. Any vote is more likely than not to split directly along party lines, perhaps save for a couple of brave defectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was something of a remarkable triumph, then, when the House Energy &amp; Commerce committee approved the wider House floor legislation that would allow many more &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734506"target="new"&gt;self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt; on the road by a unanimous 54-0 vote. For legislation to pass unanimously in 2017, it has to essentially be strongly approved by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, almost everyone. Various labor unions have made noise in the wake of the committee's approval of the legislation, noting the economic implications of a driverless car future -- specifically, the prospective job losses that will be brought about by autonomous commercial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If anyone needs to be at the table for a discussion on self-driving technology, it's the package car driver, the longhaul truck driver and the taxi driver," &lt;a href="https://teamster.org/news/2017/06/teamsters-call-lawmakers-prioritize-workers-self-driving-discussion" target="new"&gt;wrote Jim Hoffa&lt;/a&gt;, general president of the Teamsters, the largest union in North America, in a statement. "We are encouraged that legislators are soliciting feedback on early proposed legislation, and we firmly believe it's important that their constituents -- and that includes Teamsters -- are involved in the process and listened to throughout."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation that the House will address after an August recess puts a 10,000-pound weight limit on self-driving cars that will be permitted for trials on public roads. This is a provision that will largely exclude commercial vehicles -- namely freight trucks. It's a direct result of lobbying from unions, but they know it won't last forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't take a lot of imagination to see that the bill will set the stage for driverless technology into commercial transportation via Lyft or Uber or other rideshare entities," Larry Willis, president of the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Division, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-28/unions-urge-slow-down-as-self-driving-car-bills-pick-up-speed" target="new"&gt;told Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. "And let's be very clear here: Once you set the precedent in this bill, I think it's very likely that you are going to see the same type of regulation migrate to commercial vehicles more broadly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union representatives are right to be wary: &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/03/prweb14145045.htm" target="new"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; by the Center for Global Policy Solutions estimated that the driverless vehicle future could cause the loss of up to 4 million jobs, including those of truckers, bus drivers and taxi drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This crisis is likely right around the corner," said Dr. Maya Rockeymoore, president and CEO of the Center for Global Policy Solutions. "We need a strong safety net that can bolster workers in the event of large-scale, rapid job losses, along with policies that can transition them to new jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, job concerns on both sides of the issue. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) knows that if jobs in the autonomous vehicle sector aren't made available in her district, they will be made available elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are going to be new jobs. We have to keep talking about that. This is just the beginning," Dingell told Bloomberg. "If those vehicles get built in another country, those jobs are gone."&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For those of us with an intense interest in self-driving cars, the appeal is self-evident and exciting. Individuals would be able to work, eat, read or just relax with a movie in their car as the vehicle drives itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a wider scale, we see that the world will be changed when, as many analysts predict, traffic deaths are reduced by 90% thanks to the ability of cars to speak to one another. We marvel at, and enthusiastically use, the autonomous functions on our current vehicles like self-parking and single-lane highway autopilot. It's important to remember, however, that most American consumers are not so psyched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Yet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overwhelming number of consumers -- 74% -- believe that self-driving cars are "not safe," and will remain so into the foreseeable future, according to &lt;a href="https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/deloitte-review/issue-20/winning-consumer-trust-future-of-automotive-technology.html#endnote-sup-22" target="new"&gt;a study published by Deloitte&lt;/a&gt; early this year. The report is based on responses from 22,000 consumers in 17 different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even from a perspective of pure interest, the numbers are underwhelming. Only 43% of drivers were interested in "limited self-drive" features, which would include offerings like parking assist, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this lukewarm attitude towards vehicles with autonomous features? A lack of education on the part of OEMs and other autonomous vehicle advocates is resulting in a lack of awareness on the part of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Center for Automotive Research &lt;a href="http://www.cargroup.org/mbs/" target="new"&gt;Management Briefing Seminars&lt;/a&gt; in Traverse City, Mich., Kay Stepper, vice president of automated driving for Bosch, spoke about the imperative of showing drivers how to use the self-driving technology that already populates many automobiles and is set to be equipped on many more in the future. A significant hurdle to consumer acceptance lies in the worries that come with fully trusting a machine at high speeds, Stepper said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the concerns certainly that's out there still is lack of control, and basically trusting the machine to take over the driving task," Stepper &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170731/OEM06/170739907/bosch-explaining-autonomous-to-consumers-will-be-critical" target="new"&gt;told Automotive News&lt;/a&gt;. "What happens if an unforeseen situation comes across that the machine was not trained for?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those concerns are understandable, and that's why education is so necessary. Bosch hosts events to teach consumers about its offerings, and even has an online platform known as the &lt;a href="http://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.us/us/highlights/automated-mobility/amc/" target="new"&gt;Bosch Automated Mobility Academy&lt;/a&gt;. And while those are excellent supplementary tools, Stepper understands that the most effective teaching incorporates hands-on learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To experience what it's like when it actually happens, that is a completely different matter," Stepper said of backup autonomous systems that can protect self-driving cars. "It's an important aspect to showcase and bring to consumers and the general public."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepper noted that with the current model of car sales, OEMs are simply unable to provide adequate direct-to-consumer teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It comes down to education in the dealership, that's where a lot of the conversation happens," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that necessitates a different kind of teaching for Bosch and other manufacturers of AV technology. They need to train car dealers to be able to adequately convey the value of this tech to their buyers. Until that is the case, everyday drivers will likely remain wary of their cars' self-driving features, rendering them unused.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Toyota launched the Collaborative Safety Research Center (CSRC) at the Toyota Technical Center in Ann Arbor, Mich. As its name suggests, the center was designed to foster collaboration on auto safety projects between the automaker and nearly everyone else: federal agencies, hospitals, and other public and private research institutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Toyota's new safety research center will work with leading North American universities and other partners on safety projects that benefit the entire industry," Toyota President Akio Toyoda &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2011/01/15/toyota-decides-to-build-collaborative-safety-research-center-in/" target="new"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;. "Our investment will support collaborative research aiming to reduce driver distraction and increase the safety of vehicles, drivers, passengers and pedestrians."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the initiative has lived up to its goals, and then some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its founding, CSRC has completed 44 research projects on automobile safety with 23 different universities, and published over 200 papers on its findings. In May, the Center announced an extension of the original program called &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyotas-collaborative-safety-research-center-csrc-launches-csrc-next-to-study-autonomous-and-connected-vehicle-technologies-300465744.html" target="new"&gt;CSRC Next&lt;/a&gt; that pledged $35 million in research over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The launch of CSRC Next reflects Toyota's understanding of the importance of human interaction with emerging and advanced vehicle technologies," CSRC director Chuck Gulash wrote. "These highly advanced systems are radically reshaping the transportation landscape, building a relationship between drivers, occupants and vehicles as teammates working together safely and conveniently. We are excited to continue our safety mission by helping to support a safe evolution to a broader mobility future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At launch, CSRC Next included eight projects. Now CSRC has announced 11 projects with eight different partner institutions. These projects will address safety specifically with regards to connected and self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Autonomous and connected vehicle technologies are only just beginning to transform the transportation landscape," &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyotas-collaborative-safety-research-center-launches-new-research-tracks-to-study-autonomous-and-connected-vehicle-technologies-300493684.html" target="new"&gt;Gulash added&lt;/a&gt;. "By working together with world-renowned institutions and making our results public, we are proud to help realize the promise of advanced mobility solutions and a safe, convenient transportation future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects will follow four different research tracks: integrating advanced active safety systems and passive safety systems, building models to understand and support the social acceptance of connected and autonomous vehicles, studying driver state detection and using big data to study naturalistic driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics are broad, but the research projects are specific. A collaborative project with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, called "Motion and Muscle Activation of Young Volunteers in Evasive Vehicle Maneuvers," will test how child occupants react to emergency responses by self-driving cars. Another study with the University of Wisconsin, "Theory of Communication Between Drivers -- Enhancing Social Interaction," takes a more abstract approach: It will "provide theoretical and mathematical framework of how drivers communicate at an intersection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSRC's pivot to directly address the safety of connected cars and autonomous vehicles is important symbolically, as it shows a major automaker's willingness to invest heavily in the nitty-gritty of these technologies. Its effect goes far beyond the symbolic, though. The CSRC's track record tells us that these studies will be of great value to everyone (not just Toyota) who works to ensure that the vehicles of tomorrow will be safer than the vehicles of today.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For those with connected cars, certain functionalities of their vehicles quickly become indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The built-in navigation features offer a seamless GPS experience, one that represents a significant upgrade over squinting at a phone screen while one should be looking at the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security features like remote lock/unlock and vehicle tracking services provide a peace of mind that would otherwise not exist. Even the luxuries of, say, a morning Spotify playlist can be a day-changer, especially for those that live in areas with less appealing FM radio options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone has a connected car. Most people don't. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/01/27/connected-cars-by-the-numbers-infographic/#fe182c010288" target="new"&gt;A 2015 estimate&lt;/a&gt; projected that 20% of cars sold in that year would be connected. While that number has grown, cars of an older era still represent the majority of vehicles on the road, which means relatively few people have experienced the joys of the connected car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, new technology means they may not have to wait until their next car purchase to access these features. &lt;a href="https://www.bouncie.com/" target="new"&gt;Bouncie&lt;/a&gt; is a plug-in adapter that communicates with an app on users' smartphones to give them connected car style diagnostics, analytics and tracking services much like they would get from a connected car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set-up is simple: Bouncie's tiny device plugs into the on-board diagnostics port that is on every car made in the last 20 years, making it compatible with every vehicle made since 2006. With access to the vehicle's internal diagnostics, the accompanying app can then give car owners a bevy of information about their car's internal workings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app will give you an exact reading of how much fuel you have left, meaning you no longer have to play the guessing game of when you could run out of gas on the highway. Battery level, too, is displayed with precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DF70C2msgRc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of Bouncie's features -- and much of its early marketing -- revolve around family services. For decades, use of the family car has been a battleground between concerned parents and freedom-deprived teenagers. Bouncie offers parents a decisive upper hand in that battle. (Of course, as those parents will tell you, everyone wins when safety is involved.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the app, users can see when and how their car was driven, down to the mile, receiving information on speed and braking patterns, among other metrics. Users can see where there car is at all times, and can draw geographical bubbles, receiving notifications any time their car leaves that pre-set bubble. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF70C2msgRc" target="new"&gt;A YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; features a man describing how Bouncie has put his mind at ease with location services for his aging parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Bouncie doesn't transform a vehicle into a full-on connected car. Infotainment options, for example, are not a part of the product's offerings. For connected car manufacturers, that can be seen as a good thing: Perhaps once users get a taste of some connected car capabilities, they'll be inspired to purchase the whole shebang.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For years, Apple Maps represented an inferior product offered by a company that was thought to be above inferior products. It reached the point where the app was something of a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the introduction of iOS 6 in September 2012, &lt;a href="http://apple.com/" target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; shifted away from its Google-based mapping service in favor of a native, proprietary app for the iPhone. &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-apple-maps-debacle-2012-9" target="new"&gt;It was a full-blown disaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it by no means spelled the end of the company, the software travesty certainly damaged Apple's can't-miss reputation. Making the problem worse was how critical maps apps are for many users. It's one thing if your podcasts app malfunctions, but it's significantly more consequential if an app gets you lost in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Apple Maps has greatly improved since then, its existence has largely been defined by the game of catch-up it perpetually plays with &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/" target="new"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If recent job postings are any indication, Apple is beginning to play that game with significantly more intention of winning. Since the beginning of July, the company has posted job listings for over 70 positions in its Maps division. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/02/apple-has-over-70-map-tech-job-openings.html" target="new"&gt;Abilities around functions&lt;/a&gt; like geospatial information services, fleet management and navigational aids are highlighted in the job descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

These job openings and their duties are highly variable. A listing for a GIS Engineer notes that the employee hired will "develop and run map maintenance processes." A QA Analyst "is responsible for the GIS production data quality evaluation, comparative data analysis and trends analysis." A Software Engineer for Routing "will develop cutting-edge routing algorithms to constantly improve the routing experience and help millions of people every day with their driving, walking and public transit."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As several outlets have speculated, Apple will likely use these prospective hires to work on two key technologies, in addition to its existing Maps products: augmented reality and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality overlays digital images on the real-world environment as seen through a screen. Perhaps the best-known recent example is the Pokemon Go game that emerged as a worldwide sensation last summer -- users attempted to capture Pokemon that, through their phones, appeared to be right in front of them on a street or at a park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those in the connected car sector are no doubt familiar with the concept of autonomous systems, and Apple's intentions with regards to self-driving car technology has been a point of curiosity for years. CEO Tim Cook made headlines recently when discussing autonomous systems, although he hinted that Apple would not limit its use of the technology to automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view," Cook told investors on an earnings call. "We do have a large project going and are making a big investment in this ... Autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one. But there are many different areas of it, and I don't want to go any further with that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the announcement of a new iPhone expected in September, Apple will be in the news a ton for the latest model of its signature product. Keep an eye on the Maps team, though. Their actions and words could give hints as to what the company is working on with autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Depending on your point of view, graffiti can be either an act of vandalism that is a blight on city streets or a legitimate, albeit underground, art form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for autonomous cars, graffiti can represent something altogether different. It can be a dangerous physical hazard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A paper recently published by Yoshi Kohno and fellow researchers at the University of Washington entitled "&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08945" target="new"&gt;Robust Physical-World Attacks on Machine Learning Models&lt;/a&gt;" confirmed that autonomous vehicle systems are likely to be confused by street signs that have been altered in appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;This isn't entirely surprising since autonomous vehicles use logic to operate and alterations to a street sign could confuse that logic. More shocking, however, was the precise nature of these alterations and their consequences: By doctoring street signs to intentionally manipulate an autonomous vehicle's algorithms, Kohno and his team were able to cause self-driving cars to behave inappropriately and dangerously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We physically realized and evaluated two attacks," according to the report. "One that causes a stop sign to be misclassified as a speed limit sign in 100% of the testing conditions, and one that causes a right turn sign to be misclassified as either a stop or added lane sign in 100% of the testing conditions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each attack, stickers designed to confuse the automobiles in a specific way were affixed to street signs. In the former, the test cars consistently identified stop signs as 45mph speed limit signs, causing them to accelerate through the intersections on a test track. In the second experiment, vehicles would go straight in an instance where they were supposed to go right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We hypothesize that given the similar appearance of warning signs, small perturbations are sufficient to confuse the classifier," reads the report. "In future work, we plan to explore this hypothesis with targeted classification attacks on other warning signs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of Kohno's team's discoveries are obvious, and scary. Someone with access to or deep knowledge of an autonomous vehicle system -- and an equally deep supply of malicious intent -- could set up passengers in self-driving cars for some incredibly dangerous situations. Presumably, a self-driving car's safety systems would lessen the potential danger of such a "hack" by causing the car to stop or swerve to avoid danger in the aftermath. However, there's probably only so much these systems could do to avoid a T-bone in an intersection when multiple vehicles are converging on one another at high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring cybersecurity experts has become a top priority for OEMs in the autonomous vehicle space, as the devastating outcomes that could result from any sort of hack have certainly kept more than a few engineers awake at night. Rather than shy away from the thought, though, researchers like Kohno have leaned into the darkest possibilities of our autonomous vehicle future. Every time they do, though, those possibilities become less and less likely of becoming a reality.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Security remains a contentious issue for businesses of all kinds, and the connected car market is no exception. Now, an industry trade group is proposing new guidelines to thwart cyberattacks on these vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atis.org/"target="new"&gt;The Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions&lt;/a&gt; (ATIS), which has traditional worked within the &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=11&amp;p_id=242"target="new"&gt;information and communications technology&lt;/a&gt; (ICT) industry but has recently reached out to collaborate with automobile OEMs, released a whitepaper that looks to create new security rules and guidelines to better protect connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATIS published the whitepaper, entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.atis.org/connected-cars/?utm_source=press_room&amp;utm_medium=press_release&amp;utm_campaign=launch_release"target="new"&gt;Improving Vehicle Cybersecurity: ICT Industry Experience &amp; Perspectives&lt;/a&gt;," on August 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OEMs already have existing, one-on-one relationships with many telecoms, chip makers and service providers, the goal of the ATIS whitepaper is to ensure all the different players within the connected car market agree to basic guidelines regarding cybersecurity, especially as more and more software is written for cars with updates to that software transmitted over wireless networks to vehicles on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vehicles are going to be receiving software and communication links over networks and those networks need to be as secure as they possibly can be," said Tom Gage, CEO and managing director of Marconi Pacific, who also chairs ATIS' Connected Car Cybersecurity Ad Hoc Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They are already secure vis--vis delivering text and data and voice to cell phones, machine-to-machine and IoT, but the vehicle world is very important because of the high risk associated with vehicles getting out of control as they have software that increasingly controls how they function, and, ultimately as they become full automated vehicles," Gage told The Connected Car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gage called the whitepaper the beginning of a dialogue between the ICT industry, ATIS, and car and trucks OEMs. "The whole industry needs to be secure and the whole industry needs standards," Gage added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATIS also works with the &lt;a href="https://www.automotiveisac.com/"target="new"&gt;Information Sharing and Analysis Center&lt;/a&gt; (Auto ISAC), which helps share best practices among OEMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the whitepaper finds that there is a growing need for end-to-end security, especially as OEMs write more software and then send that software, along with updates, to their fleets, whether those are commercial trucks or passenger vehicles, over networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does the software need to be written and developed securely using best practices, but vehicles need VPNs, firewalls and other technologies to ensure that the transmission of that software remains secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second significant point is securing all the different networks that work within these connected cars, including wireless, WiFi, fixed-line networks, &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=11&amp;p_id=175"target="new"&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt; and satellite technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is about stepping back and looking at the vehicle platform in its entirety and all the paths into it in the same way you would a host," said Jim McEachern, a senior technology consultant for ATIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main security threat that ATIS is looking to address is malware that can overtake an individual vehicle or even a fleet of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this type of cybersecurity approach is still fairly new, Gage said the next step is to continue talking with OEMs about these issues, along with ATIS and the whole ITC industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We expect some of those discussion will bubble up to become the beginning of industry standards and best practices," Gage said.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to describe Baidu is that it is China's version of Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Google, Baidu is known foremost as a search engine giant. About 65% of search queries in the US are from Google, while 80% of searches in China are through Baidu. (Google receives far more searches globally.) Another similarity to Google is that Baidu has products, services, technologies and ambitions that range far beyond search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

That includes, much the same as Google spinoff Waymo, developing self-driving car technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=188488&amp;amp;p=irol-irhome" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt;'s premier autonomous vehicle product is Apollo, a self-driving platform that is arguably the premier autonomous vehicle product in the world, period. Unveiled in April, the all-in-one driverless vehicle solution is an open platform, meaning that any developer can contribute (approved) additions or improvements to Apollo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, it has accrued 70 announced partners since launch. And now, it's gotten a large-scale upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 21, Baidu announced the release of Apollo 1.5, which includes five new core capabilities: obstacle perception, planning, cloud simulation, HD mapping and end-to-end deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The obstacle perception capability enables vehicles to accurately identify obstacles during both day and night," Baidu's &lt;a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/09/21/1125651/0/en/Baidu-Announces-Apollo-1-5-and-a-10-Billion-yuan-Autonomous-Driving-Fund.html" target="new"&gt;according to a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "With the planning capability, vehicles can plan the correct driving path and make optimal driving decisions. The cloud simulation system on Apollo is the only platform that provides open, built-in HD maps tailored for autonomous driving. Based on large-scale cloud computing capacity, Apollo has a vast amount of real traffic data in China, and has a virtual running capacity of one million kilometers per day."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the statement, Baidu refers to Apollo's over 70 collaborators as "strong" partners, which is an understatement to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July, it was announced that Baidu would be &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734772" target="new"&gt;teaming up with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; to use its cloud platform Azure, and the specific functionalities announced for Apollo 1.5 sure sound like they're at least partially enabled by Azure. Other partners span various industries: Daimler, Intel, Nvidia and Pioneer all stand out as big names internationally, and Baidu is also bringing a number of Chinese partners into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Baidu has signed over 50 cooperation agreements with Apollo partners on mass production or joint product development plans," according to the company's statement. "King Long, a Xiamen-based commercial vehicle manufacturer, performed autonomous waypoint driving in enclosed venues using buses deployed with Apollo's 1.0 capabilities. Momenta, a Beijing-based autonomous driving startup, successfully conducted testing on designated lanes using Apollo 1.5 enabled cars, which were able to accurately recognize obstacles, passengers, and make optimal decisions even at night when visibility is very low."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu also unveiled a new undertaking known as the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-baidu-autonomous/chinas-baidu-launches-1-5-billion-autonomous-driving-fund-idUSKCN1BW0QJ" target="new"&gt;Apollo Fund&lt;/a&gt;, a $1.5-billion endeavor through which the company plans to invest in 100 self-driving projects over the course of the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/23/automakers-accelerate-their-interest-in-startups/" target="new"&gt;a trend emerged&lt;/a&gt; of automakers launching venture capital funds to invest in self-driving startups. With autonomous ambitions as grand as any OEM, Baidu will now vie for startup shares in the same space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By virtue of being an open platform, Apollo is highly visible. And, as a company, Baidu has been far from secretive in its development of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO Robin Li &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734357" target="new"&gt;made news&lt;/a&gt; for live streaming his own (probably illegal) self-driving car ride to a conference earlier this year. But if the Apollo 1.5 platform does all it claims, the hype will clearly be well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The world is filled with stories of people who found great success in one career, pivoted to a new arena and found equal -- if not greater -- success in their new venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos made plenty of money in finance on Wall Street, but it was nothing compared to the accomplishments he has racked up since launching Amazon. Vera Wang was 40 when she started her fashion career -- she had previously been a figure skater and journalist. Michael Bloomberg went from CEO of Bloomberg LP to mayor of New York City back to CEO of Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who are blessed with intelligence, opportunity and work ethic, there's little stopping them from success in any number of fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Dyson is the inventor of the Dual Cyclone bagless vacuum cleaner, and the founder of the eponymous household appliance company Dyson. According to Business Insider, he's worth 7.8 billion ($10.3 billion) and is the &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sunday-times-rich-list-2017-richest-people-uk-britain-2017-4/#25-joe-lewis-1" target="new"&gt;14th-richest person&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. But Dyson's ambitions extend beyond vacuums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a memo distributed to Dyson employees, he has a team of 400 engineers designing an all-electric car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At this moment, we finally have the opportunity to bring all our opportunities into a single product," he wrote. "Rather than filtering emissions at the exhaust pipe, today we have the ability to solve it at the source. So I wanted you to hear it directly from me: Dyson has begun work on a battery electric vehicle, due to be launched by 2020."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/23/dyson-developing-electric-car-government-documents" target="new"&gt;first leaked&lt;/a&gt; of Dyson's electric vehicle development last year when The Guardian discovered government documents that indicated public money was helping fund the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The government is funding Dyson to develop a new battery electric vehicle at their headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. This will secure 174m of investment in the area, creating over 500 jobs, mostly in engineering," said the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/509735/NIDP_2016-2021_final_web.pdf" target="new"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;. Until now, though -- 18 months later --
 Dyson had refused to acknowledge the existence of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not exactly a career shift for James Dyson -- he is an inventor, after all -- the development of an electric car represents a significant departure from his company's current offerings. His memo struck a decidedly moralistic tone, condemning government and industry alike for knowingly advancing technology that contributed to global warming while willfully ignoring tech that could help solve the problem. He described shopping EV prototypes in the early 1990s, only to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In the period since, governments around the world have encouraged the adoption of oxymoronically designated 'clean diesel' engines through subsidies and grants," he wrote. "Major auto manufacturers have circumvented and duped clean air regulations. As a result, developed and developing cities are full of smog-belching cars, [trucks] and buses. It is a problem that others are ignoring."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Dyson has noble aims in pursuing what could be world-altering technology. But in an editorial for The Independent, Josie Cox points out several flaws in Dyson's hopes for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, while also espousing the use of ride-hailing services as an alternative means of making our roads more environmentally friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The ride-hailing market has exploded in recent years and redefined the transport industry," &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/james-dyson-electric-cars-tech-revolution-waymo-alphabet-toyota-telsa-elon-musk-a7970496.html" target="new"&gt;Cox writes&lt;/a&gt;. "Urbanization and exploding supply within the sharing economy means that our need for a personal car has become sporadic -- limited to the odd weekend trip, airport run or a late-night emergency."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what Cox fails to acknowledge is that ride-sharing and electric vehicles do not need to be mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ride-hailing drivers are behind the wheel of electric vehicles, it compounds the benefit to the planet. And if nothing else, Dyson has made a name for himself creating beautifully designed products, so it will be fascinating to see what a Dyson electric vehicle looks like.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency to talk about the self-driving car sector as a wide-open space in terms of competition because, for the most part, it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The autonomous vehicle industry is still young, and it is still too early to know what company, if any, will have the lead on designing a fully functioning, fully autonomous car. The fact that such a diverse array of companies have turned their attention to this space -- automakers, tech companies, startups -- makes it even harder to establish a hierarchy or leaderboard of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time will tell what company will be the first to produce Lidar at scale, which one will design the 3D mapping system that will be widely adopted, and what firm will be the first to get a Level 5 autonomous vehicle on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the picture becomes more clear with each passing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicle development is accelerating at a blistering rate, and 2017 feels like the first year where we've seen a consistent stream of concrete announcements on new autonomous vehicle products and initiatives instead of just vague predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for those with contacts closer to the source, the picture is even clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank analyst Rod Lache is certainly someone with those contacts, and, on September 24, Lache issued a bold proclamation on the future of one of the world's biggest automakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"GM's AV's will be ready for commercial deployment, without human drivers, much sooner than widely expected (within quarters, not years), and potentially years ahead of competitors," &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/25/gm-developing-autonomous-vehicles-at-a-fast-pace-deutsche-bank-says.html" target="new"&gt;Lache wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a note to his clients. "We believe that businesses built off of this platform will ramp much faster than is widely expected. A fast ramp could perpetuate sustainable advantages. And we believe that this will be material, even to a company of GM's size."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lache estimated that the autonomous vehicle sector could become a $7 trillion global market, with GM having the potential to possess a 17.5% market share. He projected that 2% of miles driven in 2025 will be from AV services, and that that number would balloon to 10% by 2030. He also predicted that, in American cities, 60% of households will prefer using autonomous vehicle ride-hailing or ride-sharing services to owning their own vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a massive market opportunity," he wrote. "The monetization model is recurring in nature (vs. the transactional/cyclical model that automakers live in today), and likely to receive a healthy valuation," Lache said in his investor note and raised the GM share price target from $36 up to $51.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a firm like Deutsche Bank speaks so strongly on an investment opportunity, people listen. GM's share prices rose immediately the next morning, and then topped $42 a week later on October 2, topping the stock's previous record from December 2013. Of course, if Lache's projections bear out, there will be plenty more good news to come for General Motors' shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Self-driving car enthusiasts are, by their very nature, supremely optimistic about the technology that will eventually enable fully autonomous vehicles to navigate our roads and highways. From their viewpoint, the primary barriers to large-scale autonomous vehicle adoption are technological and regulatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those evangelical early adopters who have already fully bought into the idea of a self-driving future, it's easy to overlook one very important factor: mass consumer readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of a car driving itself is still going to take a lot of people a lot of time to get used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It's not the idea of a self-driving car that worries would-be passengers, it's the possibility that &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; could be driving the car -- someone who's not in it, according to the results of a survey conducted by insurance company AIG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of consumer attitudes towards autonomous vehicles, which is based on interviews with a 1,000 consumers, found that 75% of survey respondents feared that a car with any autonomous features would be vulnerable to remote hijacking by a hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As we move from autonomous features to fully driverless vehicles, risk does not disappear--it shifts from humans to machines," Lex Baugh, president of liability and financial lines at AIG, &lt;a href="http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2017/10/03/466351.htm" target="new"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; on the survey results. "Understanding consumer perceptions of where risk with new technology ultimately resides today will help industry and insurers understand where liability may lie tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That fear of hacking likely played a role in 67% of survey respondents saying they feared their personal information -- credit card numbers, location services, private conversations recorded by microphones -- could be compromised in an autonomous vehicle. While certainly less frightening than the idea of someone taking control of a vehicle for an act of terrorism, the possibility of a data breach represents a crime that would likely be attempted with greater regularity. It also highlights a common misconception as to what types of vehicles could be vulnerable to outside attacks: It's not just autonomous vehicles that could be at risk, but all connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat these risks, automakers have put concerted effort into beefing up their cybersecurity capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, the cybersecurity conference DEF CON hosted the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735086" target="new"&gt;Car Hacking Village&lt;/a&gt;, one of many forms of outreach that the auto industry has used to make overtures to cybersecurity professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how pressing are these issues? According to hacker and &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; employee Charlie Miller, there is not an imminent time crunch, but more open sharing among companies could improve the outlook for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'd love to see... more transparency about what steps they are taking. They say they're working together, but I'd love to see academic people and researchers helping them as well. Security should not be a competitive advantage in any market, especially one that has to do with physical safety," Miller said in an &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/can-a-connected-car-ever-be-safe-from-hacking-feature" target="new"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Car and Driver. "The good news is, we're not going to have an autonomous car tomorrow or next week. Nobody knows when it's going to be, but we have time to get it right. We're in a good position now to do it."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The self-driving car industry, whether it's OEMs, tech companies, or venture capital firms, has a nearly universal faith that autonomous vehicles are coming and that, when they do, they will make life better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who work in the space day-to-day are on the receiving end of a constant stream of announcements heralding the advancements of self-driving technology. More importantly, they are likely to have seen an autonomous car work in person. And this is a case where seeing is believing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the self-driving car industry can also be guilty of operating in a bit of a bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to forget that not everyone may be quite as sold on autonomous vehicles at this moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain insight into just what exactly the average American thinks about driverless cars, the esteemed Pew Research Center conducted a study about consumer attitudes that arguably dives deeper than any of its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though "&lt;a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/10/04/americans-attitudes-toward-driverless-vehicles/" target="new"&gt;Americans' attitudes toward driverless vehicles&lt;/a&gt;" comprises only one of five sections in the "&lt;a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/10/04/automation-in-everyday-life/" target="new"&gt;Automation in Everyday Life&lt;/a&gt;" report, the insights on the topic are both wide-spanning and nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major takeaways from the survey results are that most Americans are familiar with self-driving cars and expect them to eventually become fixtures on our roads, but they are not as convinced about the viability of the current autonomous technology on roads today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the survey, 94% of respondents said they had heard about self-driving cars, while 35% had heard "a lot" about self-driving cars. Of that 35%, most were men and college graduates: 44% of men surveyed reported having heard a lot about driverless cars, while only 26% of women reported the same. Forty-three percent of college graduates had heard a lot about AVs, compared to 25% of those with high school diplomas. Most people felt that they had heard largely neutral or mixed things about autonomous vehicles, with 66% of respondents saying that they had been exposed to both positive and negative coverage on self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as timelines, 56% of those surveyed believe that most cars on the road will be driverless sometime between ten and 50 years from now. An optimistic 9% believe that point will come within the next decade, while 8% believe it will never happen at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while the opportunity to ride in a self-driving car might seem like an exciting prospect to some, the (slight) majority of Americans aren't ready to make the leap just yet: 56% of survey respondents said they would not want to take a ride in an autonomous vehicle if given the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When asked to describe in their own words why they would not be interested in riding in an autonomous vehicle, respondents overwhelmingly bring up two major and often overlapping concepts," according to the report. "Some 42% of those who would not want to ride in an autonomous vehicle express a general lack of trust in the technology or an unwillingness to cede control to a machine in a potentially life-or-death situation, while another 30% specifically mention safety concerns of one type or another."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans hold a diverse array of opinions on many topics, and, as the survey shows, autonomous vehicles are no exception. What's encouraging is that most people who are still unsure about self-driving cars are reserving judgement instead of rejecting the technology outright.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The act of leaving a company sometimes forces an employee to perform an awkward balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the employee is being brought over for his or her expertise, and is expected to use the knowledge they have acquired from their previous jobs to inform the work they do at their new one. But expectations of confidentiality -- some formal, some not -- demand that the employee avoid sharing certain information about his or her previous employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the line between what can and cannot be discussed with a new company is a blurred one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it's unclear exactly what information British technology company &lt;a href="https://www.dyson.com/" target="new"&gt;Dyson&lt;/a&gt; is accusing ex-CEO Max Conze of revealing, or to whom he revealed it, this much is known: Dyson felt that Conze was inappropriately loose-lipped when leaving the company in October after having served as the top executive since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, court filings show, Dyson is seeking compensation from Conze for breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Dyson board has decided to bring a claim against Max Conze at the high court in London in relation to his actions while chief executive, including the disclosure of confidential information and a breach of his fiduciary duties," Dyson wrote in a statement, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/15/dyson-sue-former-chief-executive-max-conze" target="new"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kaye Wiggins and Giles Turner speculate at &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-15/dyson-said-to-sue-ex-ceo-for-sharing-secrets-on-electric-car" target="new"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, there's a good chance chance that whatever secrets Conze may have spilled would likely involve Dyson's plans to develop an electric vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known as a manufacturer of upmarket household appliances, particularly vacuums, the company made waves in September when founder James Dyson announced the company's plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736850" target="new"&gt;bring EVs to market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At this moment, we finally have the opportunity to bring all our opportunities into a single product," Dyson wrote in a memo to employees. "Rather than filtering emissions at the exhaust pipe, today we have the ability to solve it at the source. So I wanted you to hear it directly from me: Dyson has begun work on a battery electric vehicle, due to be launched by 2020."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conze strongly rebuked the company's claims of wrongdoing on his part, citing Dyson's growth and success during his tenure as CEO, which he took on after 17 years with Procter &amp; Gamble. He also hinted at forthcoming allegations that he plans to make against Dyson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When I arrived from Frankfurt in 2010 Dyson sold around 5m machines. In 2016, it sold 13m and that momentum is continuing," Conze said. "This couldn't have happened without my total commitment to the business and its people. This ridiculous allegation is merely trying to distract attention from the claims that Dyson knows I am about to issue."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll likely soon hear greater details of the accusations coming from each side of this dispute. In the meantime, Dyson has shown no signs of slowing down in pursuing the electric car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company brought on former Tesla vice president Ricardo Reyes as its global chief of communications &lt;a href="https://www.teslarati.com/ex-tesla-vp-heads-dyson-new-global-chief-communications/" target="new"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If Amazon wants you to hear about something, you'll hear about it. Despite releasing no real news on the subject since an initial announcement, the company has been in the news constantly for months now thanks to its search for a second headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Amazon had to do was put out the call, and hundreds of cities across the country provided a stream of free publicity by offering enormous tax breaks or trying to lure the internet giant with creative stunts -- or both.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And who can forget the 2013 &lt;i&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/i&gt; episode when the reputable show basically turned into an infomercial for an Amazon delivery drone? It was a masterclass in marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is to say that when you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; know about something &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/rzekmvyjojcp6uc" target="new"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is doing, it's probably because the company doesn't want you to. Most often, this is because Amazon is testing something in beta, and doesn't want the public scrutinizing an unfinished product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would appear to be the case for Amazon Relay, an app designed to facilitate truck drivers' trips in and out of the company's warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First reported by Eugene Kim at &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/16/amazon-quietly-launched-an-app-called-relay-to-go-after-truck-drivers.html" target="new"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; nearly a month after it launched in October, Relay gives drivers a QR code to scan into warehouse facilities, allowing them to forego the time-consuming check-in processes that some warehouses have at their security gates. Certain warehouses have built exclusive lanes for those using Relay check-ins, calling to mind the E-ZPass system that lets drivers skip manual toll collection booths on highways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a company so obsessed with logistics, and one that relies so much on truck drivers, one might expect Amazon to already have a series of automated systems in place that economize its delivery processes down to a single turn of a truck's tire. This is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Relay is Amazon's first attempt at automating the truck delivery process, which is error-prone due to its reliance on phone calls and paperwork," Kim writes. "While Relay may have a narrow application today, it serves as the first connection point between Amazon and potentially millions of truck drivers, a job that's become one of the most common in the U.S. Amazon is reportedly looking into other services as well, including an app that would match truck drivers with cargo shippers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how completely dominant Amazon has been to this point in destroying its competitors, the idea that the company still has room to make its operations more efficient is a bit scary. The imagination quickly turns to autonomous vehicles, a field that many believe could upend the trucking industry entirely. Amazon has given that some thought, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As of right now, Amazon still envisions a human being involved with the delivery process... but the time wasted with looking at next stops or shuffling packages and other steps offers an opportunity to increase efficiencies," Dave Sullivan &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/currentaccounts/2017/04/28/amazon-self-driving-vehicles-ups-fedex/#1a9c983b3661" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; at Forbes earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, though, the Relay app will have to do for fleet managers looking for Amazon to improve their delivery operations. At least until those delivery drones become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Testing autonomous vehicles is an enormous undertaking. Designing software that can pilot a vehicle -- a massive task unto itself -- is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a physical automobile with all the necessary hardware components for autonomy is another huge hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that comes the challenge of finding a closed course to test on and then acquiring a permit to test on public roads. Of course, established companies that have spent years and millions of dollars developing autonomous vehicles have already cleared all these hurdles. And that's how it should be. No one wants their nextdoor neighbor testing a DIY AV around the neighborhood cul-de-sac. But the barrier to entry shouldn't be so high as to discourage all newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source autonomous vehicle software platforms mean that developers do not need to reinvent the wheel every single time they want to build something new and also encourage contributions from all corners of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="new"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; open-sourced AirSim, a platform for testing the artificial intelligence systems of autonomous vehicles. At launch, it was used exclusively to test aerial drone systems. Now, Microsoft has announced that AirSim will start allowing users the opportunity to test and refine driverless car systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We aim to make [the] various aspects of developing self-driving cars available to a broader group of researchers by providing an open, community-driven platform for testing those algorithms," researchers Ashish Kapoor and Shital Shah &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/autonomous-car-research/" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a post announcing the development. "The new version of AirSim includes car simulations, new environments, APIs to ease programming and ready-to-run scripts to jump start your research."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CauKo089zm0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailed 3D urban environment in AirSim has more than seven miles of drivable roads that cover the equivalent of 20 city blocks. The landscape includes things like traffic lights and construction sites, so developers can replicate real-world conditions that autonomous vehicles are likely to encounter. The entire environment can be customized to accommodate different needs and future updates may include factors such as varying weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For autonomous vehicle developers, virtual testing of systems can be just as important as real-world miles for improving their software. &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=735854&amp;piddl_msgid=261196#msg_261196/" target="new"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; recently reported on how &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; puts the brains of its driverless cars through intense learning processes without driving a single physical mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In that virtual space, they can unhitch from the limits of real life and create thousands of variations of any single scenario, and then run a digital car through all of them," Alexis Madrigal wrote. "As the driving software improves, it's downloaded back into the physical cars, which can drive more and harder miles, and the loop begins again."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The faster that loop gets recycled, whether it's on a Microsoft platform or a Google one or some other yet-to-be-developed software, the faster autonomous vehicles will be ready to take the road at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;On a self-driving car, each individual sensor serves a very specific function. Those distinct functions come together to give an autonomous vehicle a clear picture of its surroundings so that it can interpret its environment and make decisions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each sensor has a job to do, the most important sensor for the overwhelming majority of driverless vehicles currently in development is Lidar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every second, Lidar sensors send out millions of laser pulses, which bounce off of surrounding objects back to the physical sensor. The time it takes for each pulse to return to the Lidar informs a driverless car's software of the composition of its immediate environment -- the shape of surrounding objects, their distance from the vehicle, and the speed at which they're traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt; has been a leader in designing and manufacturing Lidar systems for autonomous vehicles since the industry first began to take shape a decade ago. Like all of the distinct technologies in a driverless car, Lidar technology improved dramatically over time, much of that spurred on by developments at Velodyne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late November, Velodyne continued its innovative approach and announced its latest Lidar product for autonomous vehicles, the VLS-128.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Velodyne VLS-128 is an all-out assault on high-performance LiDAR for autonomous vehicles," Velodyne founder and CEO David Hall wrote in a &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171129005475/en/Velodyne-Demonstrates-Quantum-Leap-LiDAR-Technology" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, "With this product, we are redefining the limits of LiDAR and we will be able to see things no one has ever been able to see with this technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VLS-128 succeeds Velodyne's HDL-64 as the company's top-of-the-line sensor. The VLS-128 features, as its name implies, 128 laser channels, which is twice as many as its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

{image 1}

&lt;p&gt;Velodyne says that its new Lidar creates a much higher resolution picture and side-by-side pictures of the VLS-128 and HDL-64 support that claim. Because of the increased processing power in the VLS-128, it can detect items faster, and thus avoid collision better, than competitive Lidar, even at increased rates of speed as would be found on a highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of the VLS-128 has yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HDL-64 cost $70,000 when first brought to market. Given the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;widespread belief&lt;/a&gt; that the high cost of Lidar is among the foremost factors limiting the production of self-driving cars at scale, the cost of the VLS-128 will figure significantly into how it is received by the AV industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 2017 marking the ten-year anniversary of the DARPA Urban Challenge -- a competition that helped spur the development of autonomous vehicles across the United States -- Hall has been the subject of quite a few retrospectives this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While his team didn't win the Challenge, his innovation of a rotating Lidar sensor was duplicated far and wide in the years after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was a groundbreaking design, one that Hall patented in 2007, that meant you could not only see and avoid obstacles, you could localize yourself on a real-time map, allowing for navigation, even if you lost GPS," Ben Popper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16491052/velodyne-lidar-mapping-self-driving-car-david-hall-interview" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; for The Verge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the VLS-128, Hall hopes he has another groundbreaking design on his hands. The new Lidars will be produced at Velodyne's new factory in San Jose, and the company plans to begin shipping the sensors by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There's a reason there are consumer autonomous systems already being rolled out for highway driving without an equivalent for city driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cars on a highway behave rationally for the most part, which makes it easier for the artificial intelligence that controls an autonomous system to operate since it is programmed logically. In a city, the density of vehicles is much higher, which leaves less margin for error than on a highway. There are also far more irrational actors, such as pedestrians and cyclists, whose movements cannot be predicted with great accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can force an autonomous system to react much quicker than it is capable of doing currently, and the reaction may not always be the right one. The level of artificial intelligence necessary to operate a driverless car in rush hour city traffic is higher by an order of magnitude compared to highway driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For autonomous vehicle developers, this type of AI challenge is to be welcomed, not avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating out of San Francisco, &lt;a href="http://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; self-driving subsidiary &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; has aggressively tested its driverless vehicles in complicated urban settings for quite some time. According to &lt;a href="https://www.gm.com/content/dam/gm/events/docs/5265893-685163-Chartset-11-30-2017" target="new"&gt;a slideshow&lt;/a&gt; released on the company's website in advance of an investor presentation in late November, the company is scaling up its efforts in cities by launching a commercial AV service in "dense urban environments" starting in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation imagines a future with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero traffic congestion. It is relentlessly optimistic, and positions GM as a leader in autonomy and the "only fully integrated developer of AVs with true scale ability."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons GM puts forward for its AV superiority range from big-name hires to impending technological breakthroughs. On the talent front, GM has recruited former Uber engineer AG Gandgadhar as the first ever CTO of Cruise, former Netflix executive Tawni Cranz as its new chief HR officer, and former Google Maps program manager Ashwin Prabhu as head of mapping operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the tech front, GM says its Lidar developments are game-changing. While currently available Lidar systems are described as having quality issues and a $20,000 price tag, Cruise claims its &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737289" target="new"&gt;acquisition of Strobe&lt;/a&gt; will enable it to manufacture a Lidar system that is more than twice as effective as current products at a cost of only $300 per unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt published a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/why-testing-self-driving-cars-in-sf-is-challenging-but-necessary-77dbe8345927" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; underlining the philosophy that drives his company to pursue deployment in urban environments specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our path to scale starts with fleet deployments in the most dense urban environments, where high utilization rates generate sustainable unit economics even at low initial vehicle volumes," Vogt wrote. "As we ramp up volume, we'll drive down costs and gradually roll out our technology to suburban and rural areas where ride sharing is less common today. It takes scale in order to reach these areas and achieve a significant impact on society, so for us anything less than that is failure (and probably an unsustainable business)."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no mention of which cities Cruise would be expanding into. Wherever they end up, those cities will instantly become autonomous hubs, which could lead to a network effect that creates even faster innovation in the category.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The position of legacy automakers is not as secure as it once was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impending arrival of self-driving cars has opened up the market, allowing major tech companies and startups to infiltrate an industry that once was the exclusive domain of OEMs. It's not totally infeasible that Google spinoff Waymo could become the leading American automaker in the second half of this century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, legacy automakers still have an opportunity to expand their business. As the fleets of vehicles used for ride-sharing and ride-hailing services grow, no one is in a better position to produce the vehicles for those fleets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the approach being adopted by &lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/" target="new"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than acting defensively, Toyota made clear its intentions to be a player in the fleet space at CES in January.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automaker introduced the e-Palette concept vehicle as a collaborative effort with Uber, Amazon, Mazda, Pizza Hut and ride-hailing company Didi. As the diversity of those partners suggests, e-Palette is a broad, ambitious concept that would aim to position Toyota at the center of a transformation in transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The automobile industry is clearly amidst its most dramatic period of change as technologies like electrification, connected and automated driving are making significant progress," Toyota president Akio Toyoda noted in a &lt;a href="http://pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+launches+new+mobility+ecosystem+concept+vehicle+2018+ces.htm" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Toyota remains committed to making ever better cars. Just as important, we are developing mobility solutions to help everyone enjoy their lives... This announcement marks a major step forward in our evolution towards sustainable mobility, demonstrating our continued expansion beyond traditional cars and trucks to the creation of new values including services for customers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The e-Palette concept is fully autonomous and fully electric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to offer an open-source platform for third parties to customize the vehicles to suit their exact needs. The vehicles are designed to be appealing to all types of fleet managers, whether it be those shuttling humans -- Uber and Didi -- or those shuttling goods, such as Amazon and Pizza Hut. Digital renderings of the vehicle from Toyota show other uses, as well: Mobile stores, restaurants and work spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has become customary for autonomous concept vehicles, the e-Palette features a unique, quirky design. But the boxy-with-rounded-edges design is not whimsical for whimsy's sake. A barrier-free interior with a low floor allows for maximum space in the cabin, enabling a wide variety of possible uses. The concept includes three different lengths of e-Palette, which Toyota says could allow for a space large enough to serve as a hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept was the recipient of the inaugural &lt;a href="https://www.edmunds.com/" target="new"&gt;Edmunds&lt;/a&gt; CES Tech Driven Hackmotive Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Buzzwords like future mobility and autonomy reverberate throughout the show floor at CES, but Toyota's innovative e-Palette concept stands out from the crowd thanks to its near-term implementation, established partnerships and visionary execution," Edmunds editor-in-chief Alistair Weaver wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyota-e-palette-concept-wins-inaugural-edmunds-ces-tech-driven-hackomotive-award-at-ces-2018-300581014.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The e-Palette concept vehicle embraces the transformative ideals of the Hackomotive Award and has real potential to help usher in a new era of transportation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While its design may be different from what we see on our roads today, the versatility of the e-Palette could make it a hit among fleet owners with vehicles performing a variety of duties, and its roomy cabin could make it a hit among passengers, too.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) group released the non-standalone (NSA) 5G radio specifications, the first official standard for 5G networks. This also includes an anchor for LTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1930-sys_architecture"target="new"&gt;A standalone standard&lt;/a&gt; (Release 15) for 5G is expected in June, according to &lt;a href="http://www.3gpp.org/"target="new"&gt;3GPP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the world has the new generation of connectivity in place and all cars and vehicles are equipped with Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies -- something that should happen by 2025 -- common sights on the road today, such as traffic lights and posted speed limits, will become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial standards for Cellular V2X have been agreed to under the 3GPP Release 14, and called "LTE support for V2X." Commercial roll out is expected to commence this year.&lt;/p&gt; 

{Image 1}

&lt;p&gt;Some services will appear at the Winter Olympics as South Korea's KT Telecom plans to have a 5G commercial network ready for the Pyeongchang Games in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one issue that most industry stakeholders agree, as they confirmed in several sessions during Mobile World Congress 2017, is that 5G is not initially a technology for people's handsets, but rather a way to connect the more than 20 billion devices that will be present by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of 5G standards opens the way for vehicles to be equipped with advanced technologies that require the security, performance and low latency of the new networks.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;In September 2016, car manufacturers and mobile technology players created the "&lt;a href="https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1330525"target="new"&gt;5G Automotive Association&lt;/a&gt;" to develop new offerings for autonomous vehicles using connected technologies, such as Cellular Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) communication. And the new connected cars, equipped with Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and V2X technologies, are expected to pack in around &lt;a href="https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;doc_id=1331919"target="new"&gt;$6,000 of electronics by 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GSMA, which sponsors MWC, &lt;a href="https://www.gsma.com/iot/news/road-5g-rise-connected-cars/"target="new"&gt;predicted last year&lt;/a&gt; that annual sales of connections for automobiles will reach 91-million units by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits are enormous, especially in reducing accident-related deaths and injuries. For example, the In-Vehicle Speed Limit Signaling could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847811000325"target="new"&gt;potentially reduce deaths&lt;/a&gt; by 15% and injuries by another 8%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic flow will be improved as navigation systems and apps can use the virtual network of vehicles to determine the flow of traffic and divert drivers to different routes to avoid congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5G will also be key to launching fully autonomous vehicles. While the buzz about self-driving cars has subsided a bit last year, research continues at full speed. 5G connectivity is one of the key components to launch autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting advantages of connected cars using 5G is the potential launch of virtual cloud networks linking the vehicles in one area. The upcoming 5G networks will need a large number of cells to perform, as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency"target="new"&gt;mm-wave frequencies&lt;/a&gt; limit the range of transmission -- unless you want to stick your head in a massive microwave oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of cars can become the carriers, connectors, and on-the-fly storage for 5G infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security, obviously, is one of the main concerns. A network of highly-connected vehicles needs to be protected against hackers and other threats, such as network failures and natural disasters. That's why the &lt;a href="https://5g-ppp.eu/"target="new"&gt;European 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership&lt;/a&gt; (5GPPP) has been working simultaneously on 5G development and security implementation.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://5gensure.eu/sites/default/files/5G%20PPP_White%20Paper_Phase%201%20Security%20Landscape_June%202017.pdf"target="new"&gt;paper published&lt;/a&gt; in June, the 5GPPP encourages its members to agree on several security technologies, such as Network Slicing, Microsegmentation, Strong Isolation, MTC Space and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members have identified the 555G PPP security landscape and privacy as a 5G enabler and essential value proposition supporting the principle of privacy by design.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The autonomous vehicle industry is facing a worker shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical skills required to be a driverless car engineer are extensive and advanced, and there is generally a greater demand for workers than there is supply.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since self-driving car technology is so new, few engineers have had the time to acquire the skill set required to jump right in. But for those workers that are qualified, the benefits can be immense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the companies developing autonomous technology have received major injections of capital, so they have the cash to pay to employees that meet a very specific set of criteria. That's why getting workers trained in the skills they will need has become such an important aspect of the race to get driverless cars on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CES, Chinese tech giant and autonomous vehicle developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/baidu_inc?lang=en" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; announced a bold and innovative strategy to not only expand the driverless engineer workforce overall, but also to assist in Baidu's own pursuit of talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu revealed that it had partnered with tech education company &lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="new"&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt; to build an online course dedicated solely to training workers to build and develop on Apollo, Baidu's open-source autonomous driving platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udacity, founded and led by driverless vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738354" target="new"&gt;pioneer&lt;/a&gt; Sebastian Thrun, offers so-called "nanodegree" programs online for aspiring workers in fields like data analysis, virtual reality development and digital marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Thrun's background, though, the company is best known for its courses that train engineers to work in autonomous vehicle design and development. According to Udacity head of self-driving cars David Silver, the Apollo course will be the first of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program is an intense nine-month journey to becoming a self-driving car engineer, and it offers an amazing learning experience, but it is for advanced engineers," Silver wrote in a Medium &lt;a href="https://medium.com/udacity/udacity-and-baidus-new-course-introduction-to-apollo-4eb244313e8c" target="new"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. "And while our Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree program is an excellent point-of-entry for aspiring learners newer to the field, it offers an equally immersive experience. This course offers adds something new and important to the range of learning options."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various companies are working to develop proprietary self-driving car platforms that they hope will become the universal standard going forward, Apollo is arguably the best known platform in the industry that is already in development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu has an unparalleled list of partners who are helping develop Apollo, a roster that includes &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739493" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739564" target="new"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734772" target="new"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu has always been an open source platform, but this education outreach through Udacity figures to help the company attract a greater number of Apollo contributors beyond its official partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu is not the only company working on autonomous vehicles that has teamed up with Udacity to offer educational opportunities. &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736597" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; is funding 400 scholarships for students to complete driverless car courses through the service, and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738498" target="new"&gt;Infosys&lt;/a&gt; contracted with Udacity to broaden its own engineers' knowledge in self-driving tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is the first time that Udacity has built an entire course tailored to one company's proprietary technology. And having more workers trained in its platform, gives Baidu yet another advantage in its quest to create the new industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to comprehend the vast amount of data generated by today's automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engine, driving and braking systems that have always been integral components to cars are now part of computerized systems that quite literally track your every move on the road. Modern technologies that are now common parts of our driving experiences, such as navigation systems and music streaming services, generate data that offer valuable insight into consumer habits. And the car of tomorrow? It could very well be keeping track of your heart rate and body temperature, not to mention more abstract factors like your mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a day and age where companies like Target have invested millions to figure out how to leverage data to determine, among other things, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html" target="new"&gt;when customers are pregnant&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly every point of an individual's interaction with the world is mined for data. Internet browsing, cell phone activity and credit card usage are all sources through which data can be collected and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can imagine, then, how data generated from a connected car has come to be regarded as highly valuable. To put a "data point" on just how valuable, a 2016 &lt;a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/monetizing-car-data" target="new"&gt;report by McKinsey&lt;/a&gt; estimates that connected car data could generate between $450 to $750 billion in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Artificial intelligence and big data will make vehicles one of the most important windows into the habits of consumers next to their own phones and computers," Edmunds.com Executive Editor Ed Hellwig, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/01/06/ces-2017-your-car-wants-to-say-hello-and-thats-only-the-start/?utm_term=.92caf1ec0fbf" target="new"&gt;told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; in January. "Automakers will know more than they ever have about how their vehicles are used, which could lead to entirely new designs and features."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are designing connected cars -- a group that includes many non-traditional automakers -- are certainly hoping so. For the OEMs, a substantial secondary revenue stream other than sales would help bolster an industry that could best be described as "embattled" in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to gather and synthesize data that is meaningful and valuable to third parties, connected car manufacturers must first have significant technological infrastructure in place. &lt;a href="https://www.fordpass.com/en_us/home.html" target="new"&gt;Ford Pass&lt;/a&gt; and GM's &lt;a href="https://www.onstar.com/us/en/services/navigation/AtYourService.html" target="new"&gt;OnStar AtYourService&lt;/a&gt; are both platforms that legacy automakers use to improve the experience of their drivers (and sell their data). But if a single data platform were to be used across the industry, it would improve accessibility and make it much easier for data buyers to know exactly what they were getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts to create just that are underway. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://otonomo.io/" target="new"&gt;Otonomo&lt;/a&gt; raised $25 million &lt;a href="https://www.pehub.com/2017/04/otonomo-nabs-25-mln-series-b/" target="new"&gt;in a Series B round&lt;/a&gt; of fundraising. The company offers a platform that "enables car manufacturers, service providers and application developers to safely exchange car-generated data for a better connected-car experience," according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everybody wants car data," &lt;a href="http://www.pymnts.com/big-data/2017/otonomo-ceo-ben-volkow-on-making-connected-car-data-monetizable/" target="new"&gt;said Otonomo CEO Ben Volkow&lt;/a&gt;. "We want to move from the age of data mobilization to the age of data monetization. But in order for connected cars to really take off and provide the kind of useful data that's worth monetizing, car manufacturers need a platform they trust to share and negotiate data between them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether a single platform is necessary to optimize the marketplace for data from connected cars remains to be seen. Perhaps a single platform will never take hold and we'll never find out. But, at this point, the exact shape of the forthcoming connected car data explosion almost seems besides the point. With the amount of money out there for those able to provide this data, it's going to be figured out one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There's no atmosphere quite like that of a college campus. Students lazily tossing Frisbees across the manicured quad. Tens of thousands of fans cheering on their school's football team in an enormous stadium. Procrastinators hunkered down in the library with buckets of coffee at all hours of the night. State-of-the art driverless shuttles giving visitors self-guided tours of the university's facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that last bit may seem a bit out of place at first. But, if the University of Michigan's flourishing partnership with French company &lt;a href="http://navya.tech/" target="new"&gt;Navya&lt;/a&gt; is any indication, autonomous shuttles could become a staple of college campuses -- and plenty of other settings -- in the not-too-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/07/u-m_opens_32-acre_autonomous_connected_vehicles_mcity.html" target="new"&gt;the university opened MCity&lt;/a&gt;, an on-campus test site for connected and driverless cars. In June, Michigan announced that two electric, fully automated shuttles made by Navya would break free from the testing grounds during the upcoming fall semester to shuttle members of the university community between its engineering school and its North Campus Research Complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Navya has revealed &lt;a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2017/06/driverless_shuttles_arent_just.html" target="new"&gt;plans to open an assembly plant&lt;/a&gt; to produce more of the shuttles in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That latest announcement was made at MCity, as representatives from Navya joined administrators and researchers from the University of Michigan to describe the plan going forward for the new shuttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant is being built in Saline, Mich., which is about ten miles from the university campus in Ann Arbor. It will be a large facility, taking up 20,000 square feet. Three people have already been hired for the new production facility, including a plant manager, and 12 more employees will be brought in to staff the operation, The facility won't operate like a traditional auto plant, according to Navya Vice President of Sales Henri Caron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are not a car manufacturer," he told Michigan Live. "We are an assembly plant ... connecting to our technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P0cH9WIQwt8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While only two of its electric, 15-person ARMA buses will be active in Ann Arbor this fall, Navya plans to build 20 more by the end of the year at its new facility. Some of them will likely stay local to service to the University, while others may be sent to customers out of state. The two shuttles that will operate this year cost the University about $500,000, money that it received from industry partners in exchange for research access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today we are concentrating on Michigan, but we already have customers in Nevada," Caron said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any company looking to test or operate self-driving vehicles, not just Navya, Michigan is a natural place to start. The state &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2016/12/09/michigan-self-driving-cars/" target="new"&gt;legalized autonomous vehicles on public roads&lt;/a&gt; at the end of last year and passed measures with the express intention of making the state more welcoming than even California for AV testers and manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a savvy move -- albeit something of a no-brainer -- for a state whose economy relies heavily on automotive manufacturing. After stagnation in the sector effectively spelled ruin for Detroit and other Michigan locales, the revitalization of the car industry through AV technology is an exciting opportunity for The Wolverine State to get back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Democratic and Republican lawmakers on the House Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection voted unanimously to approve a bill that would allow for far more autonomous vehicles on roads across the country in the very near future. Leading up to the vote, it's likely that many lawmakers heard radio ads encouraging them to back the measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the source of the ad was neither the large corporations developing self-driving cars, nor the lobbies that represent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the National Federation of the Blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radio spots were the continuation of a trend of organizations that represent disabled people &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-19/blind-drivers-step-up-to-shape-u-s-push-for-driverless-cars" target="new"&gt;advocating for government assistance in accelerating the development of self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;. It's easy to understand why: self-driving cars would mean far greater freedom for the elderly, blind and other disabled individuals who are unable to drive themselves.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with disabilities wouldn't have to rely on others for trips to the grocery store or the doctor or to visit friends and relatives. Their quality of life would stand to improve drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Autonomous vehicles will be transformative for people who are blind," Dave Power, president and CEO of Perkins School for the Blind in Boston, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602555/the-blind-community-has-high-hopes-for-self-driving-cars/" target="new"&gt;told The MIT Technology Review&lt;/a&gt; last year. "For the first time, they will be able to get to school, work, and community activities independently, regardless of distance. There is tremendous enthusiasm about it, both here and nationally, among the blind."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That enthusiasm has been heard loud and clear, thanks largely in part to the National Federation of the Blind and other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ultimate purpose of the National Federation of the Blind is the complete integration of the blind into society on a basis of equality," states the &lt;a href="https://nfb.org/"target="new"&gt;NFB's website&lt;/a&gt;. "This objective involves the removal of legal, economic, and social discriminations; the education of the public to new concepts concerning blindness; and the achievement by all blind people of the right to exercise to the fullest their individual talents and capacities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ArYTxDZzQOM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help achieve those goals with regards to self-driving cars, the NFB has joined the &lt;a href="http://www.selfdrivingcoalition.org/" target="new"&gt;Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets&lt;/a&gt;. The Coalition was founded by Ford, Volvo, Uber, Waymo and Lyft -- a group of competitors with a shared interest in clearing the way for self-driving cars to take the road. Since April 2016, the Coalition has touted the societal benefits of autonomous vehicles to help sway the public and legislators towards favorable perception and policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick look at &lt;a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF17/20170719/106309/BILLS-115pih-HighlyAutomatedVehicleTesti-U2.pdf" target="new"&gt;the bill passed on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, July 19 shows that they've been tremendously successful. The bill seeks to establish a "Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council," for which it describes eight different duties and committees, addressing cybersecurity, labor issues and environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility, however, gets top billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two duties are regarding "advancing mobility access for the disabled community," and "mobility access for senior citizens and populations underserved by traditional public transportation services."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, there's an element of self-interest involved in self-driving car manufacturers appealing to the social benefits of their products. But if business is booming for those designing and producing self-driving car technology, it likely means that some of the most vulnerable populations in American communities are benefiting as a result. That's a win-win outcome that everyone can get behind.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The sights drivers take in while driving are so unremarkable that they are forgotten almost instantly, or perhaps don't even register them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even obstacles that force us to slightly adjust course are considered routine: a car parked on the side of the road, highway construction reducing traffic to a single lane or a detour sign telling us we have to take the long way to the supermarket. (Okay, that last one could be a day-ruiner.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For designers developing self-driving cars, though, figuring out how to program autonomous vehicles to recognize and effectively navigate environmental irregularities is one of the greatest challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For former Tesla employees Erik Reed and Andrew Kouri -- as well as George Tall, who worked for iRobot -- it was a challenge they wanted to face head on. To do so, the trio founded mapping startup &lt;a href="https://lvl5.ai/" target="new"&gt;Lvl5&lt;/a&gt; in December and publicly launched the company in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The thing that everyone is kind of ignoring silently is that self-driving cars won't ship unless we have really good HD maps that update every single day," Kouri &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/19/16000272/lvl5-self-driving-car-tesla-map-lidar" target="new"&gt;told The Verge&lt;/a&gt;. "And nobody has a system to do this yet. This is what we're building."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lvl5 is creating a system of three-dimensional, high-definition maps that the founders hope will become the baseline for self-driving cars navigating on public roads. In fact, they believe their maps can become a full-on replacement for Light Detection and Radar (LIDAR) systems -- the hardware that allows self-driving cars to "see" their surroundings in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lvl5 team believes that the cost of LIDAR is prohibitive and supply is too low for autonomous vehicles relying on it to be built at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, cars need to be ready to accelerate, brake or perform any other maneuver at a moment's notice. Lvl5's solution is to utilize cameras -- both to generate the map and to give individual cars a reading of their surroundings in real time. From the company's perspective, those things aren't all that different from one another, as crowdsourced footage from all active cameras on the road would establish live, constantly updating maps to serve as a navigational baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We fuse all that data together, and once we get a certain amount of passes on that road, we can start making maps on that road," &lt;a href="http://jalopnik.com/meet-the-former-tesla-engineers-who-want-to-fix-self-dr-1797059589" target="new"&gt;Kouri told Jalopnik&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it sounds like an ambitious project, which would require vast amounts of data from many drivers to work, that's because it is. But Lvl5 is already actively addressing that problem, and its solution is paying off for drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payver is a smartphone app developed by Lvl 5 that allows drivers to record the road by mounting phones on their windshields. The app sends the footage to the company, which integrates the images with GPS data to build Lvl5's 3D maps. For drivers, the incentive is a payment of one to five cents for each mile of footage. More than 2,000 drivers -- many of whom are Uber and Lyft drivers seeking to make their driving even more profitable -- have already started to use the app in the three months since it launched, and &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/19/technology/business/rideshare-drivers-camera/index.html" target="new"&gt;the publicity that Lvl5 has received&lt;/a&gt; should elevate that number quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Kouri told The Verge, "We don't really care if LIDAR wins out or computer vision wins out," it's clear that Lvl5's success hinges on computer vision prevailing or, at least, becoming a viable alternative to LIDAR for self-driving cars. That is still a big unknown, but given the founding team's impressive background, it's not hard to imagine them pulling it off.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The origin story of OnStar is, fundamentally, one of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 years ago, General Motors teamed with Electronic Data Systems and Hughes Electronic Corporation to develop an in-vehicle tool that would offer unmatched safety, communication and entertainment features. GM, obviously, brought all things vehicle-related to the table. EDS provided systems development and information management, and Hughes provided the satellite technology that would serve as OnStar's foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM introduced OnStar in 1996 and began incorporating it into its vehicles in 1997. It has been a signature part of many GM cars ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That spirit of collaboration remains at &lt;a href="https://www.onstar.com/us/en/home.html" target="new"&gt;OnStar&lt;/a&gt; today, as &lt;a href="https://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170724005945/en/Globetouch-Verizon-Telematics-Work-General-Motors-OnStar" target="new"&gt;announced that it was partnering&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.verizontelematics.com/" target="new"&gt;Verizon Telematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.globetouch.com/" target="new"&gt;Globetouch&lt;/a&gt; to expand OnStar's presence in automobiles around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with OnStar's original triumvirate, these new partnerships see each participant bringing something different to the table. Verizon provides the global networks that OnStar will need to work at scale in various regions, while Globetouch provides connectivity capabilities and expertise on regulatory compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Globetouch will offer GM its open GControl platform for integration with OnStar. Globetouch &lt;a href="http://www.globetouch.com/products/gcontrol/" target="new"&gt;considers GControl to be&lt;/a&gt; "the critical component at the heart of the Globetouch IoT offering." It allows for strong and secure connectivity within 4G/LTE networks. It also provides real-time analytics generated from user data that the platform collects. Verizon Ventures is one of Globetouch's backers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are working directly with Verizon Telematics to take the complexity out of carrier and agreement management, enabling Globetouch to focus on building custom solutions that fit the needs of automotive OEMs around the world," said Globetouch CEO Riccardo Di Blasio wrote a statement. "By providing a single point of integration for GM and other automotive OEMs, Globetouch ensures a world-class experience for end customers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon Telematics offers a vast array of products and services for connected cars worldwide, ranging from security features like stolen vehicle location assistance to connectivity offerings like in-car WiFi. OnStar can take advantage of all aspects through this new partnership. Especially critical is Verizon's &lt;a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/wcms/overlays/international-travel-coverage-map.html" target="new"&gt;enormous global LTE network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Verizon Telematics brings the reliability and scalability of its global network, plus decades of experience enabling built-in connectivity for automotive OEM leaders," Susan Heystee, senior vice president of OEM at Verizon Telematics, wrote in a statement. "Through this partnership with Globetouch, we make it easy for automotive OEM's customers around the globe to stay connected to what's important to them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The solution ties together the networks from multiple carriers into a single solution for GM," Mike Peterson, vice president of OEM at Verizon Telematics, &lt;a href="http://www.telecompetitor.com/verizon-general-motors-connected-car-deal-is-about-global-connectivity/" target=new"&gt;told Telecompetitor&lt;/a&gt;. "Verizon is assisting Globetouch in their global implementation for GM, and is collaborating with Globetouch on a global wireless solution for its Telematics and IoT customers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a 20-plus year head start and its ability to recruit partners that continually strengthen the network, it appears that OnStar is going to remain a market leader for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The story of industry in the US is one of collaboration, cooperation and goodwill among competing companies. Enterprises have balked at the idea of relentlessly pursuing patents, instead opting to fully share revelatory discoveries with other players in their industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than pursuing monopolization through vertical or horizontal integration, businesses have made conscious efforts to allow room for a large number of companies to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so we're being a little facetious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, competition -- not cooperation -- has been the driving force in the history of American industry. Few businesspeople would have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the young self-driving car sector begins to mature, some are concerned that the race to patent every single relevant technology will leave each company with, yes, their own exclusive tech, but also a few missing pieces of the puzzle when it comes to designing a fully autonomous vehicle. This dynamic hasn't been much of a concern with technologies such as high-definition televisions or smartwatches. But since experts predict that many lives will be saved when our roads are full of self-driving cars, the stunted development of the technology amounts to the maintenance of a deadly status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the highest-profile example of a patent lawsuit in the autonomous vehicle space &lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/4/6/15194322/waymo-uber-lawsuit-self-driving-lidar-anthony-levandowski-injunction" target="new"&gt;is the one between&lt;/a&gt; Alphabet's &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/pittsburgh/self-driving-ubers/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involves Anthony Levandowski, who worked at Waymo -- then simply known as Google's self-driving car division -- until January 2016, when he left to launch self-driving truck startup Otto. Otto has since been acquired by Uber, and Levandowski is a key leader in the company's autonomous vehicle efforts. But Waymo called foul: His ex-employer claims that Levandowski illegally stole 14,000 confidential files on his way out the door and has since used them to develop technology at Otto and Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This would essentially be a warning to others thinking about using Google-based technology: 'Use it and we will crush you in court too,'" NYU Law professor Jeanne Fromer &lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/news/a27480/patent-wars-self-driving-car/" target="new"&gt;told Popular Mechanics&lt;/a&gt;. "The implication, in this case, is that everybody will be blocked from building the best version of the product being developed unless all participants play well together, thus stifling innovation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a certain degree, the market mechanisms that would bring about such "stifling" are natural, inevitable and good. A company that is the first to successfully design technology for a new product deserves to profit from its innovation. To eliminate the possibility of patenting one's own technology would clearly disincentivize innovation. But it's not so black and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a21181/greatest-american-invention/" target="new"&gt;The US Patent and Trademark Office&lt;/a&gt; controls the degree to which certain products and their individual parts get patented. If things get too granular, autonomous vehicle developers could be hamstrung if essential self-driving car parts are each patented by different owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the amount of collaboration already present in the autonomous vehicle space indicates that companies realize the self-driving car is a problem that no individual company can tackle alone. High-profile partnerships between companies like &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-daimler-bosch-selfdriving-idUSKBN1760SJ" target="new"&gt;Daimler and Bosch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734772" target="new"&gt;Baidu and Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/27/15878900/volvo-nvidia-self-driving-car-partnership" target="new"&gt;Nvidia and Volvo&lt;/a&gt; ensure that powerful blocks of developers -- not just the little guys -- will be interested in the open flow of technology. That would be the outcome that would benefit the largest number of businesses, and certainly consumers, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When Audi introduced its latest A8 in Barcelona this July, it immediately became one of the most advanced cars on the consumer market in terms of autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the first production vehicle to feature Level 3 autonomy, which means the vehicle will be able to drive itself entirely for certain portions of a trip, according to the auto maker. The new A8 comes equipped with a feature known as "AI traffic jam pilot" that allows an equipped car to drive itself at speeds up to 37 mph in stop-and-start highway traffic. Incorporating Lidar sensors, radar systems, cameras and ultrasonic sensors, it certainly looks like the full AV package that we've been expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long before AV technology was ever viable in any capacity, a theoretical question has existed about responsibility and liability in the case of an accident involving a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a pioneer in coming to market with a semi-autonomous consumer vehicle, &lt;a href="http://www.audi.com/en.html" target="new"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt; has taken it upon itself to answer this question, at least in the case of its own cars. If a driver gets into an accident when using AI traffic jam pilot in an appropriate instance and the fault of the accident is considered to be that of the A8, Audi will accept liability for the crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When the function is operated as intended, if the customer turns the traffic jam pilot on and uses it as intended, and the car was in control at the time of the accident, the driver goes to his insurance company and the insurance company will compensate the victims of the accident and in the aftermath they come to us and we have to pay them," Thorsten Leonhardt, Audi's head of pre-development of automated driving, &lt;a href="http://www.caradvice.com.au/582380/audi-to-take-full-responsibility-in-event-of-autonomous-vehicle-crash/" target="new"&gt;told CarAdvice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the emphasis here on the word "intended."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry is at a point where several vehicles on the market have autonomous features of various types, such as Tesla's Autopilot or the self-parking option available from a variety of manufacturers. The market, however, is not at the point where cars can completely drive themselves. There's ample opportunity for users to misunderstand the limits of the AV features on their cars, and therefore misuse them. Audi clearly wants users to know that AI traffic jam pilot is not an excuse to doze off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-liable-driverless-car-crashes-2016-10" target="new"&gt;Tesla made headlines&lt;/a&gt; around this time last year for saying that it would not be liable for crashes by its AV system, it was, in effect, outlining the same level of responsibility that Audi recently claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No, I think that would be up to the individual's insurance," Elon Musk said at the time about the possibility of a Tesla crash involving Autopilot. "If it is something endemic to our design, certainly we would take our responsibility for that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as Audi's adoption of responsibility, it seems like a necessary caveat that an automaker needs to make when putting AV tech to market. It probably will not, however, move the needle on sales of the A8 one way or another. After all, consumers aren't so much concerned with what will happen in the aftermath of an accident, but they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; concerned with the ability of an AV to prevent accidents from occurring in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Samsung is placing a $300 million bet on the connected car and autonomous vehicle market, and looking to influence the types of technologies used to power them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 14, &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-expands-commitment-to-autonomous-driving-technology?utm_source=subkv&amp;CID=AFL-hq-mul-0813-11000279"target="new"&gt;Samsung announced&lt;/a&gt; the creation of its $300 million Automotive Innovation Fund, as the company plans to invest in a host of technologies for the autonomous and connected car market including smart sensors, machine vision, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, connectivity, automotive-grade safety, as well as security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Harman, which &lt;a href="https://www.informationweek.com/iot/samsungs-$8-billion-harman-deal-drives-new-era-for-it-pros-/a/d-id/1327489"target="new"&gt;Samsung acquired&lt;/a&gt; about a year ago for $8 billion, has created its own Autonomous/ADAS Strategic Business Unit. This new unit will work with Samsung's own Strategy and Innovation Center to develop smart machines and other Internet of Things devices designed to make connected cars safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Autonomous/ADAS Strategic Business Unit and automotive fund reflect the company's commitment to the values of open innovation and collaboration," Young Sohn, president and chief strategy officer of Samsung Electronics and chairman of Harman, wrote in a statement. "In partnership with OEMs and startups, we will make the driver and passenger experience safer, more convenient, and more enjoyable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that Samsung is getting involved in the connected car and autonomous vehicle market is not surprising. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=735756"target="new"&gt;Gartner survey&lt;/a&gt; found that of more than 1,500 US and German drivers, about 45% reported that they would be open to a riding in an autonomous vehicle. Although the majority are still hesitant, the gap between the two is closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung is also taking a page from its smartphone rival Apple. Although the company started out wanting to design its own connected or electric car -- the elusive &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=735700"target="new"&gt;Titan project&lt;/a&gt; -- it now seems that &lt;a href="http://www.enterprisecloudnews.com/author.asp?section_id=571&amp;doc_id=733689"target="new"&gt;Apple wants&lt;/a&gt;
to get more involved in the technology that is implemented within these vehicles, including artificial intelligence, telematics, navigation and telematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for Samsung, the number one issue to tackle is safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing a &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/"target="new"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; study that finds road injuries are one of the top ten causes of death throughout the world, Samsung is putting its first round of money toward technologies that can improve Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), as well as automated driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung is investing about 75 million Euros ($89 million) in &lt;a href="https://www.tttech.com/news-events/press-corner/details/partnership-samsung/"target="new"&gt;TTTech&lt;/a&gt;, a company that is working on developing technology to improve the safety and performance of real-time systems, as well as software integration for ADAS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the new fund, Samsung has also made a number of investments in connected car startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its statement, Samsung noted that while it does have licenses to on-road test autonomous vehicles in California, as well as its home base of South Korea, it does not plan to build its own connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It is staggering to consider how much of our lives is now conducted through cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us haven't been to the bank in months since we can manage the entirety of our personal finances from the palm of our hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commutes are now dictated by what phones tell us, whether it be how traffic will affect our drive, what time our Uber will arrive or what's causing the subway to be delayed so long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, performing a task on a smartphone is the norm, and the analog version is a hassle. That seems to be part of the logic behind &lt;a href="https://www.bmw.com/en/index.html" target="new"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; board member Ian Robertson discussing the possibility of the company replacing car keys with a smartphone app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robertson made the comments at September's &lt;a href="http://www.motortrend.com/auto-shows/frankfurt/" target="new"&gt;Frankfurt Motor Show&lt;/a&gt;, alluding to the fact that physically putting keys in the ignition is already unnecessary in most new cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Honestly, how many people really need it?," Robertson asked &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-electric-truck/daimler-delivers-first-electric-trucks-the-game-has-started-idUSKCN1BP1OH" target="new"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Reuters at the show. "They never take it out of their pocket, so why do I need to carry it around?... We are looking at whether it is feasible, and whether we can do it. Whether we do it right now or at some point in the future, remains to be seen."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the rate at which this specific brand of automotive technology is progressing, though, the smart money would be on the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="http://continental-corporation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"target="new"&gt;Continental&lt;/a&gt; unveiled an "&lt;a href="https://www.continental-corporation.com/en/press/press-releases/2017-08-29-intelligent-door-93854" target="new"&gt;intelligent vehicle door&lt;/a&gt;" that would be accompanied by a digital unlocking system in place of keys. With Continental's new technology, users will be able to unlock their cars with their smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continental's system is more complex than merely using an app, and advances in cybersecurity technology in the coming years will likely allow for more streamlined ways of locking, unlocking and starting our cars. Undoubtedly, the convenience of a future car-opening app is appealing. But Robertson's vague description leaves a few obvious questions for the technology. Aside from the cybersecurity concerns, customers would want to know what backup systems would be in place for users whose phone batteries died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Robertson's talk about apps was just one part of BMW's activity in Frankfurt. The headliner was the unveiling of the electric iVisions Dynamics sports sedan, a vehicle that chairman &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/frankfurt-motor-show-bmw-i-vision-dynamic-details-pictures-2017-9/#the-i-vision-dynamics-is-the-concept-variant-of-a-production-car-that-will-fit-in-bmws-line-up-between-the-existing-1" target="new"&gt;Harald Krger said&lt;/a&gt; is "elevating BMW into a totally new dimension," according to Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, for those that want BMW and other automakers to push innovation as far as they can, Robertson's comments should be taken as a good sign. Even when the company's introducing perhaps its most futuristic car to date, it can't stop thinking about ways to progress even further.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It's easy to understand why some people are scared of flying on airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't understand the science behind flight, it can be difficult to wrap your head around how a contraption that weighs almost 200,000 pounds is able to stay in the air more than 30,000 feet off the ground. Even if you do understand the aeronautics, flying can still be a viscerally terrifying experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never mind the fact that commercial flight is orders of magnitudes safer than driving a car on a highway -- it's the mere concept of flight that activates people's worries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's easy to imagine a similar dynamic playing out with self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully developed, fully autonomous vehicles figure to be significantly safer than human-driven cars. But people's behaviors are driven by much more than logic. People will likely be nervous about adopting autonomous vehicle technology not when it is first introduced, but also after it has become "normalized."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation for this is the belief that a self-driving car could "betray" its passenger, swerving off the road to avoid a collision with a number of pedestrians. That's according to a new paper entitled "Psychological Roadblocks to the Adoption of Self-Driving Vehicles," a joint project between professors from MIT, the Toulouse School of Economics and UC-Irvine that was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/" target="new"&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles promises to make us happier, safer and more efficient," reads &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0202-6.epdf?author_access_token=hIPFve-_FyWqH9BmLOQ97tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NibPp4APIORzsUgk2YGwLwfFVnSvzZZly4zKdmiCNGN3vzROu9Rdq-3gC1ywxN6pAQxHsWzVpJZSkFC1gzqpZTTi-uyD8x3wzA0eguxlo6JA%3D%3D&amp;amp;utm_content=bufferdeecd&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="new"&gt;the paper's&lt;/a&gt; introduction. "But the biggest roadblocks standing in the path of mass adoption may be psychological, not technological; 78% of Americans report fearing riding in an autonomous vehicle, with only 19% indicating that they would trust the car."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper outlines three key "psychological challenges" that its authors believe will pose significant obstacles to the widespread adoption of driverless cars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The dilemmas of autonomous ethics"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Risk heuristics and algorithmic aversion"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Asymmetric information and the theory of the machine mind"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, "autonomous ethics," addresses the aforementioned possibility that a car may not act in the best interest of its passengers when it comes to safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to imagine vehicles acting from one sky-high ethical viewpoint, doing whatever is necessary to protect the greater good. In the abstract, it can be easy to think that a car with one person in it should supplant the interests of its passenger if it means protecting a larger group. But when you're that one passenger in the car, that isn't what you want the vehicle to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To overcome that fear, we need to make people feel both safe and virtuous about owning an autonomous vehicle," according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second section discusses how well-publicized crashes -- even when rare -- can incite fear in others about the technology in question. The authors say that OEMs and regulators need to be optimistic &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; realistic with consumers, while avoiding false promises that paint AVs as infallible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third section recommends transparency regarding the underlying technology of self-driving cars will help passengers appreciate the constant "successes" of the tech in addition to inevitably being aware of its rare failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study offers other unique viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the bubble of the autonomous vehicle sector, it's easy to get caught up in rhetoric that looks at the self-driving car future through rose-colored glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the real shortcomings of autonomous vehicles in honest terms is the best way to get people outside the bubble to recognize the true promise of the technology and make them advocates for it.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The Movimento website is adorned with awards that the company has won for its automotive over-the-air (OTA) update platform: The IoT Evolution Excellence Award (2015), the IoT Breakthrough Product of the Year (2016), the TMCnet Business Impact Award (2016), the TU-Automotive Best Telematics Award (2016) and the Frost &amp; Sullivan Enabling Technology Leadership Award (2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it's a product that has been well received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company leaders are able to add another trophy to the collection this month, as &lt;a href="https://movimentogroup.com/" target="new"&gt;Movimento&lt;/a&gt; recently received Frost &amp; Sullivan's 2017 Award for Excellence in Technology Innovation for its Unified OTA Platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Movimento platform is about much more than winning awards. It's about changing the way that the car of the future operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Software Defined Car is about proactively managing vehicle software, security and data. These key characteristics will define the success of tomorrow's automotive company," Movimento CTO and CMO &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/movimento-honored-with-frost--sullivans-award-for-2017-excellence-in-technology-innovation-300522468.html" target="new"&gt;Mahbubul Alam&lt;/a&gt; noted in an announcement. "Movimento's Unified OTA Platform is here to help the automotive industry and is ready for the future with advanced capabilities including artificial intelligence."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unified OTA Platform is a technology platform that allows vehicular systems to stay up to date with software without having to take a trip to a dealership. As automobiles become ever more reliant on computerized systems, that software will need to be updated regularly, much like the operating system on your phone or laptop. But taking a car in for service every time a new software update is released is unfeasible. That's why Movimento has developed an over-the-air platform, where updates can be sent to a vehicle remotely in an efficient and secure manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For OEMs, this technology can yield tremendous benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The new wireless technology matches modules with the correct software in-plant, on the line, and at the point of installation," the &lt;a href="https://movimentogroup.com/products/scalable-software-management/" target="new"&gt;company says&lt;/a&gt;. "This is a radical shift from the old model of sorting and serializing modules at the sorting hub, then taking up floor space storing numerous different modules in the plant."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movimento is also focused on delivering solutions that improve consumers' lives, such as protecting their vehicles and their personal information by using the latest cybersecurity technologies. As vehicle infotainment systems have evolved, the quantity and depth of consumer information stored in them has grown accordingly, opening up data like passwords and credit card info to a potential cyberattack. Even scarier is the possibility that a car could be hijacked and remotely driven by a hacker. Movimento's systems stay ahead of those who would do harm, preventing cyber break-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past January, Movimento joined with &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736022" target="new"&gt;another innovative leader&lt;/a&gt; in vehicle connectivity when it was acquired by auto tech supplier &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/" target="new"&gt;Delphi Automotive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The acquisition of Movimento strengthens Delphi's position as a leading end-to-end systems and software provider to the industry as vehicle connectivity becomes increasingly ubiquitous," said Delphi president and CEO Kevin Clark at the time of &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delphi-strengthens-end-end-secure-140000033.html" target="new"&gt;the deal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As connected cars come to represent a greater proportion of vehicles on the road with each passing year, it's important to remember that the safety and efficacy of these cars is not a given. Products like Movimento's OTA Platform are necessary to keep cars and passengers safe. Because at the end of the day, that's an accomplishment greater than any award.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As we approach December 17, over 3 million truck drivers are preparing to comply with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's electronic logging device (ELD) mandate. Under this mandate, commercial fleet companies must require their drivers to electronically log daily hours of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having worked with fleet companies for many years, I understand the hesitancy that comes with major change. But change is coming whether we like it or not. And forward-looking companies can seize the opportunity to become more efficient, transform business operations and strengthen customer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The ELD mandate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Truck drivers are already required to record their hours of service, including on-duty, off-duty, driving or resting time. Most enter their hours manually on paper, which often leads to inaccuracies and errors. These mistakes can result in non-compliance, hefty fines and safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/data-and-statistics/large-truck-and-bus-crash-facts"target="new"&gt;one in every 15 trucks&lt;/a&gt; is involved in a crash, which accounts for $100 billion in damages. In addition, 33% of all &lt;a href="https://www.iothub.com.au/news/ict-players-unite-to-tackle-connected-car-security-471048"target="new"&gt;roadside inspections&lt;/a&gt; in the US resulted in a logging violation in 2015 -- 34% of those due to a driver not having a required paper log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the &lt;a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/electronic-logging-devices"target="new"&gt;ELD mandate&lt;/a&gt; and electronic logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Connecting people, vehicles and assets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
The ELD mandate presents the opportunity to transform business operations. Consider a full-service fleet solution, for instance, that offers all-in-one fleet, asset and mobile-worker tracking and management with the Internet of Things (IoT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An integrated and adaptable solution offers drivers a mobile application and takes you beyond fleet-centric operations by delivering near real-time data to a central hub. You're able to fully connect your employees, fleets and assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost benefit, crew visibility, and increased efficiency a solution of this type offers is unprecedented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Employees&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.automotive-fleet.com/article/story/2015/10/how-to-increase-fleet-productivity.aspx"target="new"&gt;Market research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that telematics can increase workforce productivity and reduce labor costs by up to 12%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vehicles&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.driversalert.com/attention-fleet-manager-fleet-safety-is-important-too"target="new"&gt;Insurance companies&lt;/a&gt; have reported a 45% reduction in accident payout cost via the use of telematics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assets&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="http://m.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/3275/Towards_smarter_supply_chains.html"target="new"&gt;Telematics technology&lt;/a&gt; can help a company reduce maintenance and repair costs by as much as 14%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering a solution of this type, ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does this solution help my company holistically -- connecting my vehicles, assets and drivers/mobile workers on a single platform?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can this platform integrate additional products and services, increasing the value and reach of my business operations? For example, does it offer push to talk communications/mobile voice dispatch, mobile forms, and mobile device management and security?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would this solution connect my vehicles, assets and drivers to a network that offers a comprehensive ecosystem, simplifying purchasing and deployment, with strong distribution via direct sales and retail?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The future, and transforming your business&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
As we look at the automated vehicle future, fleet management must transform as well to adopt the latest technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the fleet industry evolves, choose solutions and partners that will evolve with it. Over time, fleet management providers have gone beyond what was once a basic understanding vehicle data. They're now collecting data from mobile assets, sensors and more to further inform decisions and improve operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With increased data comes an increased need for analytics, which leads to insights that transform business operations and strengthen customer relationships. These insights go beyond just fleets. They reach drivers, and they reach the assets that drivers transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look ahead, this data will start to address recommendations for alternative fuel vehicles, charging station locations, and even predictive maintenance. It's critical that forward-thinking fleet management companies stay ahead of these industry trends in order to help their customers make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Choose partners and solutions that take your fleet beyond the basics, and prepare your fleets to adapt to industry evolution. Look beyond existing requirements, and create the next generation of commercial fleets with IoT.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In April, Waymo CEO John Krafcik penned a Medium post encouraging residents of the Phoenix metro area to apply to join the company's early rider program. Waymo was expanding its fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica vans from 100 to 600, and it needed passengers so the company could learn how the vehicles would be best utilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Over the course of this trial, we'll be accepting hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds and transportation needs who want to ride in and give feedback about &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;'s self-driving cars," &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/apply-to-be-part-of-waymos-early-rider-program-5fd996c7a86f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Krafcik. "Rather than offering people one or two rides, the goal of this program is to give participants access to our fleet every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area that's about twice the size of San Francisco."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Waymo's early riders are about to be a part of automotive history, as the company announced that it has become the first company to test self-driving cars on public roads without a human in the driver's seat, and that the vehicles will be used to transport riders in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Over the next few months, we'll be inviting members of the public to take trips in our fully self-driving vehicles," the company &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/with-waymo-in-the-drivers-seat-fully-self-driving-vehicles-can-transform-the-way-we-get-around-75e9622e829a" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a new Medium post published on November 7. "Participants in our early rider program will be amongst the first to experience these fully self-driving rides, using our vehicles to commute to work, take the kids to school, or get home from a night out."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of Waymo's examples implicitly call to mind the ways in which a self-driving car can represent an upgrade over a human-driven one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a commute to work in a self-driving car, for example, a passenger can get work done or even just relax instead of starting their day by navigating a stressful traffic jam. An AV can also serve as a chauffeur for children, or other members of the population who are unable to drive themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And driverless cars also figure to significantly reduce instances of drunk driving, as inebriated passengers won't be able to cause damage if they're not behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the announcement, Waymo touts the relentless work the company has done since 2009, when it was founded as part of Google, to make safe, reliable self-driving cars a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has tested over 20,000 traffic scenarios on private courses, and driven more than 3.5 million autonomous miles on public roads in 20 American cities. The company also mentioned its &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735854" target="new"&gt;virtual platform&lt;/a&gt; for testing AV software, in which its systems drive over 10 million miles each day. How's that for a driver's ed program?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the hype around autonomous vehicles focuses on the belief that shared fleets will render personal car ownership largely a thing of the past, an idea that Waymo endorses in the Medium post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By giving people access to a fleet of vehicles, rather than starting with a personal ownership model, more people will be able to experience this technology, sooner," the company notes. "A fully self-driving fleet can offer new and improved forms of sharing: it'll be safer, more accessible, more flexible, and you can use your time and space in the vehicle doing what you want."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While other leaders in the self-driving space will likely catch up soon in this specific regard, Waymo's status as the first AV manufacturer to put driverless cars on the road without a human in the driver's seat will go a long way towards establishing trust among consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The idea of traveling around the world has held a special place in the public imagination since at least 1873 when Jules Verne published &lt;em&gt;Around the World in Eighty Days&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixteen years after the book's release, journalist Nellie Bly recreated the feat in Verne's tale in 72 days. Her resulting book became a best-seller in its own right. In the 1920's, Aloha Wanderwell's seven-year adventure around the globe by car earned her the nicknames "The World's Most Widely Traveled Girl" and "The Amelia Earhart of the Automobile."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, comedian Michael Palin filmed a television special for BBC in which he traveled around the world in 80 days -- without using any aircrafts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's probably for the best that artificial intelligence systems haven't yet developed to a point where they harbor their own travel dreams. But it shouldn't come as a surprise that human developers of autonomous vehicles want to test their projects on across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons extend beyond a healthy sense of adventure. Seeing how self-driving cars behave in different countries, landscapes and climates provides extremely valuable data that can be used on future endeavors. That is part of the reason behind &lt;a href="https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index?gclid=Cj0KCQiA84rQBRDCARIsAPO8RFz4BM_qxLuvStLE34SdJ6Cle7Yii56NlnrZpsUjLij8Rs51OLtagM0aApEXEALw_wcB" target="new"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;'s ambitious Intelligent World Drive, an initiative to test driverless prototypes of the S-Class on five continents in five months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Recording, processing and interpreting highly complex traffic situations is the key to safe automated and autonomous driving. This is particularly demanding in dense urban traffic. This is why we are deliberately testing our automated driving functions in everyday driving situations in large cities," Daimler AG board member Ola Kallenius wrote in a &lt;a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/on-the-road-to-autonomous-driving-mercedes-benz-on-automated-worldwide-test-drive" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "In this way not only do our vehicles become more intelligent, they also become safer."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mercedes &lt;a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/second-leg-of-the-intelligent-world-drive" target="new"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; detailing the Intelligent World Drive's stop in Shanghai described how different international traffic patterns can be from one another from the perspective of a self-driving car's operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, speed limits can differ from lane to lane and parking spots come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The density of traffic in Chinese cities is overwhelming for most human drivers who aren't from the region, and markings on Chinese road signs can bear striking similarities to American ones that have distinctly different meanings. Needless to say, it takes more than a software tweak or two to translate self-driving systems from one country to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's not a given that all countries will be as accepting to self-driving cars as countries like Germany, the United States, and England have been thus far. With this in mind, the Intelligent World Drive seems to be just as much of a diplomatic mission as it is an information-gathering one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Progress must not stop at national borders. Legislation must keep pace with technological development. Otherwise it will not be possible for important innovations in automated and autonomous driving to hit the road," noted Daimler board member Renata Jungo Brungger. "Legal certainty is essential for the acceptance of autonomous driving in society. So we quickly need further international harmonization of the legal framework."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its status as a global luxury brand, few automakers are better positioned as international ambassadors than Mercedes. If Mercedes is successful with its Intelligent World Drive, the implications for autonomous vehicle development in new regions could be enormous.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Even without autonomous vehicles figuring into the equation, the use of ride-hailing services has skyrocketed in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, people find it incredibly convenient and appealing to order a ride on demand from the palm of their hands. (Well, from a device in the palm of their hands. We haven't reached the point of skin-as-touchscreen -- yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, especially those in urban areas, ride-hailing has become a viable alternative to car ownership. The time and money saved by not worrying about parking, insurance or maintenance -- not to mention actually purchasing a vehicle -- can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have also shown that young people are less interested in owning cars -- or even just driving -- than previous generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, you still see a picture of a human driver while waiting for an Uber or Lyft to arrive. But self-driving fleets look set to play an increasingly large role in ride-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many predict this development will fundamentally shift how we get around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without human drivers involved, the availability of rides will increase and the waiting time and costs for rides will decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French company Navya took another step toward that future on November 7, when it introduced a fully autonomous robotaxi called Autonom Cab at a private event in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Imagine what cities would be like if there were nothing but Autonoms running on the road. No more traffic jams or parking problems, fewer accidents and less pollution, Navya CEO Christophe Sapet wrote in a &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MSmPZK534SK9IxWTFDLorekX1ZWztP_paHPG4dXJTyg/edit" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "At Navya, we recognize that the status of individual cars is rapidly changing, especially among younger generations, many of whom don't have their driver's license and are less attached to the concept of owning a car. What they want are mobility solutions available 24/7, ensuring their safety and well-being at a reduced cost. Autonom Cab is leading edge and will revolutionize both habits and technology, enabling a great many people to gain access to a brand-new mobility solution."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navya isn't the first company to introduce such a product --
Waymo, Cruise Automation and Uber have all announced similar initiatives in recent months that will remove human operators from the driver's seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navya's Autonom Cab, however, stands out in a major way: It doesn't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a driver's seat. In fact, there's no cockpit at all, with no steering wheel or pedals. Similar prototypes have eliminated these features before, but none have been this far along in development and close to hitting the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4ABVE2m1BQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Autonom Cab's predecessor, the Autonom Shuttle, is already being deployed. These fully electric, self-driving shuttle buses are carrying passengers in Las Vegas, Michigan and Singapore. Their introduction has not been without incident. An Autonom Shuttle was involved in a minor fender bender mere hours after Las Vegas officials celebrated its launch in the city. The shuttle, however, was not at fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that its sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped to avoid the accident," the City of Las Vegas noted in a &lt;a href="http://cityoflasvegas.tumblr.com/post/167279971383/update-minor-incident-downtown-wednesday" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Unfortunately the delivery truck did not stop and grazed the front fender of the shuttle. Had the truck had the same sensing equipment that the shuttle has the accident would have been avoided."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Autonom Cab will be able to hold up to six passengers. It will be equipped with three 360-degree Lidars, seven 145-degree lidars, six cameras and will be V2X enabled. The Autonom Cab is expected to make its US debut at the CES trade show in January and may begin testing in new cities in the second quarter of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas Strip has no shortage of sights to be seen and experiences to be had. But earlier this month, the city added something new: a self-driving shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 8, the city launched a year-long pilot program where locals and tourists could ride around the city's "innovation district" on an autonomous passenger shuttle designed by French AV company &lt;a href="http://navya.tech/en/" target="new"&gt;Navya&lt;/a&gt; and operated by global public transportation Keolis. Since it was Vegas, the launch of the shuttle even featured magicians Penn and Teller and NASCAR driver Danica Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is the next stage to see if autonomous vehicles have any conflicts with real-time traffic, which will help us determine if this technology can be rolled out on a longer term,"&lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/downtown/driverless-shuttle-bringing-a-glimpse-of-the-future-to-downtown-las-vegas/" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Las Vegas Chief Operations and Development Officer Jorge Cervantes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city soon got an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours after its launch, one of the Navya shuttles was involved in a fender bender with a human-driven truck. The city insisted that the human driver was at fault, not the autonomous shuttle, and the driver of the truck was issued a ticket by police. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that its sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped to avoid the accident," the city noted in a blog &lt;a href="http://cityoflasvegas.tumblr.com/post/167279971383/update-minor-incident-downtown-wednesday" target="new"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. "Unfortunately the delivery truck did not stop and grazed the front fender of the shuttle. Had the truck had the same sensing equipment that the shuttle has the accident would have been avoided."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalist Jeff Zurschmeide was on the bus at the time of the crash and wrote about the experience for &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/self-driving-bus-crash-vegas-account/" target="new"&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/a&gt;. According to Zurschmeide, the bus didn't do anything &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, but it didn't exactly handle the incident like a seasoned human driver, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We had about 20 feet of empty street behind us (I looked) and most human drivers would have thrown the car into reverse and used some of that space to get away from the truck," Zurschmeide wrote. "Or at least leaned on the horn and made our presence harder to miss. The shuttle didn't have those responses in its program."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US National Transportation Safety Board announced that it would &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/autos-selfdriving/u-s-safety-board-to-probe-self-driving-shuttle-crash-in-las-vegas-idUSL1N1NG15I" target="new"&gt;visit Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the incident. It's unclear what exactly the Board is looking for, but AAA of Southern Nevada expressed an eagerness to work with the investigators to learn more about the crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no one was excited to see the shuttle in an accident on its very first day on the road, it undoubtedly served as a learning experience for those designing autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Here's the key thing about autonomous cars: we humans will learn from this accident and we can add those features and make all future shuttle buses better," wrote Zurschmeide. "In a very short while, any self-driving shuttle will know what to do in this kind of situation."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing transportation experts and autonomous vehicle experts can agree on it's that no one really knows what the future of mobility looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many variables -- developing technology, legislative uncertainties and shifting social norms -- that still need to be determined before we know how vehicular autonomy will shape our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any proclamations about our self-driving future are educated theories at best, and shots in the dark at worst. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With book titles like &lt;em&gt;Car Guys vs. Bean Counters: The Battle for the Soul of American Business&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Icons and Idiots: Straight Talk in Leadership&lt;/em&gt;, former &lt;a href="https://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; Vice Chairman and Head of Product Development &lt;a href="http://www.boblutzsez.com/" target="new"&gt;Bob Lutz&lt;/a&gt; has plenty of opinions on the future of the driverless car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a new op-ed for &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20171105/INDUSTRY_REDESIGNED/171109944/industry-redesigned-bob-lutz" target="new"&gt;Automotive News&lt;/a&gt; titled "Kiss the Good Times Goodbye," he lays out a blistering take on what driverless vehicles will mean to culture in general and car culture in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are approaching the end of the line for the automobile because travel will be in standardized modules," Lutz writes. "The end state will be the fully autonomous module with no capability for the driver to exercise command. You will call for it, it will arrive at your location, you'll get in, input your destination and go to the freeway."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lutz believes these modular vehicles will be owned and operated by corporations with fleets of identical vehicles, while individual ownership of cars and the reflection of unique personalities they represent will fall by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lutz forsees a loss of identity for car enthusiasts as private ownership declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Lutz, the increased dominance of ride-hailing services is a precursor to the removal of human agency in a car's operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The vehicles will no longer be driven by humans because in 15 to 20 years -- at the latest -- human-driven vehicles will be legislated off the highways," he writes. "The tipping point will come when 20 to 30 percent of vehicles are fully autonomous. Countries will look at the accident statistics and figure out that human drivers are causing 99.9% of the accidents."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lutz acknowledges, most believe that autonomous vehicles will be significantly safer than human drivers once they mature. With that in mind, it's tempting to react defensively to his critique -- with all that AVs will do to save human lives, who cares what's lost along the way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But such a response ignores the alienation of those who love cars the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car culture has been a defining element of American life for a century now, and its deterioration would be a significant loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, such a development needn't take place at all. While the tech world indeed plays an integral role in the development of the self-driving car, the automotive industry is right there alongside it. And it is possible to shape an autonomous future that erases the worst things about our roads, while keeping the best. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The prospective benefits of having autonomous vehicles on our roads are many. Foremost among them is safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738177"target="new"&gt;oft-cited estimate&lt;/a&gt; is that driverless cars will eventually reduce on-road fatalities by 90%. The 24/7 availability of autonomous ride-hailing fleets will also make our lives more convenient, and perhaps less expensive as we transition away from individual ownership of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major benefit is accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underserved populations such as the blind and the elderly, who are often isolated due to their inability to drive, could dramatically improve their lives with greater mobility options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a prominent feature of autonomous vehicle legislation in the US. Both the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736110" target="new"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736893" target="new"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; have provisions in their driverless car bills that would establish councils to advocate for those with disabilities to receive access to self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain greater understanding of how self-driving cars can impact the elderly, there's no better place to test than in large-scale retirement communities. That is exactly what self-driving taxi company &lt;a href="https://voyage.auto/" target="new"&gt;Voyage&lt;/a&gt; has done in Florida, where it announced it will be bringing a ride-hailing fleet to service the 125,000-person retirement community of The Villages. With over 750 miles of road and three distinct downtowns, The Villages offers great variety to its residents. And with Voyage's fleet of robotaxis, they'll have easy, autonomous access to all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents of The Villages will first need to download the Voyage rider app, which features an interface not unlike that of Uber or Lyft. They can then order a Voyage self-driving car to come pick them up, and enter in their destination. After they've completed their trip -- perhaps shopping at one of The Villages' eight grocery stores, or catching a movie at one of its three theaters -- they can order another Voyage ride to take them home. It's like a standard ride-hailing service, except the car is driving itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Villages, Florida, is actually Voyage's second pilot community for this type of project. The first was another The Villages community in San Jose, Calif. In a New York Times article, one former board president at The Villages in San Jose described accidents caused by elderly drivers in the community that involved cars ending up in ponds and tennis courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The driverless car would be far less risky than the drivers that we currently have," he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/technology/driverless-cars-testing.html" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate HD maps for all 750 miles of roads within The Villages that can be read by the autonomous taxis, Voyage has partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.carmera.com/" target="new"&gt;Carmera&lt;/a&gt;. Carmera will not only render initial maps of the entire community, but also continuously update them via data accrued from sensors on the Voyage vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voyage also announced that it had completed a Series A round of fundraising, bringing its fundraising total in 2017 to over $20 million. That money will go directly toward investing in expanded services for The Villages.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Automotive giant Ford has filed a patent for a driverless police car that uses artifical intelligence (AI) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to nab law-breaking drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patent application was filed in December by &lt;a href="https://corporate.ford.com/innovation.html"target="new"&gt;Ford Global Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of Ford Motor Company, and is currently under review by the US government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wirelessly connected or "smart" traffic light, for example, would identify a vehicle that ran a red light and relay not only the license plate number and description of the vehicle, but also provide the driverless police car with the vehicle's location, allowing the Robocop car to follow the car and issue a ticket.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;In this instance, both vehicles are in communication with each other. For instance, if the violating vehicle is itself in self-driving mode that information will automatically be relayed to the police car, which will then respond indicating a disposition, such as a ticket or warning.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;If the vehicle is under driver control, the vehicle will send the self-driving police car a photo of the operator's driver's license.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the vehicle's description and location, the police car would also be able to access information about the owner, the car's history of violations and registration information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By automating routine police tasks, such as issuing tickets for speeding or failure to stop at a stop sign, police departments will be able to use human officers for tasks that can't be automated.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt; "While autonomous vehicles can and will be programmed to obey traffic laws, a human driver can override that programming to control and operate the vehicle at any time," according to the patent &lt;a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20180018869.pdf"target="new"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt;. "When a vehicle is under the control of a human driver there is a possibility of violation of traffic laws. Thus, there will still be a need to police traffic."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patent application noted the technology can be adapted to a variety of network computing environments involving in-dash vehicle computers, PCs, notebooks and mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dubai, child-sized self-driving police vehicles have already&lt;a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/emergencies/dubai-police-to-deploy-robotic-patrols-1.2049873"target="new"&gt; hit the streets&lt;/a&gt;, in this cased used as surveillance vehicles equipped with biometric software to scan for criminals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ford and the city of Dubai are working on self-driving cop cars, Waymo -- Alphabet's autonomous vehicle project -- is running tests to help make other self-driving cars respond quickly to emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Chandler police and fire departments in Arizona, Alphabet-owned Waymo has been conducting emergency vehicle testing with their self-driving minivans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo's self-driving vehicles are &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/recognizing-the-sights-and-sounds-of-emergency-vehicles-8161e90d137e"target="new"&gt; designed to interact&lt;/a&gt; with law enforcement and first responders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a suite of custom-built sensors, the vehicle's software can identify a nearby fire truck or police car, detect its flashing lights, and hear sirens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensors are designed to locate the direction sirens are likely coming from, improving the vehicle's ability to respond quickly and safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an emergency vehicle is detected, the vehicle can respond by yielding, pulling over to the side of the road, or coming to a complete stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p05300613/Autonomous-Trucks-and-Buses.html"target="new"&gt;Tractica report&lt;/a&gt;, which examines the market and technology issues surrounding autonomous trucks and buses, estimates unit shipments will increase from just 343 vehicles in 2017 to 188,000 units in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tractica cited more competition within the industry as a factor in providing significant opportunities to various industry participants, with the market reaching a value of $35 billion by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicle technology and infrastructure is to be among the biggest areas of opportunity for automotive suppliers, according to a new market analyst from analyst firm Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/manufacturing/articles/global-automotive-supplier-study.html"target="new"&gt;Deloitte report&lt;/a&gt; study found global automotive supplier revenue opportunities could exceed $700 billion over the next decade, with nearly a quarter (24%) of respondents saying electronics, infotainment and communication are among the key concerns for their company's or client's buying agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are based on answers from what Deloitte deemed global "Tier-One" automotive suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a quarter (26.7%) reported that they perceive electric vehicle technology and infrastructure as the area with the most opportunities in the next ten to 15 years, followed by 22.4% who believe autonomous vehicle technology and infrastructure to be the biggest area of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neal Ganguli, Deloitte's US automotive practice leader, told The Connected Car that the rise of autonomous vehicle technology has already affected the existing supplier space in numerous ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained it has disrupted the tradition linear automotive value chain as many non-traditional players, such as consumer technology companies, enter the automotive market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This has added fresh competition that doesn't necessarily follow the rules of the traditional automobile supply chain," Ganguli said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ganguli noted there are already partnerships between OEMs and consumer electronics and media companies, which span across several areas, including new technologies for in-car connectivity for entertainment and services consumption, vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity and autonomous and driver assistance enablers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These partnerships are likely to become more prevalent as traditional OEMs adopt more and more connected vehicle technology and embed mobile services such as phones, apps and media streaming into vehicles," Ganguli said. "Partnerships with more unexpected players, such as payments companies, will likely expand as consumers' expectations for their vehicles rise, bringing more segments into the mix."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to polling data connected to the study, approximately one-third of executives Deloitte questioned believe that flat volume and high disruption is the most likely scenario to occur in the space over the next ten to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the automotive industry at the cusp of a major transformation, the report highlighted key forces that could cause disruption in the near and long-term future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report warned volume headwinds could persist over the long term as a result of autonomous vehicle developments and car-sharing services that could dampen enthusiasm for self-ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ganguli said he believes there will be new growth opportunities for suppliers as new business models emerge in "come-to-you" mobile services, remote diagnostics, aftermarket parts and services and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"One scenario examined in our study paints a picture of highly connected, shared, and autonomous cars making a large dent in car volume, placing certain segments under significant pressure," he explained. "However, this scenario would also create new opportunities for automotive suppliers to grow in tandem with new technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study on automotive supplier performance follows a Deloitte global automotive consumer &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/industry/automotive/advanced-vehicle-technologies-autonomous-electric-vehicles.html"target="new"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It indicated that autonomous vehicle technology represents a huge opportunity to fundamentally change the competitive playing field, and revealed brand trust, cost and safety are all major factors determining consumer acceptance of autonomous vehicle technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half (54%) of US consumers in the 2017 study admitting they would be more likely to ride in an self-driving vehicle if it was offered by a brand they trust -- that number jumped to 63% in the 2018 study.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;To say that Intel's acquisition of Israeli sensor company Mobileye was a poorly kept secret would be something of a mischaracterization, as Intel announced its plans to buy Mobileye in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, though, news on collaboration between the two companies has been quiet. It turns out that they were just waiting to make the deal official. On August 8, Intel announced that it officially closed on the $15.3 Mobileye deal, a move that instantly makes the tech company a high-level competitor in the self-driving car space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With Mobileye, Intel emerges as a leader in creating the technology foundation that the automotive industry needs for an autonomous future," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-mobileye-acquisition/" target="new"&gt;said Brian Krzanich&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Intel, in a statement. "It's an exciting engineering challenge and a huge growth opportunity for Intel. Even more exciting is the potential for autonomous cars to transform industries, improve society and save millions of lives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the purchase was a foregone conclusion in the minds of most, the real news out of the announcement came from a separate piece of information. With Mobileye formally in the fold, Intel will now move to manufacture a fleet of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16119000/intel-mobileye-self-driving-cars-level-4" target="new"&gt;100 Level 4 autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Vehicle autonomy is rated on a scale of 1 through 5, with Level 4 autonomy representing a car that can deal with nearly all driving situations on its own, but requires a human driver for unusual instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicles will first be tested on public roads in Arizona before moving to trials in Jerusalem, where Mobileye is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If you can successfully drive autonomously in Jerusalem, you can drive almost anywhere in the world," Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/technology/intel-mobileye-driverless-cars.html?_r=0" target="new"&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. The international testing of autonomous vehicles by developers at both Intel and Mobileye will provide valuable insight as Intel establishes itself as a leader in self-driving tech around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even prior to this past spring's declaration that Intel intended to purchase Mobileye, the two companies had already been collaborating with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with BMW, the two businesses announced that they had &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bmw-mobileye-intel-idUSKCN0ZH4Z3" target="new"&gt;formed a triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; to develop a self-driving platform ready for mass production by 2021. This past May, that trio &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/bmw-intel-and-mobileye-bring-delphi-in-on-their-self-driving-platform/" target="new"&gt;welcomed a fourth partner&lt;/a&gt; in Delphi Automotive, which brought its own advanced AV tech to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that they're formally wed, the innovators at Intel and Mobileye will have full access to the deep resources possessed by their respective partners. With the ambitious 100-car initiative on the table from day one, expect plenty more news and projects to come of this not-so-new alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Leading in autonomous driving technology requires a combination of innovative proprietary software products and versatile open-system hardware platforms that enable customers and partners to customize solutions," said Shashua in a statement. "For the first time, the auto industry has a single partner with deep expertise and a cultural legacy in both areas."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When thinking about the different revenue streams that become possible with the widespread adoption of connected cars, the actual sale of the automobile itself, in some ways, becomes a secondary concern for many automakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slight uptick in vehicle sales can be expected as consumers become more drawn to the features of a connected car, but it's hard to imagine a huge, prolonged spike in vehicle sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real moneymaker for connected car manufacturers will be the data that these automobiles and their users generate.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vehicular diagnostics, infotainment system usage and other forms of analytics are incredibly valuable to third parties, and automakers are looking to cash in by monetizing user data. That, of course, brings up many security concerns on the part of drivers, who have been promised that their data will only be distributed to trusted parties, and that no sensitive personal information will be revealed about individual drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent developments at &lt;a href="http://volkswagen.com/en.html" target="new"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, though, suggest that another interested party could have initial access to a driver's data -- &lt;a href="http://www.am-online.com/news/car-manufacturer-news/2017/08/10/volkswagen-free-telematics-offer-to-link-dealers-with-customers-cars" target="new"&gt;the dealer who sold the car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news came as part of an announcement about the new &lt;a href="http://www.vwcarnetconnect.com/" target="new"&gt;VW Connect app&lt;/a&gt;, which leverages telematics technology from a dataplug product placed in VW cars to allow customers to link the operations of their car and their phone with one another. The dataplug, though, can also generate information that can be transmitted directly to the car owner's dealership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, this process will only take place if the customer opts in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dealers, the benefits of having access to consumer diagnostics are numerous. Understanding the driving habits of their customers -- how often they drive, where they drive, how fast they drive, how frequently they stop for gas -- would help dealerships better market their offerings and cater to their customers' needs. The most valuable information these dealerships could access would be certain diagnostics on a given vehicle's systems. If a dealer saw that they had a customer in need of an oil change or, a brake pad replacement, they could contact the car owner to set up an appointment for servicing. Dealerships could incentivize drivers to opt in to VWs service, or ones similar to it, by offering them discounts on repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen's optional system of offering data access to dealerships may present an interesting way forward in &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735049" target="new"&gt;an ongoing battle&lt;/a&gt; over over-the-air updates that is occurring between OEMs and dealerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side are auto manufacturers, which are becoming increasingly capable of offering critical security patches to their vehicles via OTA updates. On the other side are dealerships, which fear that they will lose revenue from repairs when drivers are able to have a large portion of their vehicle servicing done remotely. If more dealerships were given access to consumer data, such a concession might convince them to lessen their resistance towards letting OEMs deliver OTA updates. Of course, there is also another party in the debate who will hopefully get a say in the matter -- customers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Like any complex machine, there's no single part of an automobile that is &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several components are essential to its operation. An engine and wheels are certainly up there, but headlights and windshield wipers play an important role, too. But as we progress to a future in which autonomous vehicles become more commonplace, some auto parts that we now consider to be fundamental could go the way of the rumble seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the first conventional parts that engineers of a self-driving car might want to do away with are those that require the most human interaction: the steering wheel and pedals. Last February, &lt;a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; applied for a patent for a car design that features a removable steering wheel and pedals and, &lt;a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/176922/ford-autonomous-removable-equipment-patent/" target="new" rel="noopener"&gt;as first reported by Motor1&lt;/a&gt;, the patent was approved on August 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the proposed design, a lock-in system would secure the steering wheel and pedals into their normal places, and also allow for their removal. When the wheel and pedal were removed from the vehicle to allow extra room for a driver in a self-driving situation, trim pieces would cover up the receiving niches, giving the area around the driver's seat a natural, streamlined look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering how fundamental the wheel and pedals are to human driving, one supposes that the process of reconnecting these pieces to the vehicle would require several levels of physical reinforcement -- the consequences of a dislodged brake pedal are both easy and terrifying to imagine. With advanced hardware, though, it's theoretically possible that all a human driver would need to do to reinstall the wheel and pedals is simply press a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehicles that require no human intervention are deemed to possess Level 5 autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a car without a steering wheel would clearly need to achieve that designation. But according to many experts, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/toyotas-research-institute-head-says-full-autonomous-driving-is-not-even-close/" target="new" rel="noopener"&gt;Level 5 autonomy only exists theoretically&lt;/a&gt; at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, the presence of a steering wheel provides comfort to drivers in a number of ways. As autonomous vehicle technology enters the marketplace, few consumers will be comfortable diving in headfirst. For these reasons, Ford's proposed design is likely for a test vehicle. Currently, all self-driving test cars on public roads are required to have a human driver on-board in case of emergency. Ford's with-and-without steering wheel prototypes would be useful in both the current regulatory environment and in future, more permissive ones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than an extra foot or so of additional torso-level space, it's difficult to imagine many advantages of removing a steering wheel. But one possible improvement could come in the form of safety features. While automakers have optimized airbag placement around steering wheels for decades, removing steering wheels could ultimately allow for an even safer vehicle. It's just one area of innovation to keep an eye on as Ford and other automakers experiment with different AV designs.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When we hear the phrase "autonomous vehicles," the mind often goes to the most advanced version of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many people, a "self-driving car" is nothing short of an automobile with Level 5 autonomy, one that can navigate urban traffic and around accidents and find the perfect parking spot at a moment's notice. While no version of this car currently exists, plenty of vehicles that are already on our roads do have autonomous features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla's Autopilot, for example, is likely navigating a car on a highway near you right now in the US, and plenty of automobiles have self-parking features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the uses for autonomous vehicles extend far beyond the commercial and consumer realms. The Colorado Department of Transportation recently announced an autonomous vehicle whose primary purpose isn't to move people from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead its main job is to protect people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August, the Colorado DOT unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.codot.gov/news/2017-news/august/cdot-and-partners-drive-safety-with-world2019s-first-self-driving-work-zone-vehicle" target="new"&gt;the Autonomous Impact Protection Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (AIPV). As its name suggests, the AIPV is an autonomous vehicle with no passengers that is designed to intercept and absorb impact from oncoming vehicles that would otherwise strike workers in highway work zones. Traditionally, these vehicles have been piloted by human drivers. With an autonomous system accurate to within four inches, the self-driving vehicles figure to make roadways even safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three different companies had a hand in developing these AIPVs: &lt;a href="https://royaltruckandequipment.com/" target="new"&gt;Royal Truck &amp; Equipment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.kratosdefense.com/" target="new"&gt;Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.colas.co.uk/" target="new"&gt;Colas UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AIPVs work in tandem, with a "follower" vehicle trailing a "leader" vehicle that sends navigational, speed and directional data to their autonomous counterparts. According to Colorado Department of Transportation Executive Director Shailen Bhatt, the AIPVs will address a serious safety issue on the state's highways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Just in the last four years, there have been 26 incidents where a member of the traveling public struck a CDOT impact protection vehicle -- that's almost seven per year," Bhatt wrote in the announcement. "This is a dangerously high number when you consider that in some instances, a CDOT employee is sitting in the driver's seat of the vehicle that was hit. By using self-driving technology, we're able to take the driver out of harm's way while still effectively shielding roadside workers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danger around highway work zones is, obviously, not unique to Colorado, which had 21,898 car crashes take place between 2000 and 2014, resulting in 171 deaths. &lt;a href="http://www.govtech.com/fs/data/Colorado-DOT-Launches-Autonomous-Vehicles-to-Improve-Worker-Safety.html" target="new"&gt;According to the Federal Highway Administration&lt;/a&gt;, there was a crash every 5.4 minutes in work zones, plus 70 daily crash-related injuries and 12 weekly crash-related deaths in 2014. Removing a worker from the role of driving the most vulnerable impact truck will make these areas safer for drivers and workers alike. It likely won't be long before this technology spreads to highways in other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Everyone's very excited about connected and autonomous vehicle technologies," Bhatt noted. "My prediction is in the future, all state DOTs here in the country and even internationally will be using technology like this."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When thinking about the effects that autonomous vehicles will have on our roads, it can be easy to fall into an all-or-nothing mindset, where we believe that the benefits of driverless cars will only be realized once our roads are occupied exclusively by AVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many studies offer projections based on what will happen when human drivers are phased out entirely. A commonly cited &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/self-driving-cars-could-save-300000-lives-per-decade-in-america/407956/"target="new"&gt;statistic&lt;/a&gt; is that traffic fatalities will be reduced by 90% in a future when only self-driving cars are on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That caveat -- &lt;em&gt;when only self-driving cars are active&lt;/em&gt; -- is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get to that point, we have to make it through a hybrid period, with self-driving and human-driven cars operating side-by-side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study from Temple University provides some clues as to what that near future will look like. With funding from the National Science Foundation's Cyber-Physical Systems program, Associate Professor of Mathematics Benjamin Seibold and a team of researchers trekked to Tucson, Ariz., to test how just a small number of self-driving vehicles could affect traffic patterns when inserted into dense highway traffic. The results were quite encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our simulations indicated that it would be possible to eliminate phantom traffic jams if just one in every 20-25 vehicles were self-driving," &lt;a href="https://news.temple.edu/news/2017-08-08/tested-human-drivers-self-driving-car-calms-traffic" target="new"&gt;Seibold wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The instabilities that human drivers unintentionally introduce by their driving behavior can be canceled by a single well-controlled autonomous vehicle."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A phantom traffic jam is one we've all experienced but rarely quantified. It is initiated when a driver or a set of drivers start to brake for no discernible reason, causing a domino effect of slowing and congestion by the cars behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a common and frustrating experience to get to the end of highway traffic and have speeds pick up only to realize that there was no good reason for them to have slowed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a test track in Tucson -- Arizona is one of the nation's friendliest states for testing autonomous vehicles -- Seibold and his team set up two different scenarios: a circular flow of traffic featuring only human drivers, and the same traffic pattern, but with autonomous vehicles substituted in for a small number of human-driven cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference was stark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raising the number of autonomous vehicles in a given traffic flow from zero to 5% can reduce congestion by as much as 40%. And the benefits go even further, according to Seibold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What the few autonomous vehicles can do is mitigate the adverse effects of congestion," &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKo-v_qwJwo&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be" target="new"&gt;Seibold noted&lt;/a&gt;. "We take the same time to get to our goal but we do so safer, more comfortably and more fuel-efficiently. This has important economical, and also ecological, effects."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the test hold up to basic logic since advanced machines are more precise than humans, and less prone to random lapses of judgment or miscalculations. Of course, the research was conducted in a controlled environment. Understanding the impact of autonomous vehicles on real-world traffic is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The results of any such simulation must be taken with a grain of salt because of all of the unpredictable ways people actually drive in the real world," Seibold added. "Ultimately, only an experiment involving real human drivers can reveal whether the ideas work in practice."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, augmented reality technology seemed primed to have a major cultural moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyped up by tech blogs, Google Glass captured the public imagination before it was ever seen by consumers. People envisioned themselves walking around with computerized eyeglasses that projected ratings onto restaurants they passed and traffic reports onto roads they were driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a number of reasons, the reality of Google Glass failed to live up to the hype and was a large disappointment. Users could take photos and videos, but not a whole lot more. The whole thing officially sunk as aggressive users earned the nickname "Glassholes" and it became clear that augmented reality technology wasn't nearly far enough along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Google Glass 2.0 has quietly found success in recent months &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-glass-2-is-here/" target="new"&gt;as a tool for industry&lt;/a&gt;. It's not the only example of augmented reality technology breaking through. Last summer, Pokmon Go transcended the normal world of mobile gaming to achieve mass appeal, projecting images of animated creatures onto city streets through the screens of users' phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;It raised a significant question: Was AR back? Or, rather, was it arriving in earnest for the first time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is complicated. As CEO Vitaly Ponomarev of automobile navigation company &lt;a href="https://wayray.com/" target="new"&gt;WayRay&lt;/a&gt; described in a recent post for VentureBeat, the type of augmented reality represented by Pokmon Go or Google Glass is quite rudimentary compared to what is expected to be the technology's full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For true AR to hit mass market, the industry needs a rich app and content ecosystem and hero device(s) capable of handling it," &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/23/ar-will-drive-the-evolution-of-automated-cars/" target="new"&gt;Ponomarev wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "That hardware is nowhere near ready. Developers rely on the smartphone screen as the main (if not only) means to deliver AR. Wearables are not really an option either, as it's almost impossible to shove the high rendering performance, convenience, and good quality wide-angled picture into a small form factor."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication is that larger form factors will be better suited to housing a full-fledged AR system and, as Ponomarev goes on to describe, cars are a natural fit.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible functions of AR in a car windshield -- imagine graphics that let you look into the restaurants you're about to pass -- are almost limitless. Navigation systems will be far more intuitive and eliminate the need for users to take their eyes off the road in order to look down at a small phone or in-car nav screen. Traffic information will be provided in real time, giving drivers a clear picture of how to get to their destinations most efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Once autonomous vehicles are in play, the possibilities expand to things like infotainment. In fact, according to Ponomarev, AR may play a key role in transitioning consumers to life inside a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A passenger should at any time be aware of what is happening in the car: why it chooses the specific lane, which cars are around, how busy one or another road is, how the route is being calculated," writes Ponomarev. "Augmented reality is a natural way to visualize the decision processes in the car so the passenger feels safer and more comfortable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies, including WayRay, are already beginning to develop these technologies. So if you were impressed by Pokmon Go, just wait until you see what augmented reality can do in a car. The scope of AR is about to broaden significantly.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Not all states are created equal when it comes to self-driving cars. Certain states are more permissive, allowing autonomous vehicles to test on public roads, providing tax incentives, and investing in infrastructure improvements that better equip roads for driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why so much autonomous vehicle development is happening in California, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than making the effort to expand into new states, autonomous corporations are instead doubling down on their efforts in the states they already operate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer an autonomous vehicle company stays in one city or state, the better their relationship with local officials. The local population also grows more accustomed to seeing and riding in driverless cars, which can help establish societal norms for how self-driving cars should interact with people in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why GM-owned &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; has more than doubled the number of self-driving cars testing on roads in California from 30 to 100, the company confirmed in a statement to &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving-crashes/gm-more-than-doubles-self-driving-car-test-fleet-in-california-idUSKBN1C92VD" target="new"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Deutsche Bank analyst Rod Lache &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/02/gm-to-launch-self-driving-cars-uber-competitor-soon-deutsche-bank.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told investors&lt;/a&gt; in late September, General Motors is believed to be leading the race to bring a fully autonomous vehicle to market, perhaps by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For employees in the Bay Area, where the company is based, Cruise introduced an autonomous ride-sharing app called &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735421" target="new"&gt;Cruise Anywhere&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. By having its own employees test the beta, Cruise isn't just offering an employee perk -- it's receiving key feedback that can be addressed immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's another reason that the company wants to grow its fleet of driverless cars in San Francisco: The city's chaotic, complicated streets and traffic patterns help Cruise's autonomous systems learn faster than they would in more sedate environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Testing in the hardest places first means we'll get to scale faster than starting with the easier ones," CEO Kyle Vogt wrote in a recent &lt;a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/why-testing-self-driving-cars-in-sf-is-challenging-but-necessary-77dbe8345927" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt;. "This may seem counter-intuitive, but by testing in densely populated areas we expose our software to unusual situations at a much higher rate, which means we can improve our software at a much higher rate. Based on our experience, every minute of testing in San Francisco is about as valuable as an hour of testing in the suburbs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, six Cruise vehicles were involved in minor crashes in the state of California. But according to the company, each incident was unequivocally the fault of the other vehicle involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one instance, a drunken cyclist barreled head-on into the front bumper of a stationary Cruise car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While we look forward to the day when autonomous vehicles are commonplace, the streets we drive on today are not so simple, and we will continue to learn how humans drive and improve how we share the road together," GM told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Delivering the mail is a notoriously thankless job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you don't want to get out of bed on a rainy Monday, imagine facing the prospect of walking underneath it all day. In snowy areas of the country, mailpeople truly are the unsung heroes of our society. Trudging through unshoveled walkway after unshoveled walkway requires both physical and mental stamina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing communication norms have reduced the stature of the mailperson job, and changing social norms have made the regular human interaction that used to accompany the job less and less common. Plus, at least according to television, you have to deal with dogs chasing you all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficulty of their work, many mailpeople find their jobs to be quite rewarding. A new USPS report finds those in the business of delivering the mail may receive significant assistance in their work in the years to come from self-driving mail trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Although much of the AV conversation focuses on how personal mobility will change, logistics could be profoundly affected as well," reads the introduction of the &lt;a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2017/RARC-WP-18-001.pdf" target="new"&gt;Autonomous Vehicles for the Postal Service&lt;/a&gt; report issued in early October by the Office of the Inspector General. "UPS, FedEx, DHL, and some foreign posts are already researching and testing the technology. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has also taken steps toward a pilot of a semi-autonomous delivery vehicle. This paper seeks to supplement that effort by providing a brief primer on the status of the technology and describing potential use cases for AVs in the delivery and transportation of mail."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mailperson's job is to maximize efficiency by finding a parking spot that allows them to deliver within a certain radius, return to the truck, and then repeat the process in another area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an autonomous vehicle could facilitate some steps, and eliminate others entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could locate parking spots on its own, giving the mailperson more time to deliver mail. It could also follow the delivery person around, which would both erase time spent walking back and forth from the truck and reduce the weight of loads that the deliverer physically carried. Further, the core principle of a self-driving truck -- the fact that it drives itself -- would be helpful with the delivery person inside the car. The deliverer could save time by sorting mail while the vehicle drove to a new neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In addition to saving time gathering the mail, AVs would virtually eliminate the time that carriers need to transition from driving mode -- hands on the wheel, feet on the pedals, eyes on the road -- to delivery mode, and back," according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also touts the possible benefits that autonomous trucking could bring to the USPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driverless platoons of trucks carrying mail long distances on highways could save time, money and manpower. The possibility of, in certain circumstances, eliminating delivery people entirely in favor of on-demand AV mail delivery services is even floated, although it is something that would likely come about on a far longer timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to email and other forms of electronic communication, many have come to think of "snail mail" as a relic of the past. But one need only look at the proliferation of Amazon boxes delivered by the USPS to find proof of the continuing need for the postal service. By exploring the emerging technology of autonomous vehicles, the USPS is displaying a nimbleness that bodes well for its staying power as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Even though they are developing technology that almost everyone on the planet uses, the behemoth Silicon Valley firms tend to be less open when it comes to allowing those same people a look inside their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these companies depend on proprietary algorithms that, besides being over the heads of most lay people, could give an advantage to their competitors. But as these companies become more and more essential to customers and are viewed more as public utilities, an increased level of transparency becomes expected. On one level, we are seeing this play out with the calls for more accountability from Facebook, Google and Twitter over the roles they may have inadvertently played in Russian hacking related to the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where this is coming into focus is autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more than any other sector, AV companies need to be transparent in their operations if they hope to build consumer trust. Driverless cars have the potential to radically transform society, but they will only do so if there is buy-in from the public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why a new report from Waymo is so significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-October, the Alphabet-owned company released &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;a 43-page safety report&lt;/a&gt; entitled "On the Road to Fully Self-Driving." The report details the core principles that shape Waymo's safety policies, the technologies that deliver these ideals on the road, and the company's vision for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Self-driving vehicles hold the promise to improve road safety and offer new mobility options to millions of people," &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sdc-prod/v1/safety-report/waymo-safety-report-2017-10.pdf" target="new"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt; states. "Whether they're saving lives or helping people run errands, commute to work, or drop kids off at school, fully self-driving vehicles hold enormous potential to transform people's lives for the better."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company describes its technology in plain-spoken English instead of insider jargon and uses numerous images to render the ideas even more clearly. A diagram of the vehicle sensor suite on a Waymo car -- which includes a Lidar system, radar system, camera vision system and supplemental sensors -- describes each component in a way that gives a readers an easy-to-understand sense of what each piece does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) works day and night by beaming out millions of laser pulses per second -- in 360 degrees --and measuring how long it takes to reflect off a surface and return to the vehicle," reads the report's description of Lidar tech. "Waymo's system includes three types of Lidar developed in-house: a short-range Lidar that gives our vehicle an uninterrupted view directly around it, a high-resolution mid-range Lidar, and a powerful new generation long-range Lidar that can see almost three football fields away."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo also lays out its testing process, showing how it meets high safety standards before proceeding with on-road testing. The company tests its software and hardware through various forms of simulation testing, closed-course testing and real-world driving, each of which informs the other processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As we drive more road miles, we continue to further refine our driving and update our software," according to the report. "This continual feedback loop allows us to build confidence that our software reacts and responds appropriately in the operational design domain, enabling our vehicle to operate at SAE Level 4 safely."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comprehensive and clear look at Waymo's self-driving cars outlined in the report will go a long way toward earning public trust regarding the safety of Waymo's fleet. It would be wise for other autonomous vehicle companies to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In late July, Tesla released the first batch of its much-anticipated Model 3 sedan, the latest electric vehicle offering from the innovative automaker and the one most expected to lead to mainstream adoption of electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard version of the Model 3 retails for $35,000, representing a considerable price drop from Tesla's previous models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That price is supposed to make the Model 3 attractive to car buyers who might not have previously considered themselves in the market for an EV. But consumers quickly discovered that $35,000 does not buy a fully-loaded Tesla. As with other car manufacturers, Tesla offers a lot of options that drive up the final price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone wanting a color other than black or a longer-range battery or autopilot features has to pay significantly more than $35,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of next-gen vehicles, whether they be electric, autonomous, or both, is one of the biggest hurdles for an industry looking to get over a hump. And it's not a hurdle that's going away anytime soon. In an interview with Axios, Alex Russell, CEO of Lidar development company &lt;a href="https://www.luminartech.com/technology/index.html" target="new"&gt;Luminar&lt;/a&gt;, noted that autonomous vehicles will fetch some awfully high prices when they're initially introduced to the consumer market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most of the attention is on bringing down the price of Lidar to $1,000, or even $100, so that self-driving can be embraced by the mass market," according to the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/fully-autonomous-cars-will-cost-hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars-2464972542.html" target="new"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Current top-of-the-line Lidar -- those boxes you see on top of test cars tooling around big cities -- cost $75,000 to $85,000. When the technology is optimized, the price will initially be $300,000 to $400,000 -- the price that fleet owners will be willing to pay because of how profitable ride-hailing will be as a business," Russell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidar is the laser technology that most autonomous vehicles use to detect their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using millions of lasers, Lidar sensors give autonomous vehicle software a blueprint to construct a three-dimensional map of the car's immediate environment, which it then uses to maneuver itself through traffic. The most recognizable form that Lidar takes is in the coffee can-shaped device on top of self-driving cars designed by &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Russell appears to be the first to predict such a hefty price tag for consumer self-driving cars, he is far from the first to point out that the current state of Lidar technology needs to evolve considerably for autonomous vehicles to take the road. As of now, most experts consider the state of the tech to be insufficient to guide autonomous vehicles at highway speeds. Further, even the technology that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; currently available would be prohibitively expensive to equip entire fleets at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Low-speed applications may be more affordable more quickly than higher-speed ones," &lt;a href="https://www.oxbotica.ai/" target="new"&gt;Oxbotica&lt;/a&gt; CEO Graeme Smith told the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608348/low-quality-lidar-will-keep-self-driving-cars-in-the-slow-lane/" target="new"&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;. "If you want a laser that's operating over 250 meters, you need a finely calibrated laser. If you're working in a lower-speed environment and can get by with 15 meters' range, then you can afford [to use] a much lower-cost sensor."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At only 22, &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40406052/this-sensor-technology-ceo-wants-to-be-in-self-driving-cars-by-his-26th-birthday" target="_blank"&gt;Russell is not a typical automotive CEO&lt;/a&gt;. With $36 million in fundraising, Luminar has become a legit player and figures to be one of the companies, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; company, that pushes Lidar technology where it needs to go. That, not cost, is his greatest concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The biggest question is not cost, but who is going to get there first," he told Axios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that may be true, cost is certainly going to play an important role in helping self-driving cars reach a tipping point. And since most people don't have a quarter of a million bucks to drop on a new car, no matter how advanced its technology, the sector is going to have to find cheaper alternatives that don't compromise on quality or safety in order to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If you're not part of the Silicon Valley tech industry, you can be forgiven for being unfamiliar with the typical employee's daily commuting ritual. Shuttles owned by individual tech companies pick up employees throughout the greater San Francisco area, transporting them in comfortable buses equipped with WiFi so they can work on their way to, and from, the fabled tech campuses outside of the city center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by the &lt;a href="http://mtc.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2016%20Bay%20Area%20Shuttle%20Census.pdf"target="new"&gt;Bay Area Council and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission&lt;/a&gt; determined that 800 tech buses transported 34,000 passengers to work every day. They've been a commute-easing lifesaver for some, and also, at times, a source of controversy in a rapidly gentrifying city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buses are an extension of Silicon Valley's devotion to the idea of disruption. The innovation could be pushed even further as Silicon Valley's fascination with autonomous vehicles now extends to shuttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was recently revealed that Bauer's Intelligent Transportation, a San Francisco shuttle company with clients such as Cisco and Intuit, is one of 36 companies to &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing" target="new"&gt; receive a California permit to test self-driving vehicles&lt;/a&gt; on public streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list includes big name automakers such as Ford and Honda, self-driving car leaders Waymo and Uber, and large tech companies, including Nvidia and Baidu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with French company Navya, Bauer's appears to be one of only two companies on the list that works with shuttles. Unlike Navya, though, Bauer's has been entirely opaque about its intentions with autonomous vehicle technology. The &lt;a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Shuttle-bus-operator-Bauer-s-gets-self-driving-11656078.php" target="new"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company has not registered any test drivers or vehicles with the California DMV, both of which, in addition to the permit Bauer's already possesses, would be necessary to test a self-driving car or shuttle on public roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bauer's wouldn't comment for the Chronicle story, adding another layer of mystery to their plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are only so many possibilities of what Bauer's is developing, or, at least considering developing. It's hard to imagine another company with a client base that would be more enthralled by autonomous vehicle technology, and it's quite possible that Bauer's is in discussions to partner with one of those clients to try and get self-driving shuttles on the road. It's worth noting that many experts consider the navigation of urban environments to be a higher challenge for autonomous vehicles, and such driving represents a significant portion of a tech bus's operations. Bauer's also offers private car and limousine services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the implementation of self-driving shuttles is already happening elsewhere. Beginning this fall, the University of Michigan's engineering students, faculty and staff &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734742" target="new"&gt;will use an autonomous shuttle&lt;/a&gt; built by the aforementioned &lt;a href="http://navya.tech/" target="new"&gt;Navya&lt;/a&gt; on public roads in Ann Arbor. Another French startup, &lt;a href="http://easymile.com/" target="new"&gt;EasyMile&lt;/a&gt;, also&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734191" target="new"&gt; plans to operate a self-driving shuttle&lt;/a&gt; beginning in August in a California business park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curious thing about Bauer's is that, while all signs point to them not currently having any substantive self-driving technology, it is unlikely that they would be able obtain a permit to test autonomous vehicles on public roads without it. The most likely scenario would be a partnership with a tech company that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have this kind of technology. It will be interesting to monitor this mystery as new clues emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In December, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder signed into law a bill that allows the testing of self-driving cars on public roads in the state. In doing so, he propelled Michigan into the ranks of US states, including California and Nevada, which have greatly benefited from leading the way on autonomous vehicle innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm excited to sign this bill," &lt;a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2016/12/09/autonomous-car-law/95199544/" target="new"&gt;said Snyder&lt;/a&gt; at the time. "In my heart I view this as a portal opening for safety, for opportunity for more economic success. We should be proud we're leading the world, right here in Michigan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automakers and other companies in the self-driving car space are already taking advantage in exciting ways. In July, the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Ontario Ministry of Transportation co-piloted a self-driving car equipped with Magna and Continental technology &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170731/OEM01/170739910/continental-magna-flaunt-their-autonomous-stuff" target="new"&gt;across the border&lt;/a&gt; between the US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734742" target="new"&gt;Navya will operate two autonomous shuttles&lt;/a&gt; for members of the University of Michigan community in Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While access to public roads is invaluable for AV testers, they need private facilities, as well. After all, if all self-driving car technology were completely ready for the roads, it would already be omnipresent. Engineers need private testing facilities to fine-tune existing tech and pioneer the development of ambitious new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private AV testing facilities in Michigan got a boost recently when Toyota announced that it would be making a $5 million contribution to &lt;a href="http://www.acmwillowrun.org/" target="new"&gt;the American Center for Mobility&lt;/a&gt;, a self-driving vehicle research center currently being built in Ypsilanti Township.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As we move forward with the development of autonomous cars, we must remember that not all test miles are created equal," Toyota Research Institute CEO Gill Pratt wrote &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyota-to-collaborate-with-the-american-center-for-mobility-300496584.html" target="new"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The road to creating a car as safe, or safer, than a human driver will require billions of test miles including simulation, real-world driving on public roads, and closed-course testing where we can expose our systems to extreme circumstances and conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACM, which is a non-profit organization, is in the process of raising $110 million for the total costs of the facility. It has currently raised $91 million in funding from public and private sources, according to president and CEO John Maddox. Toyota was the first automaker to contribute, representing a significant vote of confidence for the new facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm excited about our collaboration with Toyota," Maddox wrote. "Today's announcement is another example of Toyota's forward-looking vision and ability to move quickly on developing this potentially beneficial connected and automated technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACM is part of the state of Michigan's &lt;a href="http://www.planetm.com/" target="new"&gt;Planet M&lt;/a&gt; initiative, a large-scale private-public partnership seeking to establish the state as a center of the growing connected car and autonomous vehicle industry. The participation of a heavy hitter like Toyota reads as a positive sign for Michigan's efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Toyota deserves our thanks and praise for this significant investment in the American Center for Mobility," US Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote in a statement. "This is not only an investment in ACM, but is another strong sign that Michigan continues to lead the way in the future of mobility and innovation."&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If you've had the pleasure of interacting with virtual reality technology, it was probably in the context of playing a video game. Perhaps you were surrounded by motion-sensing cameras, and with VR goggles strapped to your head and sensors in your hands, you saw your actual physical movements transposed onto the screen directly in front of your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibilities for VR games are immense. You can be a rock star jamming out in front of a crowd of thousands, a race car driver zooming towards the checkered flag, or a James Bond wannabe gunning down would-be assassins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential for virtual reality, though, extends far beyond gaming. Futuristic thinkers imagine detailed surgical instructions superimposed over a patient's body, for example, or a detailed 3D model of a building bringing an architect's design to life. The real impact of VR will be felt in how it changes the way people work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the hope, at least, for &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/us" target="new"&gt;HP Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, as the company &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/hps-new-nvidia-powered-backpack-vr-pc-is-designed-for-work-not-play/?ncid=rss" target="new"&gt;introduces its new HP Z VR Backpack&lt;/a&gt; to the market. With graphics powered by a &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/global/global.php" target="new"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;'s Quadro P5200 GPU, the wearable computer can run various high-end virtual reality headsets and their accompanying software. It offers something of a unique feature, in that users aren't limited to a confined space when using it; they're able to roam freely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Virtual reality is changing the way people learn, communicate and create," &lt;a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=2504894#.WYOMHyMrJhE" target="new"&gt; Xavier Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, vice president and general manager for HP's Z Workstations, wrote in statement. "Making the most of this technology requires a collaborative relationship between customers and partners. As a leader in technology, HP is uniting powerful commercial VR solutions, including new products like the HP Z VR Backpack, with customer needs to empower VR experiences our customers can use today to reinvent the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UfPTqPrz20k?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For designers and engineers in all fields, virtual reality technology represents an opportunity to streamline their processes. The possibility of being able to easily render three-dimensional models -- even ones that are literally intangible -- is vastly preferable to the costly, time-consuming methods currently used for early-stage prototyping. As you can imagine, this is an especially large issue, seeing as constructing car models is &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; costly and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, VR solutions specific to automobile design are being developed. London design firm &lt;a href="https://www.seymourpowell.com/" target="new"&gt;Seymourpowell&lt;/a&gt; has already debuted software that it touts as being faster and more intuitive than the non-VR software that designers currently used to build virtual car models. Richard Seale, the company's lead automotive designer, noted that a better software experience empowers engineers and designers to test out bold new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We think that the quicker and easier it is to do something, the more likely you are to do it," &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/13/autos/seymourpowell-virtual-reality-car-design/index.html" target="new"&gt;Seale told CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing new models of cars can be a tense process: Manufacturing prototypes is expensive, and a return on investment is never guaranteed. However, if virtual reality technology can enable engineers and designers to experiment with imaginative features without fear of having wasted their time on something that never goes to market, we could see innovation in the auto sector occurring at a greater rate than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;One of the more appealing aspects of connected cars, and soon self-driving cars, is the amount of data that these vehicles will collect. That data is not only valuable to the manufacturers of connected cars, but other companies as well, and it's a sector of this business that is only expected to grow more over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced vehicle diagnostics, GPS data and infotainment systems all generate user-behavior data that almost every company wants to get their hands on. By generating advanced models of consumer behavior, businesses can fine-tune their sales approaches to best appeal to consumers on a macro and micro level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While issues of privacy are a cause for concern for some customers, there is an upside to vehicle data collection for drivers: The knowledge derived from connected car data analysis will be used to improve the in-vehicle experience for passengers. Here are three ways in which marketers and drivers will interact in the emerging connected/autonomous car economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location, location, location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're driving and realize that you need to make a pitstop for food, it's likely that you eat some places you wouldn't dine otherwise. Because you're making something of a gametime decision, you may end up spending too much money or eating food you don't enjoy. Combined with location services, the spontaneous nature of on-the-road dining offers restaurants a compelling opportunity to attract new customers. For drivers within a certain radius, a restaurant could offer an appealing coupon or a bargain deal applicable to that exact time of day, displayed on those drivers' cars' navigation systems. Of course, such a possibility isn't limited to food vendors; providers of all sorts of goods and services could bring in new business this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all experienced the disconcerting sensation of browsing for products online and, immediately afterward, having advertisements for those same products follow you to every corner of the Internet. Web advertising often serves as an example of targeted ads gone wrong, obscuring the fact that targeted advertising is, in theory, a good thing for everyone. If you must hear or see commercials, why waste your time hearing about products or services that have nothing to do with you? Fortunately, the experience of hearing relevant ads through a streaming music service or, in the future, watching relevant ads on video streaming services in a self-driving car is as natural as the way we consume radio and television ads now, except better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At your convenience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When autonomous vehicles become a common part of everyday life, a vast number of hours will be cleared for commuters and other drivers-turned-passengers to do whatever they please -- within the confines of a car, of course. That means that many will turn &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734361" target="new"&gt;to entertainment systems and activities like online shopping&lt;/a&gt; to occupy their time in transit. It's an impending reality that marketers and vendors are already salivating over, as it will almost certainly lead to an uptick in sales numbers. And with the steady development of connected car security technologies like &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734879" target="new"&gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, consumers drivers can be confident that in-vehicle purchases will go through quickly and safely.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In the age of the connected car, it has suddenly become quite common for automakers to collaborate with other companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OEMs would introduce new features to their cars with each passing year, they more or less perfected their core technologies many years ago. The connected car, though, represents an entirely new set of core technologies, and no single company can claim to be excellent at designing all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, these businesses have developed a willingness to partner on specific projects. Two companies might collaborate to build an infotainment system, for example, or a type of autonomous vehicle technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But few -- if any -- of these partnerships have risen to the level of &lt;a href="http://corporatenews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+mazda+enter+business+capital+alliance.htm" target=new"&gt;the one recently announced by Toyota and Mazda&lt;/a&gt;. Each company now owns a piece of the other, with Toyota receiving a 5% share of Mazda and Mazda now owning 0.25% of Toyota. (Considering the size of each company, those allotments are considered to be of equal value.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota and Mazda will collaborate on a shared platform for electric vehicle development, design infotainment systems and work on connectivity features, specifically as they relate to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity. To many, though, the most interesting news out of the partnership is that the companies will build a vehicle production plant in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies plan to construct a $1.6-billion plant that would churn out 300,000 cars annually and create up to 4,000 jobs. Toyota will use the plant for the production of Corollas, and Mazda will build crossover models that will be new to the American market. The facility is expected to open in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the economic boost that such a facility would bring to its chosen site, representatives from various regions of the US are already lobbying to bring the plant -- and its jobs -- to their state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As Toyota embarks on its joint venture with Mazda, we stand ready to grow our existing partnership and strengthen Mississippi's standing as a global leader in automotive manufacturing," Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant &lt;a href="http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2017/08/mazda_and_toyota_could_look_so.html" target="new"&gt;told NOLA.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2017/08/what_chance_does_alabama_have.html" target="new"&gt;AL.com article&lt;/a&gt; weighed the state of Alabama's chances of getting the facility. And an &lt;a href="http://www.ajc.com/business/will-georgia-make-play-for-toyota-mazda-factory/nE8UsLiL4FiNzvOF6MZpWI/" target="new"&gt;Atlanta Journal-Constitution piece&lt;/a&gt; considered the prospects of those states along with others in the Southeast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the connected car industry, the aspect of the announcement that will draw the most attention is the V2V and V2I connectivity. V2V tech allows cars to "talk" with one another, warning one another of traffic hazards or ensuring that they maintain a safe distance from one another. V2I tech enables cars to communicate with a central grid that, in theory, could document every active vehicle on the road and make sure that traffic proceeds safely and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the infrastructure referred to by V2I does not yet exist, and V2V functionality won't be particularly effective until many cars are equipped with it. But, in a way, that's exactly what makes Toyota and Mazda's forthcoming projects in these areas worthy of excitement. Work from these companies (&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734931" target="new"&gt;and others&lt;/a&gt;) will likely inspire other automakers to throw their hats into the same ring.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As with any emerging business sector, the self-driving car space has inspired plenty of questions about which companies will be the industry leaders when the dust settles (somewhat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the industry is still young and almost every single company with even a tangential automotive connection finds itself competing in some form. This mass participation has fostered a sort of parlor game with participants obsessing over who will be the "winners" when it comes to producing autonomous vehicles and their various components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, this is cause for optimism. &lt;a href="http://nutonomy.com/" target="new"&gt;nuTonomy&lt;/a&gt; CEO Karl Iagnemma believes that multiple winners will emerge across different regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;"There's this whole notion of a race and a race usually implies one winner," Iagnemma &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734565" target="new"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt;. "I don't believe there will be a single winner in this space. It's such a huge market. It's a global opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others, though, see a market with a large number of competitors that will inevitably shrink as the industry matures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are at least 46 different companies building software to control autonomous vehicles, including automakers," Mike Ramsey, an analyst for Gartner &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-05/go-long-chicken-wings-the-hunt-for-driverless-car-winners-is-on" target="new"&gt;told Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. "There's no way to actually assess the capabilities of the companies. People are doing it by marketing, employment numbers and how many vehicles they have on the road -- which are not very good metrics."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ideas aren't necessarily inconsistent with one another. In fact, it's quite likely that both are accurate, and their synthesis yields a simple truism: Many companies will succeed in designing elements of the self-driving car of tomorrow, and many will not. Realizing this, automakers, software designers, parts suppliers and others have opted to collaborate with one another instead of trying to go it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further cementing this logic of collaboration is a climate in which regulators worldwide are seeking to make sure connected cars and autonomous vehicles are produced safely and resistant to hacking. Both &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735183" target="new"&gt;the US Senate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735301" target="new"&gt;the UK government&lt;/a&gt; are in the process of introducing guidelines and crafting policies that address these matters. As a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/08/08/business/08reuters-autos-autonomous-bmw.html?_r=0" target="new"&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Times points out, "Industry experts say such standardization could make it much harder to develop a product which stands out, calling into question the wisdom of high-stakes, go-it-alone strategies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These partnerships are incredibly diverse in terms of participants, scope and focus. A partnership &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734772" target="new"&gt;between Microsoft and Baidu&lt;/a&gt; brought together two of the world's largest tech companies, with Microsoft lending the capabilities of its public cloud platform Azure to Baidu's AV platform Apollo. Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734561" target="new"&gt;tapped robotics manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; and German compatriot Kuka to service the automakers' electric cars and self-driving prototypes. Vodafone &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734283" target="new"&gt;teamed with insurance company&lt;/a&gt; Wrttembergische Versicherung to offer a telematics app that will help young customers improve their driving and perhaps even lower their premiums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing about these partnerships worth noting is that most major players in the connected or self-driving car space have several of them, not just one. Through that lens, many companies are behaving similar to venture capital firms, where they understand that they will be both winners &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; losers, but hope that the gains from the wins outweigh the losses.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Owning an enormous fleet of vehicles is not a particularly desirable operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large car rental companies, while still viable, find themselves to be in a significantly less advantageous position than they were a decade ago thanks to -- among other factors -- the proliferation of ride-hailing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the automotive industry goes, the position occupied by tech companies is far more enviable at the moment. Companies like Uber and Lyft are called "asset light" because they don't actually own the vast majority of cars that are used to deliver their services, allowing them to maintain greater profit margins. The fact that cars are an asset that depreciate in value rapidly only adds to the ride-sharing companies reluctance to own them. Still, &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; needs to own these automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dilemma is the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-09-27/tech-companies-grab-driver-s-seat-for-robo-car-future" target="new"&gt;a column&lt;/a&gt; by Bloomberg writer Shira Ovide. Ovide's piece focuses on the newly established relationship between &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, in which each company seeks to mitigate its own prospective weaknesses for a self-driving car future by taking advantage of the strengths of its partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Lyft has a network of customers, growing demand for rides and strong knowledge of transportation flow within cities," Sherif Marakby, Ford VP of autonomous vehicles and electrification, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/how-ford-and-lyft-are-teaming-up-to-take-self-driving-cars-mainstream-9bf2974a912a" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the collaboration. "We have experience with autonomous vehicle technology development and large scale manufacturing. Both companies have fleet management and big data experience. With our combined capabilities, we believe we can effectively share information to help make the best decisions for the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all well and good, except for the fact that Lyft doesn't exactly have significant fleet management experience -- it would be more accurate to say that the company has &lt;em&gt;driver&lt;/em&gt; management experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a distinction that Ovide seizes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In the current transportation reality -- including on-demand options such as Lyft -- the burden of owning and maintaining cars falls to the drivers," she writes. "But in the planning stages of transportation without human drivers, there is a game of hot potato in which the tech companies are trying to avoid the responsibility and profit margin-busting potential of owning fleets of cars that will still need to have their tires rotated and oil changed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as Ovide explains, OEMs aren't the only fleet owners interested in partnering with tech firms developing AV technology--rental car companies are, too, and for them it may be an imperative for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"[Technology companies] know that owning fleets of rapidly depreciating vehicles is not the 'asset light' business model that tech investors love," writes Ovide. "Google and Uber do not want to be Hertz. For one thing, Hertz's negative 1.6 percent net income margin the last 12 months is not a good look compared with Waymo parent company Alphabet Inc.'s 22 percent net income margin."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They may not want to be Hertz, but they certainly could benefit from accessing the resources of a fleet manager of that size. And now Google -- or Waymo, rather -- does, as the company struck a deal in June for Avis to help with the management of its Chrysler Pacifica minivans in Phoenix. Hertz has a partner, as well, in Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/technology/apple-self-driving-car.html?mcubz=1" target="new"&gt;scaling back&lt;/a&gt; its autonomous vehicle project, the Cupertino tech giant is still working on an artificial intelligence platform of some kind, and is &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/26/hertz-shares-soar-after-report-apple-working-to-manage-small-autonomous-fleet.html" target="new"&gt;working with Hertz&lt;/a&gt; to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With members of the public using our growing fleet of self-driving cars, our vehicles need standard maintenance and cleaning so they're ready for our riders at any time of the day or night," said Waymo CEO John Krafcik, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734174" target="new"&gt;explaining&lt;/a&gt; his company's rationale for working with Avis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tech companies, there is a constant focus on iteration, and the hardware costs of moving from version 1.0 to version 2.0 are minimal. But that is certainly not the case with self-driving cars. So even if the tech companies don't end up owning the fleets, they will likely have to spend a lot more money than they're accustomed to finding someone who will.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For someone whose company develops and sells Lidar sensor systems, Luminar CEO Austin Russell isn't scared of criticizing the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Current top-of-the-line Lidar -- those boxes you see on top of test cars tooling around big cities -- cost $75,000 to $85,000," Russell was quoted as saying &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735040" target="new"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. "When the technology is optimized, the price will initially be $300,000 to $400,000 -- the price that fleet owners will be willing to pay because of how profitable ride-hailing will be as a business."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That prediction isn't exactly music to anyone's ears, at least not anyone who's interested in owning a self-driving car anytime soon. Russell wasn't just saying that Lidar -- the laser-pulse technology that forms the backbone of most self-driving cars' operations -- is prohibitively expensive, he's saying that it's not yet viable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it will be even more costly once it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the 22-year-old Russell and &lt;a href="https://www.luminartech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Luminar&lt;/a&gt;, the company he founded after dropping out of Stanford, continue to try and perfect Lidar and make it affordable at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems they are closing in on both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota recently announced that a Luminar-designed Lidar is a central component of the automaker's highly touted new Platform 2.1 autonomous research vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This new Lidar provides a longer sensing range, a much denser point cloud to better detect positions of three-dimensional objects, and a field of view that is the first to be dynamically configurable, which means that measurement points can be concentrated where sensing is needed most," according to &lt;a href="http://pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+research+institute+demonstrates+progress+advanced+technology+research.htm" target="new"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from Toyota Research Institute. "The new Lidar is married to the existing sensing system for 360-degree coverage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lidar that Luminar has developed represents a significant step forward from the technology that is available elsewhere on the market, according to Russell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's easy to get an autonomous vehicle to work 99% of the time. The challenge is always that last 1% of the edge cases that it has to handle, like a kid running into the street chasing after a ball or a tire on the road," Russell &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/09/27/toyota-self-driving-car-luminar/" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a video for Fortune. "Autonomous cars cannot reliably see these things today. We allow autonomous vehicles, for the first time, to clearly make out and understand these situations, and make great decisions accordingly."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A lot of people talk as if the autonomous vehicle space is right around the corner, but that couldn't be further from the truth," he added. "In current autonomous driving systems ... the driver has to take over on a surprisingly often basis. We're the first center that actually meets the minimum specification of all these different car companies and tech companies have [needed] to enable fully autonomous vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell is far from the first to criticize the status quo when it comes to available Lidar technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's perhaps the foremost &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;point of contention&lt;/a&gt; on the technology side of the autonomous vehicle world right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small number of autonomous vehicle developers, the most prominent being Tesla, forego using Lidar altogether for a variety of reasons. But if what Russell says his true, his already well-regarded team at Luminar has broken down the barriers that have stalled Lidar's development for so long. That is all the more reason to be excited about Toyota's Platform 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For those who need a personal assistant, but can't afford to pay a human being to do the job, Amazon's Alexa has been serving as a dutiful stand-in since it first hit the market in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to know the weather before your commute? Ask Alexa to read you the forecast. Hangry, and in desperate need of take-out pasta? Ask Alexa to order from your favorite Italian place. Need some tunes to pumped you up while you wait for your pasta to arrive? Ask Alexa to cue up a Spotify playlist. With a seemingly endless array of functions, Amazon's voice recognition artificial intelligence product has become an increasingly frequent sight in households.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential applications for Alexa's AI technology extend far beyond the home and the Echo speaker that is most commonly found there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One natural place for Alexa to live is inside of a car, and &lt;a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html" target="new"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; has transformed that potential into reality with the announcement that the Alexa voice assistant will be integrated into all new BMW and MINI vehicles beginning in summer 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By making this step of integrating Alexa into our models from mid-2018, BMW and MINI will form a more intrinsic part of our customers' digital lifestyles," BMW Senior Vice President Dieter May wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0274792EN/digital-lifestyle-at-the-bmw-group:-seamless-in-car-integration-of-amazon-alexa-in-bmw-and-mini" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Voice control first featured in BMW Group cars many years ago, and we are now enhancing its functionality by adding a digital ecosystem, which will open up all sorts of new possibilities that customers can access quickly, easily and safely from their car."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As May points out, this isn't the first time BMWs will feature voice control technology -- in fact, it's not even the first time Alexa will be featured in a Bimmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the company &lt;a href="http://newatlas.com/bmw-connected-amazon-alexa/45449/" target="new"&gt;introduced compatibility&lt;/a&gt; for the personal assistant into its BMW Connected app. Playing music, performing search engine queries and reading weather forecasts were all included in the product's functionality, while third-party integration allowed companies like Domino's and Uber to provide services through in-car Alexa as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's unclear which specific additional services will be included in the forthcoming platform that were not part of the BMW Connected integration, but BMW says that "tens of thousands of Alexa skills that can be accessed from Echo devices will now be available for in-car use, too."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to work with BMW to bring the Alexa experience to their drivers," Alexa Automotive Vice President Ned Curic noted in the statement. "Using your voice to enjoy content and interact with Alexa makes a great driving experience even better. We can't wait for BMW customers to try this out."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To those familiar with connected car services, a voice recognition AI assistant is not groundbreaking news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is important, however, is the power of brand recognition that comes with the Alexa name. For the average consumer, "voice recognition" can sound a bit vague and off-putting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Alexa," on the other hand, signifies a set of services that they are likely to have some experience with. And when it comes to convincing a consumer to try a new in-car product, that can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For even the most attentive of drivers, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) can be helpful, even life-saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a driver is coming up on another vehicle, pedestrian or cyclist at high speed, an ADAS can prevent a collision by warning the driver with enough time to correct his course. More subtle features, such as lane departure warnings, can have broader-reaching effects than one might think. They can cause a driver to reflect on whether he or she is too tired to even be driving in the first place, indirectly preventing accidents that might have taken place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For bus or truck drivers, whose tasks are far more difficult than piloting an average passenger car, an ADAS can be especially useful in facilitating a safe and smooth journey. The limited visibility and wider turns that come with driving a large vehicle often leave a human little margin for error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help fleets provide their drivers with the necessary tools to drive effectively, &lt;a href="http://www.mobileye.com/en-us/" target="new"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt; has introduced Shield+, a retrofit ADAS that uses a suite of sensors to give drivers an advanced understanding of their surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People are recording accidents instead of preventing them, my question is why?" Mobileye European director Gil Ayalon told &lt;a href="http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/fleet-industry-news/2017/09/29/mobileye-shield-trial-proves-retrofit-adas-can-stop-collisions" target="new"&gt;FleetNews&lt;/a&gt;. "What we are seeing in fleet is direct vision, telematics, cameras, it's all about dealing with an accident after it happens or having to get the driver to look away from the road."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobileye's solution to this issue goes far beyond what is in consumer vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to lane departure warnings, collision warnings and speed limit indicators, headway monitoring lets drivers know their exact following distance from the vehicle in front of them, and alerts them if they become dangerously close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intelligent high-beam control system automatically turns a vehicle's brights on or off depending on light level and the distance from oncoming traffic. And a low visibility indicator lets drivers know when the system capabilities may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fleets, the ability to retrofit trucks, buses or other large vehicles with Shield+ offers a significant cost savings from buying new automobiles with ADAS natively installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also allows fleet operators to protect drivers and vehicles immediately. As Ayalon points out, even if all new manufactured vehicles came fitted with ADAS starting today, it would take up to 15 years for the majority of cars on the road to be ADAS equipped. By purchasing Shield+, fleet managers can rapidly accelerate that timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be consensus that -- as self-driving cars are bolstered by improving technology in the coming years -- ride-sharing and ride-hailing services will reach new heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability for autonomous vehicles to operate around the clock without a driver would allow them to serve a more diverse set of customer needs. And the ability to have a ride on-demand without buying, maintaining, or storing one's own car could represent a significant cost savings for the average consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, having a ride whenever you want it without owning a car doesn't require an autonomous vehicle. The success of Uber and Lyft has shown just how interested consumers are in ride-hailing services even in their current iteration, and the explosion in the fleet management sector shows that similar services are close behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past January, &lt;a href="http://www.cadillac.com/" target="new"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt; announced the debut of Book by Cadillac, an innovative luxury vehicle subscription service, in the New York City metro area. For a flat monthly fee, subscribers could use an app to select from an array of Cadillac models and have the vehicle delivered to their exact location, with Cadillac taking care of details like insurance and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Book by Cadillac is an innovative new option targeted at a growing class of luxury drivers searching for access to various cars over time, dependent on their individual needs, coupled with a hassle-free white-glove exchange," Cadillac CMO Uwe Ellinghaus noted &lt;a href="http://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2017/jan/0105-cadillac-book.html" target="new"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automaker has see a positive response since the NYC since launch, noting "overwhelming demand for enrollment." To build off of that success, Cadillac announced it would expand the Book service to Los Angeles and Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've seen widespread enthusiasm and demand from consumers who are seeking ways to complement traditional methods of buying or leasing a vehicle," Book by Cadillac Global Director Melody Lee said in a &lt;a href="http://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2017/nov/1113-book.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Book by Cadillac has introduced entirely new customers to the brand and has been fully embraced by younger audiences as an innovative service that meets their ever-changing needs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After paying a one-time initiation fee of $500, Book members pay a flat monthly fee of $1,800 for access to 2017 and 2018 model-year Cadillacs, including the XT5, CT6, CT6 PLUG-IN, Escalade, ATS-V and CTS-V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each account is limited to 2,000 miles per month of driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While designed primarily for a traditional human driving experience, Book by Cadillac does offer customers a chance to experience autonomous driving. Certain vehicles offered through the service are equipped with &lt;a href="http://www.cadillac.com/world-of-cadillac/innovation/super-cruise.html" target="new"&gt;Super Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, Cadillac's hands-free highway driving system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early success and expansion of the Book by Cadillac service shows that there are many niches to be explored when it comes to mobility and fleet management. While Cadillac's first-of-its-kind service caters to the luxury market, there may be similar opportunities for other companies to address the needs of different consumer sectors.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars have the ability to impact more than the way people get around. They also have the potential to affect how people work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rate that the autonomous vehicle sector is growing, it is set to become an increasingly large employer. But building a driverless car requires a very specific set of skills, which is why companies are constantly on the lookout for talented new engineers, who bring industry-specific experience and knowledge to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the age-old conundrum still applies: It's tough to get a job without experience and it's tough to get experience without a job. This is particularly true in the rarefied world of autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="new"&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt; is trying to close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online education service founded by Sebastian Thrun, one of the original members of Google's self-driving car initiative, offers "nanodegrees" in up-to-the-minute fields such as digital marketing, deep learning and, most famously, self-driving cars. Udacity provides instruction to individuals and corporate partners alike, and in November &lt;a href="https://www.infosys.com/" target="new"&gt;Infosys&lt;/a&gt; president and deputy COO Ravi Kumar S. announced that his company had joined with Udacity to offer an autonomous driving nanodegree program to its employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To accelerate this knowledge transfer and address the future needs of organizations everywhere, Infosys is partnering with Udacity on its self-driving nanodegree program called CarND," Kumar S. wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.infosys.com/insights/digital-future/Pages/driving-into-the-future.aspx" target="new"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; unveiling the partnership. "First, it will accelerate the pace of autonomous skill adoption, enabling Infosys employees to more quickly deploy autonomous technologies across industries like automotive, manufacturing, and mining. Second, it advances our commitment to lifelong learning of our global network of engineers, giving our teams the opportunity to work with emerging, world-changing technologies that will shape our future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program will be offered to Infosys engineers located all around the world. It will include one term of online studies followed by two in-person terms at an Infosys training facility in Mysore, India. The face-to-face AV training will have implications that go beyond company bonding, according to David Silver, head of self-driving cars at Udacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For many years autonomous vehicle development has happened in just a few places: Detroit, Pittsburgh, southern Germany," Silver wrote in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/udacity/training-self-driving-car-engineers-in-india-deb55b3e66cb" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt;. "Recently, we've seen autonomous vehicle development expand to Silicon Valley, Japan, Israel, various parts of Europe, Singapore, and beyond. Training autonomous vehicle engineers in India expands the opportunities for students worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That philosophy of inclusion is fundamental for Udacity. In September, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736597" target="new"&gt;partnership with Lyft&lt;/a&gt; to offer scholarships for its AV education programs to specific groups that traditionally had been left out of the tech workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Technology is not as diverse as we would like, especially around underserved communities, whether it's by gender, like women, or if it's by race, for example African-Americans and Hispanic Latino communities, and Native Americans -- all those are below the percentage of the population in terms of representation," Lyft chief strategy officer Raj Kapoor &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/udacity-adds-a-new-intro-to-self-driving-cars-nanodegree/" target="new"&gt;told TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "And so we felt like, is there a way to get some of those people attracted into this, why don't we give away 400 scholarships over the next year targeted to those people."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, by helping its employees expand their knowledge and training, Infosys runs the risk of losing some of them to competitors. But, historically, offering these types of services to workers has engendered great loyalty to the companies that offer them. Ultimately, it's a forward-thinking -- and relatively inexpensive -- way for Infosys to upgrade one of the most important segments of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;While the exact composition differs from one manufacturer to another, almost every autonomous vehicle design that has reached the working prototype stage features some kind of sensor suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bedrock for most is Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging. These sensors send out millions of laser pulses every second to their immediate surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By measuring how long each pulse takes to return to the device, Lidar sensors can ascertain the relative distances of surrounding objects, including other moving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key component of these suites is usually a set of camera sensors, which connect to image recognition software to help an autonomous vehicle react to road signs, traffic signals and other elements of the road that a pure sensor like Lidar cannot "read." In conjunction with other sensors, such as radar, all of these devices work together to give driverless cars a holistic understanding of their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every AV uses Lidar.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tesla is the most famous example, opting for only cameras and radar for its Autopilot functionality. And we also haven't seen a self-driving car that relies &lt;em&gt;entirely &lt;/em&gt;on Lidar.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that idea is exactly what's explored in a new research paper by &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; computer scientists Yin Zhou and Oncel Tuzel, which was published in the online journal arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the paper, "VoxelNet: End-to-End Learning for Point Cloud Based 3D Object Detection," Zhou and Tuzel detail a Lidar-based model for autonomous vehicle sensing called VoxelNet, and claim it performed better in simulated trials than traditional hybrid forms of Lidar sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference was not in the Lidar hardware used, but rather the software used to interpret the data received from the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In this paper, we remove the bottleneck of manual feature engineering and propose VoxelNet, a novel end-to-end trainable deep architecture for point cloud based 3D detection," write Zhou and Tuzel in the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06396.pdf" target="new"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;. "Our experiments on the KITTI car detection task show that VoxelNet outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. On more challenging tasks, such as 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, VoxelNet also demonstrates encouraging results showing that it provides a better 3D representation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735700" target="new"&gt;In August&lt;/a&gt;, a New York Times report indicated that Apple had scaled back the ambitions of Project Titan, the code name for the company's self-driving car project. A series of disputes and higher-up decisions led Apple to switch gears from designing a fully autonomous vehicle to focusing on other elements of driverless cars, essentially opting for a software approach instead of a hardware one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to Apple's secretive nature, it's unknown whether Zou and Tuzel were involved in Project Titan, but it seems a reasonable inference. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos/apple-scientists-disclose-self-driving-car-research-idUSKBN1DM08H" target="new"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, Apple declined to comment on the paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of official word from Apple leaves plenty of room for speculation. The publication of the research could be a trial balloon by the company to let those in the scientific and engineering communities know that Apple's autonomous vehicle work isn't done for good. There is even the possibility, albeit unlikely, that Zhou and Tuzel went rogue by publishing their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the reasons behind the research paper's publication, the potential of VoxelNet to alter the way developers look at Lidar remains enormous, and show that it's too early to count out Apple as the AV future unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In November, Waymo made an announcement that had been years in the making: The company was set to begin testing autonomous vehicles on public roads without drivers, making it the first entity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"After more than eight years of development, we're taking the next step toward unlocking the potential of fully self-driving technology," the &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; team wrote in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/with-waymo-in-the-drivers-seat-fully-self-driving-vehicles-can-transform-the-way-we-get-around-75e9622e829a" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; published on November 7. "Starting now, Waymo's fully self-driving vehicles -- our safest, most advanced vehicles on the road today -- are test-driving on public roads, without anyone in the driver's seat. To date, Waymo vehicles have been operating on public roads with a test driver at the wheel. Now, in an area of the Phoenix metro region, a subset of our fleet will operate in fully autonomous mode, with Waymo as the sole driver."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the month, Waymo achieved another milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter achievement precipitated the former and showed just how far Waymo has come since it began as "the Google self-driving project": Waymo's self-driving fleet had collectively reached 4 million miles of driving on open public roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to developing self-driving cars, experience is key to making the technology safe and ready for the road," the company &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/waymos-fleet-reaches-4-million-self-driven-miles-b28f32de495a" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on Medium on November 27. "Now, Waymo's fleet of vehicles has officially reached more than 4 million self-driving miles on public roads (for comparison, that would take the average American driver nearly 300 years to complete)."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability for Waymo to rapidly accelerate a process that would take humans much, much longer is a big reason why the company is now able to test its vehicles without a human operator. The vast amount of research that Waymo has conducted has also helped it convince regulators that it is safe for the driverless cars to be carrying passengers around without the human safety net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has ramped up its own research process since Mile 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took Waymo only six months to get from 3 million miles to 4 million. By contrast, Waymo spent a year and a half accumulating its first million self-driving miles. The testing has taken place in in 23 cities across Texas, Arizona, California and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of real-world testing pales in comparison to the amount of virtual testing Waymo's AVs are subjected to. The company says it has driven 2.5 billion simulated miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Every day in simulation, more than 25,000 virtual self-driving cars practice hard cases we've already encountered on the road, or re-drive all the miles we've ever driven so we can dramatically accelerate our pace of learning," Waymo writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, with passengers onboard its AVs, Waymo will receive a whole new data set in the form of customer preferences and feedback, and a whole new phase of analysis and refining will begin. It's a step forward that was 4 million miles in the making.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The primary function of a car is to convey a passenger from from Point A to Point B. But the automobile also happens to be extremely well-suited for entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take music, for example. Most people no longer have Hi-Fi systems in their homes and listen to music primarily through either headphones or small Bluetooth speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cars, on the other hand, have numerous speakers and can create a true surround sound experience that enhances the listening experience. Connected cars take the experience even further, with network connectivity-enabled location services that allow drivers and passengers to learn about the area they're driving in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is the size of the screen mounted in a vehicle's dashboard. While home TVs have grown ever larger, infotainment screens in cars, with the exception of Tesla, have remained rather small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.byton.com/index.html" target="new"&gt;Byton,&lt;/a&gt; which is based in China, is looking to change that. The company introduced the Byton Concept at CES earlier this month, and one of the most noticeable features of the luxury car was its 49-inch "shared experience display" that spanned the entire dashboard from the left edge of the driver's side to the right end of the passenger side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The display screen serves as a massive infotainment center, allowing drivers to access navigation, communication or entertainment features -- or, given the screen's size and multi-function capabilities, all three at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design goes above and beyond the traditional luxury vehicle, offering features and amenities that may seem more fitting in first-class air travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Sit back, relax and feel at home," reads the &lt;a href="https://www.byton.com/concept.html" target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the concept car. "Inviting color concepts, luxury materials and traditional craftsmanship blend with flair to give a bespoke lounge experience. All our seats are designed to be individually adjustable so you can stay cozy at all times."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byton is currently manufacturing an intelligent electric car in Nanjing that will first be made available in China in 2019, and then in the US and Europe in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent vehicles expected from Byton include a sedan and a multi-purpose vehicle, which figure to include certain design elements from the Concept. While some of the vehicle's more opulent features may seem excessive, they're tailored to a specific market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Driving is not always very pleasureful in China, and most of the time you're not moving," Byton executive director of UI design Wolfram Luchner told Sean O'Kane of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/1/9/16867332/byton-electric-ev-car-ride-first-look-test-touchscreen-ces-2018" target="new"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;. "If you spend four or five hours a day in traffic, you'll want these comforts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Byton Concept is equipped with several other cool features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard-spanning screen is joined by a small eight-inch screen mounted right into the center of the steering wheel. The Byton Life Cloud Platform can sync contacts, apps and files from your smartphone with the vehicle's operating system. And keys aren't even necessary, as facial recognition cameras can provide access to the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all concept cars, the Byton Concept has design and operational elements that will likely never make it into a consumer vehicle. But the vehicle does show that China, which is emerging as an automotive power, particularly in the self-driving car space, isn't content to just make cars that can function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country also wants to produce vehicles that look good, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that will go a long way toward convincing consumers to shift allegiance from automaking countries like the US, Germany and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Today, mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) companies face a significant limiting factor: They need humans to drive the cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new development, of course, but the rapid growth of the MaaS space has made this obvious reality a frequent topic of discussion. A ride-hailing service, for example, can only service as many customers as it has active drivers. The same goes for delivery companies, which can't maximize efficiency if there's a driver shortage at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believe that the emergence of self-driving cars will change all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic is fairly simple: With tireless computer operating systems at the helm, self-driving cars will be able to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That constant operation of individual fleet vehicles figures to significantly raise the profit margin on each one, as will their ability to self-diagnose the need for maintenance exactly when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in January, &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; continued its future-facing push into the autonomous MaaS space with the announcement of a new partnership with online delivery service &lt;a href="https://postmates.com/" target="new"&gt;Postmates&lt;/a&gt;. Self-driving Fords will join Postmate's fleet of human drivers, making deliveries and collecting key data on customer experiences while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news was first unveiled by Ford CEO Jim Hackett in a speech at CES 2018 in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2011, Postmates is a mobile app-based delivery platform on which customers can order any number of things, including "a burrito, new headphones, or a fresh shirt for tonight's date," according to the company's &lt;a href="https://help.postmates.com/hc/en-us/articles/220089107-What-can-I-have-delivered-with-Postmates-" target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Much like Uber or Seamless, the app matches users with delivery personnel who procure and deliver the selected products. Customers receive an estimated delivery time and can track the status of their orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Throughout the year, Ford and Postmates will conduct pilot programs to explore how self-driving technology could change the delivery experience for consumers, enable brick-and-mortar retailers to reach new customer bases, and transform the way commerce moves in the communities in which we operate," Ford's vice president of Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification Sherif Marakby wrote in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/why-teaming-with-postmates-will-help-ford-expand-on-demand-delivery-to-everyone-c11739e76ba4" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt;. "In the future, when a consumer uses Postmates to place a purchase  -- whether for groceries, takeout or other goods -- a self-driving vehicle could be what delivers her order. As part of our testing trials, we'll study both what the merchant experience needs to be at the point of delivery and what the customer experience needs to be at that same point."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postmates joins &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735861" target="new"&gt;Domino's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736849" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; as users of Ford's self-driving partnership platform, which, according to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/coming-to-a-city-near-you-test-driving-our-autonomous-vehicle-business-27a05a2b082e" target="new"&gt;Ford vice president and president of Global Markets Jim Farley&lt;/a&gt;, plans to expand to service more businesses and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We want all types of businesses and organizations, including non-profit service providers and even individuals, to have equal opportunity to expand and enhance their role in the community," wrote Farley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having high-profile companies like Domino's, Lyft and Postmates is a natural first step. But if Ford delivers on its goals of helping smaller, mom-and-pop companies, it could scale up its operations in places beyond urban centers and establish itself in an even more dominant position.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The automotive space has become one of the most exciting sectors for investment in recent months. With electric cars, connected cars and self-driving cars all expected to grow exponentially in the near term, opportunity abounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the potential is enticing to any prospector, automotive companies, whose futures hang in the balance of these outcomes, have proven to be some of the most active investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automakers are uniquely positioned to gauge which EV, AV or connected car startups stand a legitimate chance of succeeding, and they have the resources to make meaningful investments. Plus, having an early stake in companies that could be acquired down the road, adds a valuable asset to their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, &lt;a href="https://www.alliance-2022.com/" target="new"&gt;Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi&lt;/a&gt; are looking to leverage their collective power in the space by forming an investment alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 9, the three automakers announced the launch of a new venture capital fund named Alliance Ventures. Co-located in Paris, Yokohama, Beijing and Silicon Valley, Alliance Ventures will invest up to $1 billion over the next five years in "technology and business model innovation" for electric cars, autonomous vehicles, connected cars, and other newly emerging forms of mobility. The fund plans to invest $200 million of that sum in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our open innovation approach will allow us to invest and collaborate with start-up companies and technology entrepreneurs, who will benefit from the global scale of the Alliance," Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/renault-nissan-mitsubishi-launches-a-venture-capital-fund-to-invest-up-to-1-billion-over-five-years-668507643.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "This new fund reflects the collaborative spirit and entrepreneurial mind-set at the heart of the Alliance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it launched the fund, Alliance Ventures also revealed its first investment, in Massachusetts battery company &lt;a href="http://ionicmaterials.com/" target="new"&gt;Ionic Materials&lt;/a&gt;. Along with acquiring equity in the company, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi has established a cooperative R&amp;D arrangement with Ionic Materials. The battery maker specializes in designing solid-state, cobalt-free batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We can fix lithium-ion to be safe and do all the advanced things people want to do. But we can also make [alkaline batteries that are] cheaper and safer and simple to manufacture, and make them rechargeable," Sun Microsystems founder and Ionic Materials investor Bill Joy told &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40453858/can-ionic-materials-design-a-rechargeable-battery-that-unseats-the-lithium-ion" target="new"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance was founded in 1999 as the Renault-Nissan Alliance. In October, Nissan acquired a $2.3 billion, one-third stake in Mitsubishi, which subsequently joined the Alliance. For Alliance Ventures, Renault and Nissan each hold a 40% stake, while Mitsubishi has a 20% stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New investment funds focused on the future of the automotive industry have become increasingly popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, Chinese tech giant and autonomous vehicle developer &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/21/baidu-announces-1-5b-fund-to-back-self-driving-car-startups/" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; and South Korean electronics company &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/samsung-launches-300m-autonomous-driving-fund-puts-90m-into-tttech/" target="new"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; each launched investment funds that targeted AV companies. Two months prior, the VC firm &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/13/autotech-ventures-closes-120-million-first-fund-to-connect-automotive-giants-with-emerging-startups/" target="new"&gt;Autotech Ventures&lt;/a&gt; closed a $120 million fund with the express purpose of connecting promising automotive startups with investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance currently accounts for one in nine vehicles sold worldwide. By making strategic investments in promising automotive startups, the Alliance is making a long-term play to widen its slice of that pie.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In theory, there's no reason why a fully autonomous vehicle would need pedals or a steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a driverless car is turning, accelerating and braking entirely on its own, the auto parts that allow humans to perform these tasks become redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing unnecessary hardware would create more interior space in cars and allow automakers to design more effective safety systems. Plus, if you subscribe to the belief that, in the future, autonomous systems will be better at driving safely than humans by an order of magnitude, then there's an argument to be made that self-driving cars shouldn't enable people to pilot their cars at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of that makes it less unusual to see a car interior designed without a steering wheel or pedals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's a bit strange to look at the fourth generation concept of &lt;a href="http://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;'s electric self-driving car, the Cruise AV, which was revealed at CES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cruise AV's design eliminates the steering wheel and pedals completely, and this is not some design exercise that will never see the light of day. GM said that the vehicle will begin testing on roads in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;Center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvP82IsGqNc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By integrating our self-driving system into the vehicle from the beginning, and through close coordination between the hardware and software teams, we have evaluated potential failure modes for all systems, and addressed them throughout development to ensure a safe and reliable product," GM wrote in a comprehensive &lt;a href="http://www.gm.com/content/dam/gm/en_us/english/selfdriving/gmsafetyreport.pdf" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; framed as a self-driving safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This comprehensive, integrated approach to safety, combined with testing in one of the most complex environments in the world, allows us to safely take the next step -- elimination of the steering wheel, pedals and other manual controls -- from the vehicle," according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing in complex environments has consistently been a key aspect for &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt;, GM's self-driving subsidiary. This past October, CEO Kyle Vogt described why the company primarily tests its vehicles on the chaotic streets of San Francisco, not so subtly throwing shade at &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; and other AV developers that largely test driverless cars on the calmer, more uniform streets of suburban Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

{image 1}

&lt;p&gt;"Testing in the hardest places first means we'll get to scale faster than starting with the easier ones," Vogt &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737053" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "This may seem counterintuitive, but by testing in densely populated areas we expose our software to unusual situations at a much higher rate, which means we can improve our software at a much higher rate. Based on our experience, every minute of testing in San Francisco is about as valuable as an hour of testing in the suburbs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2019 testing date of the wheel-less, pedal-less Cruise AV is in line with the timeframe that GM and Cruise have given for introducing their &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738822" target="new"&gt;driverless ride-hailing program&lt;/a&gt;. Much is still not known about that initiative, including where it will launch ("dense urban environments" is all that's been said publicly so far).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by developing a concept vehicle that is so radically removed from those currently on the road, GM and Cruise are continuing their philosophy of taking big steps early on in the process, instead of a series of baby steps. It's a bold approach that could pay off big.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It's a familiar scenario. It's 5:30 p.m. and you're leaving a meeting in an unfamiliar part of town. You don't remember exactly where you parked, and you need to make it to the store before it closes. You don't know when the store closes, though, and you don't know how to get there from where you are. Of course, you can worry about that once you actually find your car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't have to be that way. Imagine a situation where you're leaving a meeting in an unfamiliar part of town and you don't need to remember where you left your car, because your phone tells you. It also calculates exactly how long it will take you to get to the store -- your walk to your car included -- and determines whether you'll make it there before it closes. It's a stress-free evening (depending, of course, on how your meeting went).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter situation is what &lt;a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/" target="new"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; is hoping to give its drivers &lt;a href="http://blog.caranddriver.com/bmw-connected-brings-remote-3d-security-cam-microsoft-email-integration-and-more/" target="new"&gt;with the Connected+ platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Connected+ offers a wide variety of features and services in addition to the aforementioned navigation features," according to Car and Driver. Much of its appeal comes from its ability to integrate the operations of the car and the cellphone, allowing users to switch seamlessly between their mobile device and the car's dashboard display without so much as re-entering their destination or changing the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, BMW launched ConnectedDrive, a series of apps that allowed drivers to connect with their cars from their phones. In March of last year, the automaker consolidated those services into a single app known as BMW Connected, which let drivers send driving directions from their phone to their cars, remotely lock and unlock their cars and cool or warm their vehicles minutes before getting into it.&lt;/p&gt;
{image 1}
&lt;p&gt;Connected+ incorporates all of those features and builds upon them. When driving to meet someone, users can have their car send an ETA to contacts synced from their phone. There's a more advanced version of this feature, where a URL can be sent to contacts that lets them follow the driver in real time using GPS. (This might be a little invasive for most, but one can imagine the parents of a teen driver finding it useful as a means of ensuring safety.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the anxiety that surrounds the ordeal of parking for so many drivers, many BMW owners will find relief in the related capabilities of Connected+, which shows users their parking options as they near their destinations. Another common point of driving stress is addressed by a different Connected+ feature, which recognizes when the fuel tank is running low, offers the driver several options for gas stations and integrates the resulting fuel stop into its ETA calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last feature is especially exciting for those invested in the future of automobiles, as its interpretation of diagnostic information -- from the gas tank, in this instance -- into driving solutions represents the type of functionality that many believe will come to define the connected car. Thanks to Connected+'s nature as a platform, there's reason to believe that more such offerings are on the way: BMW plans to update or add to the service at least once every two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In February, Embark CEO Alex Rodrigues laid out some ambitious plans for his company in the months that lay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The big thing for us is going to be hiring more people," Rodrigues told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/24/14713700/embark-self-driving-truck-tractor-trailer" target="new"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;. "We're scaling up really aggressively and bringing on more people to really get into every nook and cranny of the edge cases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That mission just got a lot easier for &lt;a href="http://embarktrucks.com/" target="new"&gt;Embark&lt;/a&gt;, as the company announced July 18 that it had raised $15 million in a Series A financing round led by venture capital fund Data Collective. Also joining in the round were Maven Ventures, YC Continuity and SV Angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Embark's seed round included Maven Ventures, among others. The company's valuation now sits at $75 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embark doesn't concern itself with building trucks or the self-driving hardware that would direct them, but rather on the underlying software and the platform that will enable them to operate autonomously. The company built its first test prototype attached to a Peterbilt 579 truck and put it on the road in Nevada last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time the company announced its Series A financing, Embark also announced &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/self-driving-truck-startup-embark-raises-15m-partners-with-peterbilt/?ncid=rss" target="new"&gt;a formal partnership with Peterbilt&lt;/a&gt;. The trucking giant will now be building the test trucks for Embark at Peterbilt's Texas factory. The partnership will allow Embark to have trucks more customized for its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal of self-driving freight trucks is obvious. The absence of human drivers eliminates the need to stop for sleep, food or fuel. (They'd carry enough fuel for any given journey, refueling once they reached their destination.) Deliveries would be faster and performed with more efficiency, thereby making them considerably more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone is so happy about the impending revolution in long-haul trucking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, there are 1.6 million drivers operating tractor-trailer trucks on the roads. &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state" target="new"&gt;According to NPR&lt;/a&gt;, it's the most common job in more than half of the 50 states. It would not be an overstatement to say that all of these people losing their jobs over the course of, say, a decade would be catastrophic to the American job market -- not to mention similar effects in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embark, though, has no intentions of replacing truck drivers. They merely plan to use them differently. The majority of a truck's trip would be self-directed, as the truck would drive itself on the highway. For autonomous vehicles, though, many consider city driving to be a far greater challenge. To address this, drivers would pick up Embark-driven trucks at stations on the highway just outside of cities, driving them manually to drop off their freight at their final destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps counterintuitively, Rodrigues believes such a change would benefit drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our expectation is that the salary for truck drivers will go up," Rodrigues said in The Verge interview. According to him, "Interactions with the customer, individual pickup and drop off, and the harder parts of truck driving," are all skills that would make drivers remain valuable in the new trucking economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embark's website espouses the company's blue collar spirit. "Something critical is lost when invention becomes untethered from the garage," it reads. "While others spend billions to develop self-driving on large corporate campuses, we believe that teamwork, passion, and an intense focus on the users of our technology will win out over raw size."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a plan for truckers to maintain their jobs will certainly endear Embark to many currently in the industry, and such a garage mentality doesn't hurt, either. When self-driving truck companies look to take their products to the road, those with unions and drivers on their side could hold a distinct advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;New York City, particularly Manhattan, might be the single most stressful city in the United States to drive a car. Cyclists zoom by you on either side; taxi drivers honk their horns and scream at you when you've done nothing wrong; and making a turn inevitably means maneuvering through hordes of pedestrians, many of whom are on their cellphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the challenges of driving in New York pale in comparison to commuting using the city's public transit, which lives -- and often dies -- on outdated and failing infrastructure. The transportation situation in NYC could clearly benefit from a technology upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to imagine how driverless cars could improve the situation, and that's exactly what &lt;a href="http://edgdesign.com/" target="new"&gt;architecture and design firm EDG&lt;/a&gt; did with a new plan called Loop NYC. Aiming to make city driving safer and more efficient, the plan proposes a solution within the city's current grid layout to create autonomous vehicle-only lanes at some of Manhattan's most critical points of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"NYC, like so many urban centers, is facing an imminent infrastructure crisis as the continuous influx of residents will soon be insupportable," EDG founder and managing partner &lt;a href="https://www.6sqft.com/loop-nyc-proposes-driverless-auto-expressways-across-manhattan-and-a-13-mile-pedestrian-park/" target="new"&gt;John J. Meyer wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "As a proactive response to the inevitable driverless vehicle technology, we created a solution that is simultaneously simple and implementable by automating a portion of the traffic grid with driverless vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225812017?portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While optimizing Manhattan for driverless vehicles will be anything from easy, EDG's proposal is quite simple in concept. The West Side Highway and FDR Drive, the major roads that border the island on its west and east sides, would each hold two lanes -- one in each direction -- to accommodate autonomous vehicles exclusively. Major cross streets such as 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd, 57th, 86th and 110th Streets would become expressways for driverless cars only, allowing for incredibly efficient traffic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We calculated the efficiency of Loop NYC to go from Grand Central to Lower Manhattan and back," &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX2aBnM9DMw" target="new"&gt;EDG notes in a video&lt;/a&gt; touting its proposal. "A route that would traditionally take 45 minutes now would only take 11 minutes. An average New Yorker would save 30 minutes a day on their commute, and over a lifetime would get back more than a year."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan also presents solutions for the city's pedestrians, who become &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/nyregion/new-york-city-overcrowded-sidewalks.html" target="new"&gt;more and more tightly packed onto sidewalks&lt;/a&gt; with each passing year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overpasses and underpasses would separate walkers from self-driving cars, easing congestion on street-level sidewalks in the process. An idea that will seem even more radical to long-time New Yorkers is a 13-mile "pedestrian park" that would stretch from Battery Park through Union Square before extending further up Broadway and Park Avenue. EDG's images of these parks &lt;a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90133918/could-driverless-cars-turn-manhattan-into-a-lush-pedestrian-paradise" target="new"&gt;are strikingly green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A million different technological, social and political factors will determine if and when a plan such as Loop NYC will be viable in Manhattan or other major cities. However, the proposal is encouraging in its specificity and creativity. The innovators of today are already imagining our driverless car future in vivid detail.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you own one, you're likely familiar with the types of apps most connected cars feature on their dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers can sync their contacts to their automobiles so they can make hands-free phone calls with a voice command. They can jam out to pretty much any song in the world on demand with streaming music services like Spotify. And they can, of course, plug in a destination and have the car navigate them turn by turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this functionality is impressive and, relative to the history of consumer automobiles, quite new. So many drivers probably aren't thinking about what's next in connected car apps. But they will be soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the world's largest automakers, General Motors, has &lt;a href="http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2017/jul/0721-app.html" target="new"&gt;launched GM Dev Client&lt;/a&gt; for developers looking to create consumer apps for GM cars' infotainment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dev Client is an extension of &lt;a href="https://developer.gm.com/ngi" target="new"&gt;Next Generation Infotainment SDK&lt;/a&gt;, a development platform that GM launched in January and addresses one of its biggest pain points. The problem with the previous platform was that once developers created their apps, they had to travel in person to General Motors in Detroit to actually test them on vehicles. With Dev Client, app builders will now be able to see how their creations perform on their own GM vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sharing more emulated data points through the SDK than any other automaker was the first step in opening the door for developers," Kent Helfrich, executive director of Connected Ecosystem Integration at GM, wrote. "After such strong adoption of the SDK, we wanted to enable developers to take the next step and allow real-world testing in our vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new offering from GM opens up certain tools for third-party developers, it is not a completely open platform. Apps built in the SDK will still need to be approved before they can be tested in the vehicles. It is unclear what GM's standards are for app suitability and how rigorously they might apply them going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of collaboration in the connected car space has been a hot topic recently, with new partnerships between automakers, software developers and others announced on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;nuTonomy CEO Karl Iagnemma spoke about the subject recently &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/07/11/driverless-tech-pioneer-predicts-multiple-winners-in-autonomous-car-race/#443a2ce171a4" target="new"&gt;with Forbes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the automotive domain, generally speaking, when you look at consortium models, the groups that have leading technology are less incentivized to contribute to the consortia," Iagnemma said. "There's a potential end state where you have participants that are not market leaders. And with a large field of participants that aren't leaders, there's no guarantee that just by combining resources they'll end up with a winning solution."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the pursuit of an improved connected car infotainment system is a competition that looks like it may have many winners. Going forward, GM is going to include infotainment systems in a larger number of its cars, and inviting more developers to the table will yield more app offerings. With more offerings, the cream will rise to the top and users will be rewarded with a better experience from their infotainment systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Wireless machine-to-machine (M2M) technology has a nearly infinite number of potential applications, and is one of the foundational components of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a "smart home" is already gaining traction, as more customers adjust the temperature of their house before they even pull into the driveway or remotely turn off lights. Wearable gadgets such as Fitbit use sensors to track user behavior, and then communicate with apps to visualize data and provide users with valuable insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the enterprise side, one of the biggest M2M opportunities is in the commercial fleet management sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.berginsight.com/ShowReport.aspx?m_m=3&amp;amp;id=258" target="new"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;new report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released by &lt;a href="http://www.berginsight.com/" target="new"&gt;Berg Insight&lt;/a&gt;, a Swedish market research firm that specializes in M2M and IoT, finds that the number of active management systems in North American commercial vehicle fleets will grow from 6.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 13.5 million by 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Berg study is also bearish on automotive M2M growth elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. In Latin America, the number of active fleet management systems is expected to grow from 2.5 million to 4.7 million, a 12.9% increase in CAGR terms, over the same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The OEM telematics initiatives in the Americas have intensified in recent years and most vehicle manufacturers now offer factory-installed fleet telematics solutions either independently or through partnerships with established aftermarket fleet management solution providers," Rickard Andersson, a senior analyst at Berg Insight, &lt;a href="https://iotbusinessnews.com/2017/07/21/30955-installed-base-fleet-management-systems-americas-will-exceed-18-million-units-2021/" target="new"&gt;told IoT Business News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the report acknowledges that fleet management is an "ambiguous term," it defines it as "a vehicle-based system that incorporates data logging, satellite positioning and data communication to a back-office application." The report also offers insight on how fleet management has a longer history than some may realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On-board vehicle computers first emerged in the 1980s and were soon connected to various satellite and terrestrial wireless networks," according to the report. "Today, mobile networks can provide ubiquitous online connectivity in many regions at a reasonable cost and mobile computing technology delivers very high performance, as well as excellent usability."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=898"target="new"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; is the market leader in fleet management systems due in large part to its acquisitions of Telogis and Fleetmatics. Trimble, Geotab, Omnitracs and Zonar are also emerging as serious players in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While commercial fleets may be leading the charge in the adoption of M2M technology, the larger automotive sector isn't far behind. &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3105021/mobile-wireless/vehicles-to-make-up-98-of-m2m-traffic-by-2021.html" target="new"&gt;A 2016 study by Juniper Research&lt;/a&gt; predicted that vehicles will make up 98% of M2M traffic by the year 2021. Mobile network operators are surely thrilled by the projected growth, and consumers should be as well, as the capabilities of their vehicles will soon expand greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It's a scene that has been mined for comedy several times over the years in film and television: A luxury car owner pulls up to a fancy event in a spotless ride. Suspiciously, the owner eyes the teenaged valet parking attendant before reluctantly handing over the keys. As soon as the owner walks away, his worst fears are confirmed when the valet burns rubber into the parking garage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the latest collaborative project from &lt;a href="https://www.daimler.com/en/" target="new"&gt;Daimler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bosch.us/en/us/our_company_1/our-company-lp.html" target="new"&gt;Bosch&lt;/a&gt; is a success, that scene may become a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late July, the two automotive titans &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/24/daimler-and-bosch-create-a-driverless-parking-garage/" target="new"&gt;launched an automated valet parking system&lt;/a&gt; in Stuttgart, Germany at the &lt;a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/museum/" target="new"&gt;Mercedes-Benz Museum&lt;/a&gt;'s garage. The establishment now gives visitors a glimpse into the future of automobiles while visiting a venue that celebrates its past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are approaching autonomous driving faster than many people suspect," &lt;a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/innovation/avp-bosch-and-daimler-show-driverless-parking-in-real-life-traffic/" target="new"&gt;Dr. Michael Hafner&lt;/a&gt;, head of Automated Driving and Active Safety at Mercedes-Benz Cars Development, wrote in a statement. "The driverless parking solution at the Mercedes-Benz Museum demonstrates in impressive fashion just how far the technology has come."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjrUbXClAOE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the valet system serves more as an attraction and testing site than a service for guests. Visitors won't be able to use it until 2018. The garage's V2X infrastructure, provided by Bosch, works in conjunction with sensors and other onboard technology on equipped Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The car's sensors communicate with the garage's sensors to smoothly direct the car to an open parking spot. Drivers check in their car with a smartphone app, and also use the app to retrieve their car from the garage -- or, more accurately, ask the car to retrieve itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Parking will be an automated process in the future," Gerhard Steiger, director of the Chassis Systems Control unit at Bosch, wrote in a statement. "By applying an intelligent multi-story car park infrastructure and networking it with vehicles, we have managed to realize driverless parking substantially earlier than planned."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the development of the parking garage's connectivity, Bosch and Daimler worked extensively with various regulatory bodies, including the Stuttgart regional council, Germany's federal transport ministry and the TV Rheinland technical inspection authority. Now the facility is active, the coming months will see various testing and trials to make sure it is safe and functioning properly. If the museum receives approval from these regulators -- which could happen as soon as early next year -- visitors with compatible Mercedes-Benz vehicles will be free to use the service, and the hassle of finding a parking spot (and remembering it when you come back) will disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since seeing is believing, the garage already serves a very useful function. As the rare public site where the average person can witness a car operate autonomously, it could go a long way toward convincing people of autonomous vehicles' viability and boost public perception of connected cars. And once people avoid the nuisances of parking entirely for themselves, it's hard to imagine they'll ever want to go back to the old way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;What does it take for something to be considered a "real" self-driving car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autopilot-equipped Teslas and the new Audi A8 can't drive themselves everywhere, but these vehicles can take over for drivers for hours at a time. If we're waiting for autonomous vehicles to operate on a higher plane than that, however, it could be a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means calling a vehicle a "real" driverless car is still largely subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way though, that makes it all the more powerful. With no real standard to go by, the burden of proof is on the automaker to demonstrate that a creation is truly a breakthrough. So when Kyle Vogt, founder and CEO of GM's &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt;, published a Medium post under the title "How we built the first self-driving car (really)," he was throwing down the gauntlet to the rest of the AV development world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tA_VvHP0-s"&gt;videos we've previously released&lt;/a&gt; show the most advanced self-driving software ever demonstrated, the most critical requirement for deployment at scale is actually the ability to manufacture the cars that run that software," &lt;a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/how-we-built-the-first-real-self-driving-car-really-bd17b0dbda55" target="new"&gt;writes Vogt&lt;/a&gt; in the September 11 post. "So, today, we're unveiling the world's first mass-producible car designed to operate without a driver. This isn't just a concept design -- it has airbags, crumple zones, and comfortable seats. It's assembled in a high-volume assembly plant capable of producing 100,000's of vehicles per year, and we'd like to keep that plant busy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Vogt's post spends far more time describing the process by which Cruise designed this new car than he does describing the vehicle itself, he does offer some details -- most of which are framed in relation to previous Cruise AV designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vogt states that the new cars "have almost completely new and fault-tolerant electrical, communication, and actuation systems that are unique to a driverless vehicle." He also says that the vehicle's wiring harness has 4,085 wires and 1,066 connectors, which he claims leaves little margin for error in his company's work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Without rigor and process, vehicles will spend most of their time in the shop while technicians chase 'ghosts' (chafed wires, loose connectors, or anything else that causes things to suddenly stop working)," he writes. "As you can imagine, achieving massive scale with a low defect rate and high reliability is ridiculously hard ... So you really need a well-run assembly plant to build something that works, such as the billion dollar plant we're using in Lake Orion, MI."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vogt notes that a certain number of the cars bearing Cruise's latest design will join the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735421" target="new"&gt;ride-sharing fleet&lt;/a&gt; that shuttles the company's employees in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the law requires, they'll still have a driver behind the wheel ready and waiting to take over operations if necessary. Before then, we hope to get a closer look at the car that Vogt touts so enthusiastically. Between the boldness of his words and the scarcity of detail that he provides, it's reasonable to expect more information on the car in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talk around self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles that exists in the abstract. Seeing artists' renderings or even photographs on a computer screen elicits a very different reaction than seeing one with your own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents of California, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, where autonomous vehicles are regularly tested, get to witness the real deal on a semi-frequent basis. But even there, federal and state laws currently require that all AVs have a human in the driver's seat to monitor the operation of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current climate, it's understandable that other road actors would freak out if they saw a car driving around with no occupants at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly what residents of Northern Virginia did in August, when a &lt;a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/transit-connect-passenger-van-wagon/2017/" target="new"&gt;Transit Connect van&lt;/a&gt; that appeared to have an empty driver's seat spent a total of 150 hours on the road. In reality, though, the car did have a human driver -- he just happened to be wearing an incredibly detailed camouflage outfit that made him look like a vacant car seat. While certainly meant in part to garner online attention -- and the project did yield an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwujR1ARsog" target="new"&gt;amusing video&lt;/a&gt; -- it was much more than a viral prank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As part of a joint project between Ford and the &lt;a href="http://www.vtti.vt.edu/index.html" target="new"&gt;Virginia Tech Transportation Institute&lt;/a&gt;, the goal of dressing a man up like a car seat was to research how pedestrians, cyclists and drivers respond to the presence of an autonomous vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EwujR1ARsog?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how self-driving vehicles impact the world as we know it today is critical to ensuring we're creating the right experience for tomorrow," &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/09/13/ford-virginia-tech-autonomous-vehicle-human-testing.html" target="new"&gt;John Shutko&lt;/a&gt;, human factors technical specialist at Ford, noted in a statement. "We need to solve for the challenges presented by not having a human driver, so designing a way to replace the head nod or hand wave is fundamental to ensuring safe and efficient operation of self-driving vehicles in our communities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To replace those signals that humans can make but driverless cars cannot, Ford and Virginia Tech devised a light bar that was placed across the top of the car's windshield. To indicate that the car was about to come to a full stop, the car flashed two white lights that moved side-to-side across the windshield. To show that it was preparing to accelerate after stopping, a blinking white light flashed. And to indicate that the vehicle was driving autonomously (which it wasn't, actually), the car projected a solid white light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no pedestrians or drivers that encountered the vehicle had been briefed on these signals. In creating the light patterns, engineers hoped to establish intuitive cues that gave pedestrians, cyclists and anyone else a clear idea of the intentions of an autonomous system. To assess the effectiveness of the lights, designers mounted the van with 360-degree HD cameras to track responses to the car's behavior. Developers are now reviewing this footage to see where they succeeded and where they can improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This work is of value not only to vehicle users and manufacturers, but also to anyone who walks, rides or drives alongside autonomous vehicles in the future," said Andy Schaudt, project director at the Center for Automated Vehicle Systems at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As autonomous vehicles become commonplace in the future, there will certainly be a standard for these types of signals that will remain consistent across all makes and models. But in order to get to that point, research such as this is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preparing for a self-driving future is going to take all of us working together," said Shutko. "That's why we're developing and advocating for a standard solution so it can be adopted by the industry and applied to all self-driving vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When Volkswagen unveiled its self-driving "Sedric" concept this past March, some people couldn't help but chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn't have anything to do with the underlying concept, which was that Sedric would be "the ideas platform for autonomous driving in the &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/" target="new"&gt;Volkswagen Group&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, it was the physical appearance of the car. With a wide body, a vertically elongated windshield and hanging wheel wells covering the tires completely, it looked like nothing that is on the road today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jalopnik called it a "&lt;a href="http://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-sedric-is-an-autonomous-space-caterpilla-1793018719" target="new"&gt;space caterpillar&lt;/a&gt;." The Verge said it looked like a "&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/6/14832354/volkswagen-sedric-self-driving-van-concept-mobility" target="new"&gt;pissed-off toaster&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playful barbs aside, most outlets still had to give credit to the Sedric concept and the ambition of its innovative design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to Volkswagen Group's presentation at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt, we have a better idea of VW's plans for Sedric and its broader approach to autonomous vehicles. As reported by &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170917/MOBILITY/170919808/vw-autonomous-fleet" target="new"&gt;Automotive News&lt;/a&gt;, the Group has set 2021 as a target date for the launch of Level 5 autonomous electric vehicles of various kinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our team is already working on ideas for a whole Sedric family of fully autonomous vehicles for the city, for luxurious long-range mobility, through self-driving delivery vans and heavy commercial trucks," Volkswagen AG CEO Matthias Muller said in Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also announced plans to introduce autonomous ride-sharing services in two to five cities around the globe by 2021, via the mobility brands &lt;a href="https://www.moia.io/" target="new"&gt;Moia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gett.com/juno/" target="new"&gt;Gett&lt;/a&gt; with which Volkswagen is affiliated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when it first introduced Sedric in March, the company described an innovative-sounding system by which customers will hail rides in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A single touch of the button guarantees mobility for everyone, at any time, and at any location," read the &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/detailpage/-/detail/Individual-mobility-redefined-Autonomous-driving-at-the-touch-of-a-button/view/4669348/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The control element is made of a button to press and a ring which indicates Sedric's arrival time with colored signals and vibration signal that guides a person with impaired vision to the car."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest information on Sedric also provided additional perspective on the vehicle's unusual design, which Volkswagen head of design Michael Mauer said is engineered to make passengers feel comfortable and safe as they are first introduced to AV technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Powerful bodywork pillars, distinctive wheelhouses and short overhangs give Sedric an impressively robust appearance as the epitome of safety and trustworthiness," &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/detailpage/-/detail/The-Volkswagen-Group-provides-an-insight-into-the-SEDRIC-model-family/view/5593310/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da?p_p_auth=l45HeJ08" target="new"&gt;Mauer noted in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The headlamps provide a design feature and take on the function of eyes. They make visual contact with people in the immediate surroundings and interact with them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Volkswagen can deliver on its timeline, the company could have the first self-driving cars that consumers will ride in for purposeful transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These intentions have clearly informed the company's approach to design and user experience. Both the ride-sharing and ride-hailing plans, as well as Sedric's incredibly safe-looking physical design, are meant to put customers at ease with early AV experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course a car that &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; safe is different from one that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; safe, and Volkswagen has a number of hurdles to overcome in order to regain consumer trust after its emissions scandal. But if VW is successful in its autonomous efforts, it could not only erase some of the sins of the past, it could also make the company a leader for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For people who grew up in a household with satellite television, there's a good chance they associate the technology with some level of inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably tales of dads injuring themselves while climbing on the roof in the snow to adjust the satellite dish's position so the family could watch a certain show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early GPS or satellite radio service users are also familiar with a similar frustration from losing navigation or the sound of Howard Stern's voice because it was a cloudy day. The result is a lingering perception that satellite transmission is a fickle technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in recent years, however, have done a great deal to improve the performance of satellite-based services. In particular, the proliferation of high-throughput satellites (HTS) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have made many of these services faster, cheaper and more widely available. It's a development that has empowered a variety of providers of satellite services, with one of the foremost being connectivity company &lt;a href="https://www.kymetacorp.com/" target="new"&gt;Kymeta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 20 at the 2017 Visionary Satellite Access Technology (VSAT) Global conference in London, Kymeta chief commercial officer Bill Marks revealed that the company had shipped its first 400 flat-panel antennas from its West Coast headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have antennas in eight different platforms, in five different verticals, most of which are mobile, one is fixed," &lt;a href="http://spacenews.com/kymeta-ships-first-400-flat-panel-antennas-confirms-talks-with-oneweb/" target="new"&gt;Marks&lt;/a&gt; noted. "We are seeing antennas going on trains, buses, boats and automobiles, construction sites, first responders and agriculture."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thin, white hexagon, the Kymeta &lt;a href="https://www.kymetacorp.com/kymeta-products/" target="new"&gt;mTenna&lt;/a&gt; product is visually striking. When in use, though, it's invisible. The MTenna can sit between the headliner and the roof of an automobile, measuring between eight to 12 centimeters in depth. At that size, it can fit into the OEM specifications for roof design of nearly all cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The satellite's connection speeds are fast. It can download at speeds up to 50 megabytes per second and upload at 10 Mbps. According to Brian Wang at &lt;a href="https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2017/09/kymetas-flat-antenna-will-enable-the-broadband-connected-cars.html#solidopinion" target="new"&gt;Next Big Future&lt;/a&gt;, it will operate at "5000 times the spectrum and capacity of cellphones" as more and more low earth orbit satellite networks are established in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, of course, would mean an explosion in connected car performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the potential applications for Kymeta's products extend beyond just the consumer vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are lots of platforms that have not been able to take advantage of satellite before because of the nature of the platform," Marks said. "Trains are a good example of that. You can't put a mechanically steered antenna on top of a train because in a tunnel it would get knocked off so we are seeing a great success in markets that have never really used satellite before."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marks also said at the conference that thousands of back-ordered 70-centimeter Ku antennas entered production at a Californian assembly line late in September. Given the purported power of Kymeta's products, it's no wonder they're in such high demand.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to testing prototypes, autonomous vehicle developers don't tend to interact much with their competitors. Obviously, companies aren't fond of sharing their trade secrets with one another while they're still in the testing phase -- or afterward for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="http://gomentumstation.net/" target="new"&gt;GoMentum Station&lt;/a&gt; may not be a self-driving car utopia where autonomous vehicle designers from different companies meet, network and test their products on specially-designed tracks, it's not that far off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the Northern California town of Oxnard, GoMentum is a former naval weapons station that has been converted into a 5,000 acre, state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle research center. The company has partnerships with a number of AV initiatives, and that list of partners grew longer in late October when GoMentum announced news of a collaboration with the &lt;a href="http://www.tri.global/" target="_new"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; (TRI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The benefits of driverless technology are many, but the most important one is increased safety. TRI's work in the artificial intelligence arena is vital to advancing autonomous vehicle technology," &lt;a href="http://pressroom.toyota.com/releases/driverless+technology+advances+with+partnership+between+toyota+research+institute+and+gomentum+stat.htm" target="new"&gt;Randy Iwasaki&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of the Contra Costa Transit Authority -- the public agency that operates GoMentum Station -- noted in a statement. "The statistics are clear: lives will be saved by reducing a vehicle's reliance on human drivers, and we are excited to see the progress TRI will make to perfect driverless and driver-aided technology at GoMentum Station."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subsidiary of Toyota North America, the Toyota Research Institute was founded in 2015 to pursue advancements ranging from vehicular safety to vehicular autonomy. Part of that pursuit involves investing in outside entities. In July, TRI announced it had invested $5 million in the &lt;a href="http://www.acmwillowrun.org/" target="new"&gt;American Center for Mobility&lt;/a&gt;, a Michigan AV facility not unlike GoMentum Station. In announcing the investment, TRI CEO Gill Pratt espoused the value of private driverless test sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As we move forward with the development of autonomous cars, we must remember that not all test miles are created equal," Pratt &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735137" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. "The road to creating a car as safe, or safer, than a human driver will require billions of test miles including simulation, real-world driving on public roads, and closed-course testing where we can expose our systems to extreme circumstances and conditions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At GoMentum Station, TRI will test two different versions of its autonomous technology, which go by the names of Guardian and Chauffeur. The first refers to advanced driver-assistance system technology that features some autonomous aspects. The second refers to the operations of a fully self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The addition of GoMentum Station to TRI's arsenal of automated vehicle test locations allows us to create hazardous driving scenarios for advancing capabilities of both Guardian and Chauffeur and further develop our technology," said TRI VP of autonomous driving Ryan Eustice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the miles of testing that AVs get on public roads are invaluable, closed courses allow for an economy of testing in which developers can repeatedly present autonomous systems with rare, challenging situations that they might not run into otherwise. When self-driving cars are on our roads in earnest, they'll need to be ready for anything.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Lots of attention is given to self-driving cars that are tested on public roads, and it's easy to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicle systems gain invaluable experience and information on streets, which they are then able to synthesize to improve their understanding of real-world traffic patterns. Plus, the knowledge that self-driving cars are already testing on public roadways generates public excitement and anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while they may get less attention, private testing facilities are just as important in the development of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every self-driving car you see testing on the roads is the product of countless hours of testing in a private setting. And there's no expiration date on their usefulness: The automotive innovations of tomorrow are being tested on closed courses right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, one of the nation's most forward-thinking states when it comes to autonomous vehicles -- Michigan -- is home to one of the best closed-course AV testing facilities, &lt;a href="https://mcity.umich.edu/our-work/mcity-test-facility/" target="new"&gt;Mcity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located on the University of Michigan's North Campus in Ann Arbor, the 32-acre site represents a public-private initiative for the research and development of self-driving cars. And in late October, the project received $11 million in a second round of industry funding that will help Mcity continue to be one of the nation's premier autonomous testing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mcity has quickly risen to be one of Michigan's strongest assets and a national leader in autonomous vehicle research and development," &lt;a href="http://www.ns.umich.edu/new/releases/25206-industry-partners-invest-in-second-phase-of-mcity-funding" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Michigan Governor Rick Snyder. "The state of Michigan clearly sees the value in having the facility and research in our mobility ecosystem, but the private sector is continuing to show support and interest in the advancements that come from the facility, as well. I congratulate Mcity on their continued partnerships and outstanding success."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all of the AV accomplishments that have taken place at Mcity, its very existence surely ranks among the most impressive and encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facility exists as a joint effort between the University of Michigan and the state department of transportation, as well as a long list of companies that are ostensibly competitors. Eleven companies spanning a range of automotive sectors contributed to this latest round of funding, including Delphi Automotive, GM, Intel, LG Electronic and State Farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Launching Mcity was in itself a grand experiment," noted Mcity director Huei Peng. "How might companies representing such a broad range of industries, including many who compete with each other, be able to effectively work together? The experiment has proven to be a very successful model where these companies have been able to work collaboratively and productively to explore questions about connected and automated vehicles that no single company or industry can address alone."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the research at Mcity involves the direct development of autonomous driving technology, a good amount of it also considers larger questions about the implementation of self-driving cars on our roads, as well as more niche issues that will impact our AV future. The facility's projects &lt;a href="https://mcity.umich.edu/our-work/research/" target="new""&gt;include&lt;/a&gt; "Explanations and Expectations: Trust Building in Autonomous Vehicles," "The Driver in the Driverless Car," and "Fuel Economy Optimization of Heavy-duty Vehicles using Connected Vehicle Technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total investment in Mcity and the school's &lt;a href="http://www.umtri.umich.edu/" target="new"&gt;Transportation Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; will reach $100 million by 2020, according to the university. Considering what they have achieved thus far, it's thrilling to imagine the discoveries those added resources will help facilitate in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are no shortage of Goliaths in the race to develop autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major automakers such as Ford, GM and Toyota have abundant money and resources at their disposal to pour into AVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ditto for "Big Tech" companies. As much as they still like to think of themselves as scrappy little startups, it's impossible to look at places such as Waymo, which is owned by Google parent company Alphabet, and Uber as underdogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real Davids in the self-driving vehicle space are the genuine startups, small companies with just a few employees that are creating new technology and developing fresh solutions to old problems. That is what makes these companies, which often get their start at university research facilities, so attractive to investors. The chance to get in early on a company that has a high potential upside is tough to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is certainly the case for Boston-based autonomous vehicle startup &lt;a href="http://optimusride.com/" target="new"&gt;Optimus Ride&lt;/a&gt;, which closed an $18 million Series A round of funding in early November. The investment was led by Greycroft Partners, with Emerson Collective, Fraser McCombs Capital and venture capitalist Joi Ito also participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Autonomy is currently revolutionizing the transportation industry." wrote Greycroft partner John Elton in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fully-autonomous-vehicle-developer-optimus-ride-raises-18-million-in-series-a-funding-300548301.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The changes will impact not only transportation users' free time, but the broader world with a safer, more environmentally friendly and inclusive transportation system. Greycroft is thrilled to partner with the Optimus Ride team. They are a diverse group that combines the top technical talent in computer vision and machine learning with expertise in urban design."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimus Ride is currently developing a "fully autonomous (Level 4) system for electric vehicle fleets."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company was founded in 2015 by Ryan Chin, who previously was in charge of the City Science Initiative at the MIT Media Lab. Three other MIT professors joined him as co-founders. While self-driving cars are undeniably a glamorous and futuristic technology, Chin and his team are more concerned with the societal good that can be brought about by the proliferation of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Where we should be, from a societal point of view, is [an arrangement where] autonomous jitneys that pick people up, drive them, have maximum utilization, and that don't park for very long except for recharging," &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/optimus-ride-wants-autonomous-ridesharing-without-human-drivers-in-the-way" target="new"&gt;Chin&lt;/a&gt; told IEEE Spectrum last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimus Ride tested a prototype for visually impaired students and faculty at Boston's Perkins School for the Blind &lt;a href="http://www.perkins.org/stories/news/driverless-vehicle-tested-at-perkins" target="new"&gt;last September&lt;/a&gt; and has received approval to test highly automated vehicles in Massachusetts from the state's Department of Transportation. It has also reached an agreement with the city of Boston to test within city limits. Now, with a total of $23.25 million raised through two rounds of financing, Optimus has the capability to carry out that testing in full force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have known the Optimus Ride team since the very beginning of their journey as entrepreneurs, and it's been rewarding to serve as a mentor to them up to this point," said Ito, who is the director of the MIT Media Lab. "They embody the type of innovation truly interdisciplinary teams can achieve, and I'm excited to continue to support their success in the years ahead."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of Americans die every year in car accidents. It's a horrific reality, but one that has become normalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of drunk driving and texting while driving, seldom do you see campaigns that raise awareness about general traffic accidents and the deaths that arise from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest benefits of self-driving cars is the potential to dramatically reduce the number of traffic fatalities. One projection states that, in the fully autonomous future, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/self-driving-cars-could-save-300000-lives-per-decade-in-america/407956/"target="new"&gt;on-road deaths will be reduced by 90%&lt;/a&gt;. The question is about what should be done in the interim, when self-driving cars share the road with human drivers and the illogical ways they can behave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though many of the self-driving cars that are already in testing seem to be safer than the average human driver, there is still a lot of hesitation about rolling them out &lt;i&gt;en masse&lt;/i&gt;. One hurdle is confronting the amount of negative attention that will be generated when an AV crashes. Hand-wringing about a crash caused by a self-driving car could set back self-driving cars tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negative impact can even be seen in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/09/self-driving-shuttle-in-las-vegas-got-into-an-accident-on-its-first-day.html" target="new"&gt;recent accident&lt;/a&gt; involving an autonomous shuttle in Las Vegas.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shuttle was operating on its first day when a truck driver started backing a vehicle towards the shuttle. The shuttle did what it was supposed to do and stopped, but the truck driver did not notice the shuttle and backed into its bumper. Even though the accident was entirely the fault of the human truck driver, most headlines about the incident focused solely on the autonomous shuttle. One can imagine the negative PR storm for an incident with graver consequences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these issues in mind, the question of when and how lawmakers should allow autonomous vehicles on our roads is a challenging one, and appears to be a sort of balancing act. Introducing imperfect AVs immediately could risk alienating consumers, but waiting until autonomous vehicles are "perfect" would leave the issue of road death rates unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RAND Corporation addressed this scenario in a recent study called "The Enemy of the Good: Estimating the Cost of Waiting for Nearly Perfect Automated Vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the report, authors Nidhi Kalra and David G. Groves compared the costs and benefits of three hypothetical realities: Allowing AVs on the road when they're 10% better than human drivers (Improve10), allowing them on the road when they're 75% better than human drivers (Improve75), and allowing 90% better (Improve90). The results validated those who favor getting them on our streets as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We find that, in the short term, more lives are cumulatively saved under a more permissive policy (Improve10) than stricter policies requiring greater safety advancements (Improve75 or Improve90) in nearly all conditions, and those savings can be significant--hundreds of thousands of lives," Kalra and Groves write in a &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2150.html" target="new"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of their findings. "In the long term, more lives are cumulatively saved under an Improve10 policy than either Improve75 or Improve90 policies under all combinations of conditions we explored. In many cases, those savings can be more than half a million lives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason behind the researchers' findings is the belief that it could be a very long time before self-driving cars are 75% to 90% safer than human drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the leading AV developers appear to have designed operating systems that can process and handle 99% of on-road situations, it's that remaining 1% -- the unexpected, crazy and the abnormal -- that can throw cars for a loop. These happen to be the scenarios that are most likely to lead to accidents, for AVs and humans alike. Many experts consider Level 5 autonomy to be an idea that will only exist theoretically in the near future. So just how close are today's cars to hitting the RAND Corporation's "Improve10" numbers? It varies, but generally speaking they may not be as close as you might believe, according to Aarian Marshall at Wired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The 43 companies testing self-driving cars in California must submit public 'disengagement reports,' noting every time a human driver intervenes while behind the wheel of a self-driving car," Marshall &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-cars-rand-report/" target="new"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. "Last year's reports show these cars are getting better, but aren't all the way there: Waymo's cars averaged 5,128 miles between disengagements -- pretty good! -- while Mercedes-Benz did 1.8 -- not so great. Today, autonomous vehicles are about as good as a standard crappy driver."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, AV designers are the first to acknowledge that their products are far from perfect. But their work is driven by the strong belief that, one day, their work will help save thousands of lives every year. If Kalra and Groves are to be believed, that day ought to come sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Since the invention of the modern automobile, the fundamental parts that make up a car have remained almost entirely the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engines, brakes, fuel systems and the like have certainly evolved and improved over the years, but they are the same essential parts that comprised the Model T. With the introduction of the connected car, however, a new set of parts are emerging as fundamental components of the automobile of tomorrow. While this hardware may be essential for cars already on the road, much of it will become required for newly manufactured vehicles going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For connected cars, the single piece of technology that is most vital to their connective components is the communication chip. Already a significant market, the production of modem chips is set to explode in the coming years. As semiconductor analyst Tristan Gerra told Reuters, in the current automotive landscape, only 12 million of the 90 million cars manufactured annually come equipped with Internet connectivity. That number will soon be a lot bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You basically [will] have 80 million units per year that are going to get a modem," Gerra &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom-intel/qualcomm-buy-may-pit-broadcom-against-intel-in-connected-car-fight-idUSKBN1D81CP" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early November, news emerged that the landscape around this market could dramatically shift, as Broadcom submitted an unsolicited bid to buy another chip maker, Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move by Broadcom CEO Hock Tan to try to purchase Qualcomm for $105 billion would amount to the largest takeover in tech industry history, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/dealbook/broadcom-qualcomm-merger.html" target="new"&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the size of the two companies, a merger would potentially impact an overwhelming majority of the world's smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as important as the takeover news is for smartphones, it could cause even bigger waves in the automotive world. A merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm would instantly create an outsize player in connected car chip manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the deal remains at a standstill as Qualcomm has rejected the offer but Broadcom's management remains determined and bidding their time. (See {doclink 738135}.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm is itself in the midst of acquiring NXP, a Dutch global semiconductor company that makes chips for automotive infotainment and camera systems. Reuters reported that Egil Juliussen, an analyst at IHSMarkit, says that if the three companies became one, it would be a "formidable competitor in the automotive chip space." Juliussen sees "Intel and Nvidia Corp, which make both make the main processors used in self-driving vehicles, as leaders in the young market, but a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm-NXP would be a strong third-place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm's $38 billion deal for NXP was approved with conditions by the US Justice Department, but the &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nxp-semicondtrs-m-a-qualcomm-eu/qualcomm-nxp-ruling-may-be-in-2018-eu-competition-commissioner-idUSKBN1DF1K2"target="new"&gt;European Commission has voiced concerns&lt;/a&gt; and delayed a decision until December. If Qualcomm successfully acquires NXP, and if Broadcom successfully acquires Qualcomm thereafter, the resulting enterprise could be a connected car powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those are significant "ifs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Some experts foresee Broadcom needing to launch a hostile takeover to successfully acquire Qualcomm, meaning it would need to appeal to shareholders directly to replace the company's board before accepting the offer. Regardless of what happens next, Broadcom has surely put competing connected car chip manufacturers on notice.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Projects that promote the development of autonomous vehicles are natural candidates for public-private partnerships, because AV advancement figures to greatly benefit both sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touted as the future of transportation, self-driving cars could someday represent the vast majority of the automotive market, and they open up the automotive category to new types of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the general public, driverless vehicles could improve quality of life in several different ways. AV technology may someday greatly reduce on-road deaths and injuries, eliminate the expenses and hassle of private vehicle ownership and offer newfound mobility to disabled or elderly people who are unable to drive themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most common type of autonomous vehicle project on which public and private entities collaborate are testing grounds, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.acmwillowrun.org/" target="new"&gt;American Center for Mobility&lt;/a&gt; (ACM) in Ypsilanti, Township, Mich. The 500-acre site, situated on a former bomber plant, offers miles of roads for testing self-driving cars. It exists thanks to investment from both the State of Michigan and various private investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACM gained another investor in January when &lt;a href="https://www.subaru.com/" target="new"&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt; announced it would contribute $2 million to the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Kaminga Shirakawa, vice president of Subaru Research and Development, the involvement at the American Center for Mobility is not only an opportunity for the Japanese automaker to test its autonomous vehicle technology, but also to further entrench itself in the American market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. market has long been a very important part of the success of Subaru, and as so, it is a major goal of ours to create a product that will be appealing to the U.S. customer," &lt;a href="http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180116/news/650216/subaru-invests-2-million-in-american-center-for-mobility" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Shirakawa. "We are looking forward to working with ACM in the future development of the facility and using this impressive resource to provide the highest quality products possible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACM has already secured $110 million of its targeted fundraising goal of $135 million. The state of Michigan has contributed $35 million has waived the center's property taxes --
 which would amount to about $1.9 million annually -- for the first 15 years. The rest of ACM's funding comes from private investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automakers involved in the project include Toyota, Ford and Hyundai. Other companies, like AT&amp;T and Visteon, have also invested, largely so they can test futuristic connected car technology on the ACM's tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limited opportunities to test driverless cars on public roads, especially in the early stages of development, developers rely heavily on closed courses like the one at the American Center for Mobility. The ACM features a 2.5-mile highway loop, a 700-foot curved tunnel, two double overpasses and various types of intersections and roundabouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its location is also notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ACM's &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739190" target="new"&gt;first day&lt;/a&gt; of operation on December 11, engineers from Visteon found themselves testing in a full-on snow storm. This was far from reason to pack up and go home. Inclement weather offers a significant challenge to AV sensors of all types, and testing in a blizzard allows developers to perfect how their systems deal with these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As Waymo plans to expand its self-driving, ride-sharing services across the US, the company has now ordered "thousands" of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to expand its ever-growing autonomous vehicle fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fcanorthamerica.com/Pages/Home.aspx"target="new"&gt;Chrysler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/"target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; have a relationship dating to 2016, when the two companies agreed to a deal for a fleet of 100 minivans. That agreement later expanded to 500 vehicles in 2017, and on January 30, the two &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fca-us-llc-set-to-deliver-thousands-of-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-minivans-to-waymos-self-driving-service-300589929.html"target="new"&gt;expanded the relationship&lt;/a&gt; to involve more of these hybrid vehicles, although both declined to release a specific number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacifica minivans are due to arrive later this year, when Waymo expands its autonomous ride-sharing service. The first stop is Phoenix, where the company, along with many others, is testing autonomous and self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, Waymo, which is an Alphabet company, will move across the US, including Atlanta, San Francisco, Metro Detroit and Kirkland, Wash.&lt;/p&gt;

{videoembed|738878}

&lt;p&gt;When this expansion happens, Waymo expects the vehicles to operate at Level 4 autonomy, meaning that no driver is needed as part of the service. These vehicles were jointly developed by engineers from Waymo and FCA, the parent company of Chrysler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement, both companies note that these types of minivans offer the ideal combination of electrical, powertrain, chassis and other systems structures to support Waymo's combination of hardware and software that helps create self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the world's first fleet of fully self-driving vehicles on the road, we've moved from research and development, to operations and deployment," Waymo CEO John Krafcik wrote in Tuesday's announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo is not the only company to attempt a self-driving, ride-sharing service, but the company now seems further ahead compared to some of its competition. For instance, General Motors' self-driving subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738822"target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; is developing a similar service for what the company calls "dense urban environments" that will be available sometime in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber, which helped pioneered the ride-sharing market, has been testing self-driving vehicles in the Pittsburgh area, and taking advantage of that city's engineering talent. The company also &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738515"target="new"&gt;recently cut a deal&lt;/a&gt; with Volvo.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The celebrated court battle between autonomous driving hopefuls Waymo and Uber will finally begin on Monday, February 5. After nearly a year of accusations and revelations, a federal jury will hear the opening arguments in a case that could reshape the self-driving car industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, under US District Court Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, is expected to last three weeks and might see Uber founder Travis Kalanick, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and other well known Silicon Valley names take the stand. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Waymo's stark &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7dzPLynxaXuQjY3dkllZ2ZKb0k/view" target="new"&gt;allegations&lt;/a&gt;, an apparent criminal probe, and the shake-up that has since rocked Uber, have brought rapt attention to the case. But what's fueling the fight is the global competition to corner what may become a &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/passenger-economy-report-infographic.html"target="new"&gt;$7 trillion industry&lt;/a&gt; by 2050. The suit could knock Uber back in a race that has drawn in the world's biggest automakers and tech companies as well as countless startups. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the case is the idea that Waymo developed important technologies first and Uber -- which didn't launch its self-driving project until 2015 -- stole its work to catch up. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Waymo, formerly Google's self-driving car project and now a division of Alphabet, is testing autonomous Chrysler Pacific minivans in at least three cities and plans to commercially launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Phoenix this year. In the past week, the company announced it would order thousands more of the vans. &lt;a href="https://www.navigantresearch.com/research/navigant-research-leaderboard-automated-driving-vehicles" target="new"&gt;Navigant Research&lt;/a&gt; recently ranked Waymo among the top companies in the business, just behind General Motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber began offering test rides in self-driving cars in Pittsburgh last year and has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740108&amp;" target="new"&gt;soon be able to operate cars without safety drivers&lt;/a&gt;. But the Navigant report ranked it as an industry challenger, two rungs below Waymo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google jumped on autonomous driving earlier than many, launching its self-driving car project in 2009. Former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski worked there, then left to form the autonomous truck startup Otto in 2016. Waymo alleges that before he left, Levandowski used special software on his laptop to get into Waymo's design server and download more than 14,000 confidential files about the company's Lidar designs. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Other Waymo engineers who later worked for Levandowski at Otto also stole secrets, the suit charges. Waymo alleges that when Uber acquired Otto later that year, partly for its Lidar system, what it really got was technology stolen from Waymo. Lidar, which uses lasers to sense cars, people, and objects around a vehicle, is a critical component in most autonomous vehicles and the focus of a race to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=739548" target="new"&gt;boost resolution&lt;/a&gt; and cut size and cost. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Waymo says it discovered Uber was using its Lidar designs when it was accidentally copied in on an e-mail from one of Uber's Lidar component providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Otto and Uber have taken Waymo's intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology," the complaint said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber promptly &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-shoots-down-googles-claims-of-stolen-self-driving-tech-2017-2" target="new"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; the charges and called the suit "a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After filing the suit on February 23, 2017, Waymo asked Judge Alsup to halt Uber's self-driving initiative until the case could be decided. In May, the judge declined to shut down the project but ordered Levandowski not to work on any Lidar-related projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year, a letter to Alsup &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/doj-confirms-new-criminal-probe-linked-to-waymo-v-uber-lawsuit/" target="new"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that federal prosecutors were conducting a criminal investigation related to Uber's acquisition of Otto. It said they were looking into the possibility that Kalanick and Levandowski used "non-attributable electronic devices" to communicate outside of Uber's official systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparations for the trial have played out against the backdrop of a shake-up at Uber that forced Kalanick out as CEO and altered the company's board. Among the triggers were controversy over allegations of sexual harassment and underhanded surveillance practices at the company. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There's a distinct feeling of frustration that comes with buying a shiny new consumer electronic device only to discover that within a few short months, a shinier, newer version of the device has been released with new features that make your gadget feel antiquated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a reason that iPhones have a weak sales history in the month of August. Users know that an updated one is going to be released in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, auto enthusiasts have the same luxury. If they want to have the latest model of a given car for the longest period of time possible, they know they can get 12 guaranteed months of up-to-dateness if they buy a new model when it's first released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the luxuries that go along with being a Tesla owner, this type of annual consistency is not one of them. Tesla does away with the traditional "model year" product rollout cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla owners wouldn't have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of deliberate innovation that eschews yearly vehicle release cycles is the same ethos that leads the company to consistently deliver revolutionary cars to market. But Tesla does make adjustments to certain models already on the market, which can result in a Model X sold one week being different than one sold two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue came to something of a head recently, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2017/08/09/tesla-autopilot-2-5-hardware-computer-autonomous-driving/" target="new"&gt;when Electrek reported&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla has begun to equip its cars with computer hardware known as Autopilot 2.5 hardware (or HW 2.5), an upgrade from HW 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief history of Tesla's autopilot hardware is this: Beginning in September 2014, Tesla began outfitting its vehicles with HW 1.0 to enable limited autonomous functionality. HW 1.0 featured a windshield-mounted camera, a front-facing radar and several ultrasonic sensors. In October 2016, Tesla began to equip all its vehicles with HW 2.0, which featured eight cameras and various other significant upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company boldly proclaimed that the Autopilot 2.0 hardware possessed everything a car would need to operate fully autonomously, and that those features would be forthcoming via over-the-air updates once software was up to snuff and the regulatory conditions were right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Before activating the features enabled by the new hardware, we will further calibrate the system using millions of miles of real-world driving to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience," reads &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware%20" target="new"&gt;a post from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the recently discovered HW 2.5. If HW 2.0 is truly capable of delivering a self-driving experience, why would 2.5 even be necessary -- and what does it have that 2.0 doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The internal name HW 2.5 is an overstatement, and instead it should be called something more like HW 2.1," a Tesla spokesperson wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16119746/tesla-self-driving-hardware-upgrade-hw-2-5" target="new"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "This hardware set has some added computing and wiring redundancy, which very slightly improves reliability... However, we still expect to achieve full self-driving capability with safety more than twice as good as the average human driver without making any hardware changes to HW 2.0. If this does not turn out to be the case, which we think is highly unlikely, we will upgrade customers to the 2.5 computer at no cost."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement doesn't answer a whole lot, although Tesla owners should feel slightly at ease knowing that they'll receive an upgrade if necessary. It may be awhile before we get an answer to that "if," and until then it appears we won't be getting an in-depth "why."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Every two years, the Olympics represent a chance for countries to shine on a global stage. For most nations, those exploits take place on the fields, pools, tracks and mountains where the athletic competition takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for the country that hosts the Games, there are many other unique opportunities to showcase the best that it has to offer, from cultural displays in the Opening Ceremony to the architecture of the different venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will certainly be the case when Pyongyang, South Korea hosts the 2018 Winter Olympics in February. South Korea will most certainly pull out all the stops to brand itself as a global leader in various ways. One of those will be autonomous vehicle technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korean automaker &lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt; announced it will use the Olympics as an opportunity to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/hyundai-to-use-hd-maps-to-field-self-driving-cars-at-2018-winter-olympics/?ncid=mobilerecirc_recent" target="new"&gt;showcase its self-driving technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyundai says that, at the Olympics, it will reveal a Level 4 autonomous vehicle, meaning it's a self-driving car that can operate itself in almost all situations. (Level 5 autonomy, or full autonomy that requires zero human intervention, is merely theoretical at this point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Olympics only a few months away, though, Hyundai is already pushing forward some of the tech that it figures to demo in February. It recently bumped up the timeline of its self-driving car technology in &lt;a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2017/07/21/hyundais-semi-autonomous-highway-driving-assist-2-features-hit-market-soon/" target="new"&gt;introducing its Highway Driving Assist 2 (HDA2) system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparable to Tesla's Autopilot systems, Hyundai's HDA2 is rated by most as performing Level 2 autonomy. This means, essentially, that it can perform highway driving with little intervention from a human driver. The tech nears Level 3 autonomy when on freeways. If Hyundai does indeed have Level 4 tech to demonstrate soon, then it must consider its lesser technologies to be quite far along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Winter Olympics, though, comes the possibility of inclement weather, and snow and other winter conditions have been known to be a major obstacle for self-driving cars to overcome. Apparently, though, Hyundai's engineers are hoping for the best wintry mix they can get, as they believe their cars will impress with their performance in poor weather. Like most autonomous vehicles, Hyundai's cars use Lidar and radar, but they also use HD mapping technology to get a more comprehensive understanding of their immediate environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At shows and conventions, car enthusiasts are able to see an endless number of demonstrations that automakers put on to showcase their vehicles' autonomous capabilities. For people with little interest in cars, though, there's a strong chance they've never seen an autonomous vehicle in action, in person or otherwise. If Hyundai can effectively leverage the mass exposure brought about by an Olympic Games, they could be the first company to demonstrate self-driving technology to a whole new audience.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If you come upon a wildly ambitious tech idea that seems decades away from being a realistic possibility, there's a good chance that it came from Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink or one of the other innovative companies that Elon Musk is involved in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, SpaceX announced that it had plans to send a spaceship to Mars by 2018 with the intention of learning how to best land humans there someday in the future. Musk has also spoken extensively of the idea of a Hyperloop -- a train that would pilot routes like Los Angeles to San Francisco or New York City to Washington, D.C. in minutes instead of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of all the attention that the moonshot projects garner, some of Musk's other ideas can seem quaint by comparison. But these other ideas, however, have the benefit of being much more feasible in the near term. Take the recent news that &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; is developing electric, self-driving semi trucks. The company, with one fell swoop, becomes a top-level player in autonomous fleet, a sector which figures to start paying dividends soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-truck-autonomous-idUSKBN1AP2GD" target="new"&gt;Reuters recently obtained&lt;/a&gt; a document showing correspondence between Tesla and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles discussing road tests for a prototype long-haul autonomous vehicle truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla, which has produced multiple models of electric vehicles for consumers, first announced plans to develop electric trucks in 2016. At the time, Musk spoke strongly about the moral imperative of developing electric vehicles that would greatly reduce greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We can imagine far into the future and life is still good -- that's what 'sustainable' means," &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/21/elon-musk-sets-sights-on-buses-and-trucks-as-he-says-electric-ve/" target="new"&gt;Musk said, according to the UK Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;. "At some point we must achieve a sustainable energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse." He did not, however, mention anything about autonomous functionality at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plenty of companies in the AV space have already put years of development into self-driving freight trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most notable is &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/truck/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, which became the perceived leader in this market after&lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2016/8/18/12540068/uber-paid-680-million-for-self-driving-truck-company-otto-for-the-tech-not-the-trucks" target="new"&gt; acquiring Otto for $680 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. But there are plenty of other players, although each company does things a bit differently. Einride has &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734426" target="new"&gt;done away with a driver's seat&lt;/a&gt; entirely. Embark wants its trucks to drive solo on highways and then &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734748" target="new"&gt;pick up human drivers&lt;/a&gt; for urban navigation, and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734648" target="new"&gt;Transfix is looking to generate high-level analytics&lt;/a&gt; to help legacy trucking companies make a smooth transition to autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, Tesla has its own spin on things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company hasn't gone to the Einride extreme of eliminating cabins altogether, but it does reportedly plan to test its semis without drivers -- something that would require an exceptional form of special permission from Nevada or any other state in which they wanted to operate. Tesla also appears to want several of its trucks to travel closely together at the same time, a method known as platooning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst noted that it's a savvy way of saving costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Platooning has the potential to significantly reduce the running costs for truck operators and is an easier bridge to a practical, commercial semi-autonomous application in the early 2020s," &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/08/10/tesla-semi-truck/555266001/" target="_blank"&gt;he told USA Today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla is yet to comment on the Reuters report, but the leaked news may accelerate the company's timeframe for publicly introducing the technology. When they finally do so, we -- and the rest of the industry -- will get a much clearer picture of what they're up to.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Apple fans have plenty to be excited about right now. The iPhone 8 will be released in the fall, marking the ten-year anniversary of the release of the original iPhone in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those hoping for an "iCar," however, the news is not as good. While Apple is still working on autonomous vehicle technology, the company reportedly abandoned plans to manufacture its own self-driving car some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/technology/apple-self-driving-car.html" target="new"&gt;New York Times report&lt;/a&gt; by Daisuke Wakabayashi, who spoke with five people near Apple's work on cars, provides insight into how the company pivoted from working on an autonomous Apple automobile to merely focusing on tech that would work in cars built by different companies. The news should not come as a complete surprise as the tone of Apple's trademark caginess on its project has turned from sly to deflective in recent months, at least with regards to cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"One purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars. There are others," Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735185" target="new"&gt;said in June&lt;/a&gt;. "We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects, actually, to work on. And so autonomy is something that's incredibly exciting for us, but we'll see where it takes us. We're not really saying from a product point of view, but we are being straightforward in saying that it's a core technology that we see as important."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple's abandonment of a proprietary vehicle isn't for lack of ambition. The folks at Apple tend to shoot for the moon, and that was the case with self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a division code-named "Titan," high-level Apple designers, engineers and executives strategized on how to disrupt automobiles. They worked with conventional AV ideas like &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;Lidar&lt;/a&gt; and designs that did away with steering wheels and pedals altogether. But they also reportedly toyed with some incredibly futuristic-sounding plans such as the development of a spherical steering wheel and augmented reality imposed on windshields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, though, Apple struggled with some of the same issues common to all AV developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous technology is still very much an emerging one, and uncertainty about the direction of the industry seemed to prohibit Apple from going all-in on any one creative vision. There was much division, for example, over whether or not to design a fully autonomous car or a semiautonomous one, a question that Google struggled with for years before ultimately deciding on the former. For building an operating system, some wanted to use the conventional C++ while others wanted to use Apple's signature Swift programming language. There are parallels here to Tesla, which diverges from industry norms in several key ways, including its three-dimensional mapping systems and the way it sends over-the-air updates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Apple isn't getting out of the autonomous vehicle game altogether. The company will still have its hands in various AV projects. One of the few that we know about for sure is a self-driving shuttle that will shepherd employees around the company's campus. They're not the first to attempt this type of project. Starting this fall, EasyMile &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734191" target="new"&gt;will pilot an autonomous shuttle&lt;/a&gt; in a California business park, and Navya will have an &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734742" target="new"&gt;active AV shuttle&lt;/a&gt; on the University of Michigan's campus. But just because it's an Apple product, this shuttle will likely get more attention. And also leave observers wondering what could've been if Apple had built its own car.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Legacy automakers were not the first entrants in the race to develop self-driving cars. That gave tech companies and startups a head start in developing the autonomous vehicle technology that has the potential to disrupt society in major ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger car companies could afford to wait it out, watch how the self-driving car space develops and then jump in when the time is right.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's exactly what they have done, taking advantage of their vast resources to strike partnerships with smaller companies that have been in the AV game from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing large OEMs have done that is similar to their startup brethren is remain vague about exactly what their plans are. Since no one knows exactly where things are going, everyone wants to avoid making promises they can't keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, a recent Medium post by Sherif Marakby, Ford's vice president of Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification, was especially notable because it laid out specific plans for Ford's approach to AVs in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Titled "&lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/building-a-business-enabled-by-self-driving-technology-875ca374ab8a" target="new"&gt;Building a Business Enabled by Self-Driving Technology&lt;/a&gt;," Marakby immediately makes it clear that AVs will be at the center of Ford's strategy in the coming years, with an emphasis on ride-sharing and ride-hailing programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're developing self-driving technology because the world is changing rapidly. For many people who live in large cities, owning a car is no longer a viable choice," writes Marakby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ride sharing and hailing is on the rise, and shopping at malls is giving way to buying online, which is increasing package delivery services," Marakby added. "Therefore, we're building a business to capitalize on both of these trends. We plan to develop and manufacture self-driving vehicles at scale, deployed in cooperation with multiple partners, and with a customer experience based on human-centered design principles."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move towards the more communal ride-sharing and ride-hailing as opposed to private ownership of autonomous vehicles is part of a larger trend that, as Marakby notes, is set to be of special interest in urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZipCar executive Jonathan Hampson recently suggested that self-driving cars &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734651" target="new"&gt;should not to be privately owned&lt;/a&gt; in large cities. Platforms such as &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735132" target="new"&gt;Harman's Car-as-a-Service Solution&lt;/a&gt; empower manufacturers, dealers and others to manage fleets and offer these types of services more easily than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Marakby and Ford, it's clear that a prioritization of ride-sharing and a prioritization of electric vehicles go hand-in-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since the success of autonomous ride hailing or sharing and package delivery will be judged by the number of miles driven that generate revenue, or those carrying people and packages, we're focused on utilization time and the amount of time a vehicle can remain on the road," Marakby writes. "That's why the fuel efficiency and total range of a hybrid-electric vehicle makes the most sense initially."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative to how other major automakers talk about their approach to self-driving cars -- most lack specifics -- Ford's direct talk on their plan comes across as bold. More importantly, it allows Ford to stake its claim on vehicles and services that it has the power to deliver on sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It can be a disconcerting moment when you get off a plane or drive across an international border and realize that your cellphone has stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even worse is getting back from a vacation to find a bill charging you hundreds of dollars for roaming fees that you didn't even know you were racking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans have become so reliant upon cellphones that they are like extensions of our bodies, and the tools they provide are especially helpful in unfamiliar territory.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p The same could be said of connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigation services are indispensable in a foreign country. Most drivers would be literally lost without them. So imagine crossing the Canadian border, and your car's navigation services shut down because your service provider doesn't extend to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a distressing thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it's an issue already being tackled as more and more drivers find themselves behind the wheels of connected cars. One major player in this area is Dublin startup &lt;a href="http://cubictelecom.com/" target="new"&gt;Cubic Telecom&lt;/a&gt;. The company received a huge boost recently by raising $46.5 million in financing as part of its Series C round. Investors included &lt;a href="http://www.audi-electronics-venture.de/aev/de.html" target="new"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/" target="new"&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as firms like Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and Valid Soluciones Tecnologicas SAU.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cubic Telecom is now valued at $215 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cubic was founded in 2007 to help solve the aforementioned scenario in which travelers struggled to find adequate cellphone services when abroad. While the company was a pioneer in that market, the types of services it offered were eventually adopted by major cell carriers.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Cubic pivoted, and it now provides the same type of international solutions for Internet of Things devices, chief among them connected cars, as it once did for cellphones. Cubic CEO Barry Napier says its tech is now in nearly a million cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our connected intelligence platform has been growing between 23 percent to 25 percent every 55 days this year," Napier &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/cubic-telecom-gets-46-5m-to-connect-cars-and-other-devices-globally/" target="new"&gt;told TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "Our software has updated over 500,000 cars this year via OTA (Over the Air) and we will hit over 1 million cars this year."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audi's investment in Cubic follows a pre-existing partnership between the companies that dates back some time.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, Audi and Cubic launched an international in-car service that allow users to "check email on a laptop, use a favorite music service or stream a movie to a tablet." As a luxury automobile brand, Audi makes perfect sense as an early partner for Cubic's game-changing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Audi and Cubic Telecom are strong development partners of connected infotainment solutions and intend to connect the models of the Audi brand even better with its environment and the internet in the future," Peter Steiner, head of Audi Electronics Venture, wrote &lt;a href="https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/audi-and-cubic-telecom-start-strategic-partnership-2303" target="new"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like cellphone service providers eventually adapted and caught up to Cubic last decade, OEMs figure to try and compete with their own similar IoT services in the coming years, especially for cars. But by forging a powerful partnership with Audi, Cubic has now established a firm footing in its current niche and will be tough to uproot.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Within the last decade, app-based ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft have fundamentally changed the way that people think about mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ride-hailing has eclipsed taxis in cities where cabs once reigned supreme at an incredibly fast pace, especially considering how entrenched those pre-existing systems were. In less urban areas, the effects of these services have been even more significant. Those who were once relatively stranded are now able to easily obtain rides for affordable prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As profound an impact as these ride-hailing services have had, another, bigger transportation revolution is coming. A new report from consulting giant McKinsey details the way that self-driving taxis or "robo-taxis" will transform the way people think about mobility entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The success of robo-taxis will likely change car-ownership and public-transportation dynamics at a fundamental level," according to &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/gauging-the-disruptive-power-of-robo-taxis-in-autonomous-driving?cid=other-soc-twi-mip-mck-oth-1710&amp;amp;kui=J4-PZ4EnXEL4L3r-YY-uxA" target="new"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. "By offering lower mobility costs, greater convenience (for example, providing door-to-door service without disruptions), and increased productivity as they free occupants from driving, robo-taxis will change how people think about mobility in urban environments."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report began as an attempt to explore a use case within the autonomous vehicle ecosystem, and the authors recognized the viability of robo-taxis by asking four key questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is being transported? (passengers or goods)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who owns the vehicle (private or fleet ownership)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where can the vehicle operate (highway or urban &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; highway)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What technology is being used (driving assistance, partial autonomy or full autonomy)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a field of possible use cases that included long-haul trucking and last-mile delivery sources, the authors felt that robo-taxis represented the most promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most interestingly, the report explores a scenario where the automotive industry could find it more profitable while, at the same time, consumers pay far less for transportation services. On the industry end of things, McKinsey projects that owning their own fleets and offering robo-taxi services will allow companies to better capitalize on a per-vehicle basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By treating mobility as a service instead of a one-off transaction, automotive players could open new revenue pools worth billions, and in the process disrupt both the automotive and mobility business models," the report finds. "For example, a car company might earn only $2,500 on average for each car sold; spread over a 150,000-mile vehicle lifespan, that works out to about a penny a mile. The mobility-as-a-service model throws that penny-pinching approach out in favor of a more lucrative profit-per-trip focus."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things sound similarly rosy for consumers in the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The economics could convince people in large cities to switch entirely to shared mobility," the report says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now, robo-taxis have been seen as a single aspect of an autonomous vehicle future. But as the McKinsey report lays out, robo-taxis could represent &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; future.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;LeBron James is the best basketball player in the game right now. He ranks ninth on the all-time scoring list, has won three NBA championships, and many believe James could retire as the best of &lt;em&gt;all time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James is also an incredibly savvy businessman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike that is rumored to be worth $1 billion. James's endorsements also include Samsung, Beats by Dre, and Sprite. He's has also proven to be a shrewd investor. He invested $1 million in startup restaurant chain Blaze Pizza in 2012, and his share has already increased in value to between $35 and $40 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As his investment in the Blaze Pizza shows, James is always on the lookout for the next big thing. And in a marketing campaign for &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/autonomous-vehicles.html" target="new"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; that launched on October 9, LeBron puts his considerable marketing muscle behind one of the more forward-thinking technologies in the world today: self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Some people are fearless," &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VzoqU5IQT4" target="new"&gt;voices a narrator&lt;/a&gt; over footage of James wowing crowds. "No pressure too great, no stage too big -- not afraid of anything." The commercial then cuts to LeBron skeptically eyeing a self-driving car, before entering reluctantly at the nudging of his friends. "Intel is helping power autonomous cars you can trust, so we can all be fearless," the narrator says as James rides around before giddily exclaiming, "I'm keeping this!" at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VzoqU5IQT4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bold choice for Intel to address the concept of "fear" surrounding self-driving cars in such a direct manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even LeBron, shown to be fearless in the ad's opening moments, has some concern about having a vehicle drive him around by itself. That concern makes him relatable to a viewer, and James's change in attitude after riding around in an autonomous vehicle is something that could occur for any first-time AV passenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing the campaign, Intel's vice president and general manager of automated driving, Kathy Winter, was forthright in expressing how she believes consumers should feel about AV safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Society's fear of driverless cars is somewhat baffling to me," Winter told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446890/lebron-james-self-driving-car-commercial-intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;. "Given that car crashes attributable to human error cause more than 1 million vehicle deaths every year, it's those human-driven cars people should be afraid of. Yet all of us today get behind the wheel and simply trust that the cars coming toward them in the opposite lane will stay where they're supposed to. From my point of view, unless those are self-driving cars, we should all be terrified."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's significant that a non-automaker would launch a high-profile ad campaign about self-driving cars, but it comes on the heels of other Intel news that forecasts where the company's autonomous vehicle ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735423" target="new"&gt;recently purchased&lt;/a&gt; Israeli AV sensor company &lt;a href="http://www.mobileye.com/" target="new"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt; for an enormous $15 billion sum, and announced &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/waymo-intel-announce-collaboration-driverless-car-technology/" target="new"&gt;a collaboration with Waymo&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As the self-driving sector evolves and matures, there are a wide variety of niche industries that companies can find success in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto parts that didn't exist before connected cars and autonomous vehicles came around -- sensors, HD cameras and AV-specific processors to name a few -- will all be integral elements of the self-driving future. Companies can, of course, choose to go it alone and build a driverless vehicle from the ground up internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the development of an autonomous platform that can be used across different makes and models may be an even grander goal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To design an interconnected platform for autonomous vehicles is an enormous task and, accordingly, huge companies have been coming together to share resources in order to create one. Perhaps the most prominent collaboration is headlined by &lt;a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html" target="new"&gt;BMW Group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/autonomous-vehicles.html" target="new"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;, and it just grew larger with the addition of Canadian automotive supplier &lt;a href="http://www.magna.com/" target="new"&gt;Magna International&lt;/a&gt;. On October 11, it was announced that Magna would join the partnership as a "Tier 1 technology integrator," meaning it will help customize and install the platform's systems into automobiles designed by different OEMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Many of the autonomy challenges the industry is facing can't be handled in isolation," Magna CTO Swamy Kotagiri wrote in a &lt;a href="http://www.magna.com/media/press-releases-news/releases-news/2017/10/10/press-release---magna-joins-the-bmw-group--intel-and-mobileye-platform-as-an-integrator-to-bring-autonomous-driving-technology-to-the-market" target="new"&gt; statement&lt;/a&gt;. "I am confident that the many strengths brought forward by each partner will contribute to the delivery of a self-driving platform the market can leverage. We are extremely excited to be one of the early integrators bringing our unique capabilities to the platform."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klaus Frhlich, a board member of BMW Group, said on behalf of the partnership: "We are very pleased to welcome Magna as the next major industry player to support our non-exclusive platform. This underlines the success story we have been writing over the past year with our unique cooperation and it gives us additional boost in creating a leading ecosystem for the industry of autonomous driving."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important member of the consortium is Israeli sensor company &lt;a href="http://www.mobileye.com/en-us/" target="new"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt;, which is now formally part of Intel after the software giant acquired it for $15 billion this past summer. Mobileye specializes in designing hardware and software systems for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), with collision-avoidance features such as pedestrian and cyclist detection, and forward collision warnings. This baseline technology has helped the company become a leader in the AV space in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other members of the self-driving partnership include &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/" target="new"&gt;Delphi Automotive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/Pages/home.aspx" target="new"&gt;Fiat-Chrysler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its formation, the stated goal of this group has been to have its self-driving platform working on the road by the year 2021. With each subsequent partner that gets on board, the coalition takes a step closer to making that a reality.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of metrics that analysts can use to track the health of the self-driving car market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status of regulatory initiatives on the local, state and national level is one. If more governing bodies are creating a welcoming environment for autonomous vehicle testing, it is a good sign that things are progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer polls are another helpful indicator of how the public attitude is shifting toward  the idea of riding in self-driving cars. There is also the share price of public companies in the AV sector, which reflect investor confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more direct measure of the state of the autonomous vehicle industry, however, is to look at how many self-driving cars are being manufactured. This can be a hard number to pin down, but inferences can be made based on tangential information. Based on recent news from Lidar manufacturer &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt;, there's good reason to believe that AV production has exploded in recent months. On October 10, the company announced that it has more than quadrupled production of its Lidar sensors and doubled its number of full-time employees over the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Velodyne leads the market in real-time 3D Lidar systems for fully autonomous vehicles," Velodyne founder and CEO David Hall noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171010005613/en/Velodyne-LiDAR-Quadruples-Production-Autonomous-Vehicle-Surge/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-bV7DTIYheT0D-1vT4_bKFzt_EW40VMdK6eG-WLfRGUE1fJraLPL1g6AeUGJlCTYs7Oafol48Kkc8KJgZoTHgMu0w8LYSbRdYOj2VdwnuKwa"target=new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "With the tremendous surge in autonomous vehicle orders and new installations across the last 12 months, we scaled capacity to meet this demand, including a significant increase in production from our 200,000 square-foot Megafactory."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called "Megafactory" is Velodyne's newest facility, located in San Jose. The company has two other California locations, as well: A manufacturing facility in Morgan Hill and a research center in Alameda. The company's new employees are spread across all three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars are generally equipped with various forms of sensors, and Lidar is one of the most prominent sensor types. Every second, Lidar sensors send out millions of laser pulses, which bounce off of surrounding objects. By measuring how long it takes these pulses to return to the sensor, Lidar systems determine the distance between a car and other objects in its surrounding environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Lidar has also been blamed for &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;holding back&lt;/a&gt; the production of self-driving cars. It's one of the most expensive components of a self-driving car, which hinders large-scale production of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has long believed that Lidar will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be cheap enough for AV production at scale, and Tesla is one of the few driverless car companies that doesn't use Lidar at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also concerns about the technology's performance. In order to be effective at high speeds, Lidar systems need to be able to detect objects that are far away but fast approaching, and varying weather conditions can also impact Lidar's sensing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Velodyne's success, along with other recent news, suggests that the AV world still has confidence in Lidar. &lt;a href="http://www.gm.com" target="new"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gm-cruise-strobe-lidar/" target="new"&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; Lidar startup &lt;a href="https://www.strobeinc.com/" target="new"&gt;Strobe&lt;/a&gt; to bolster its sensor suites, and &lt;a href="http://waymo.com" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; has developed its own Lidar systems in-house. So while industry concerns about Lidar may linger, there are no signs that the AV sector has any plans to move away from it.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When people in the self-driving car industry take a break from speculating about how autonomous vehicles will transform mobility, their focus tends to go toward other industries that could similarly be disrupted with the rollout of driverless cars and the artificial intelligence technology that powers them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment is one sector that clearly stands to benefit, as eliminating a driver's need to keep eyes on the road opens up new possibilities for in-vehicle media streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their own way, Driverless cars are part of a vanguard of new technologies that could significantly alter the way we live in much the same way the Internet changed our lives when it was first introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new report from the MIT Center for Real Estate looks at another sector that could be impacted by the proliferation of self-driving cars: construction and urban planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Autonomous vehicles could accelerate sprawl by increasing the distances people are willing to travel," authors Albert Saiz and Arianna Salazar write in "&lt;a href="https://www.capitalone.com/commercial/decomm/media/doc/commercial/capital-one-real-trends-real-estate.pdf" target="new"&gt;Real Trends&lt;/a&gt;: The Future of Real Estate in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This acceleration in sprawl is the natural next step for areas that rely on private car usage and are underserved by public transportation," the two add. "Without policies that encourage ridesharing of autonomous vehicles, reductions in travel time and cost will likely increase the number of single-occupant vehicle trips and their distances in sprawling metropolises. We thus forecast that AV adoption will have two impacts: it will facilitate densification in metros that have strong urban cores, but it will aid in the expansion of decentralized 'edge cities.'"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with policies that encourage AV ridesharing, it's easy to imagine how the normalization of driverless cars would encourage people to move farther away from their workplaces. The prospect of a rush hour commute that is actually pleasurable because traffic is reduced and individuals are freed up to do new things could make drive-time road rage a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report, which was underwritten by Capital One Commercial Banking, also predicts a transformation in urban transportation, brought on by autonomous vehicle usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"One of the most commonly-held theories predicts that self-driving cars will reinforce demand for central-city living," write Salazar and Saiz. "In this scenario, fewer driverless cars -- some with several concurrent occupants who use ride-sharing apps -- will indefatigably pick up, and drop off passengers. Demand for parking ought to decrease. Moreover, on-street parking should be replaced with bike lanes and wider sidewalks, while residential programmatic uses should replace garages."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the self-driving car section represents only a small section of MIT's report, the fact that it is mentioned at all is significant. It's becoming clear that no picture of the future is complete without a representation of how our world will be affected by autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; </page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As the 21st-century automotive landscape takes shape, rental car companies find themselves at an inflection point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These companies' original business models have become antiquated. With ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, there is less of a need for travelers to rent a car at the airport. It's far easier to take an Uber everywhere than it is to stand in line at a rental counter, find a place to park in an unfamiliar city, and deal with filling up the tank before a return flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the enormous fleets owned by car rental companies continue to be a substantial and valuable asset, especially as advancing connected car technologies allow for more efficient fleet management.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those technological innovations could create new business opportunities for traditional rental car companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late November, &lt;a href="https://www.avis.com/en/home" target="new"&gt;Avis&lt;/a&gt; made a move in this direction. The company announced the launch of Avis Mobility Lab, a test operation for a connected fleet that will comprise 20 rental car locations and 5,000 vehicles centered around Kansas City but reaching into Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our Mobility Lab in the greater Kansas City area extends our next-generation mobility initiatives," Avis president and CEO Larry De Shon noted in a &lt;a href="http://ir.avisbudgetgroup.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1050299" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The steps we're taking with connected car and smart technologies will increase customer satisfaction as well as reduce operational costs in the near term, while also preparing us to meet the evolving needs of consumers, entrepreneurs, corporations and governments, like the City of Kansas City, a recognized global leader for its Smart City advancements." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative looks set to yield substantial benefits for both Avis and the Kansas City community. Avis will make its own operations more efficient and cost-effective thanks to real-time vehicle diagnostics and analytics. Among other data, cars will automatically report back fuel levels and maintenance needs, ensuring that vehicles are serviced in a timely manner, which prevents more costly maintenance down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the city, a central infrastructure will be developed that allows Avis's connected cars to report traffic data, effectively serving as the city's real-time eyes and ears on the road. For example, this V2I data can be leveraged to optimize traffic light intervals to suit current traffic patterns. Over the long term, the information can help the city take a more informed approach to its road and transportation projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Kansas City has a fully integrated suite of smart city initiatives in our community that make it a better place for our citizens and visitors. Partnering with Avis Budget Group allows us to make that experience even more efficient and responsive to the needs of 21st-century Kansas Citians and our visitors," Kansas City mayor Sly James wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative is the second major one that showcases Avis's quest to remain a viable business as a new transportation revolution unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Avis &lt;a href="http://ir.avisbudgetgroup.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1031344" target="new"&gt;partnered with Waymo&lt;/a&gt; to provide fleet support and maintenance for the self-driving company's vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;No one expects self-driving cars to be cheap, especially right out of the gate. As is the case with any new tech product, prices will be significantly higher until there is widespread adoption and economies of scale start taking effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first iterations of high-definition flat-panel TVs cost well-into five figures, but now run just a few hundred bucks. A similar trajectory can be expected with autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the societal transformation that is predicted with self-driving cars, considerably more attention is being paid to pinpointing exactly when AVs will become affordable for mainstream consumers. Some have even framed the adoption of driverless cars as a public health issue because of the drop in traffic fatalities that is predicted to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/self-driving-ceo-sees-2018-as-dawn-of-robot-taxis-delivery-cars" target="new"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Bloomberg, the CEO of connected and autonomous car company &lt;a href="http://www.aptiv.com/" target="new"&gt;Aptiv&lt;/a&gt; Kevin Clark spoke about the challenges that stand in the way of making AVs affordable, and when he believed they would be overcome. He speculated that prices for AV hardware components won't be low enough to make driverless cars widely affordable to consumers until the year 2025, but that commercial enterprises will step in in the interim and widely adopt self-driving technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When you look at the commercial market -- areas where you have a driver in a vehicle -- there is financial incentive to use autonomous driving," Clark told Bloomberg. "Those customers are willing to pay a much higher price."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting note about Clark's timeline is that by the time his prognosis of affordable autonomous vehicles comes true, societal norms may have shifted even further away from the idea of private car ownership in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a widespread belief that the future of automobile transportation lies not in traditional personal car ownership, but in widespread usage of ride-sharing and ride-hailing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before autonomous vehicles, consumers were discovering the benefits of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; owning a car and that trend seems unlikely to change as on-demand mobility services improve even further. So creating autonomous vehicles for commercial enterprises such as Uber and Lyft could end up being not just an intermediate step, but the final one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ride-hailing companies could also benefit from lower costs. Clark said he believes that Lidar technology costs will come down significantly in the years to come. Current Lidar sensors can drive the cost of an autonomous vehicle up to $150,000. Clark thinks that once Lidar sensors become solid-state, instead of involving a multitude of moving parts as they do currently, that the price for Lidar units will come down to $5,000 by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as Delphi Automotive, Aptiv was born when Delphi split into two separate publicly traded companies: Aptiv and Delphi Technologies. Aptiv specializes in autonomous and connected driving systems, while Delphi Technologies runs the powertrain operations upon which the company built its foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At a time of unprecedented industry change, the underlying strength of both our operating businesses and strategic partnerships will allow each company to focus even more sharply on its unique opportunities, continue to develop the very best advanced technologies, and help our customers navigate the road ahead," Clark &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736848" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; when the spin-off was first announced in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies seem to be well on their way to achieving those goals. Of course, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; those customers navigate the road in the years to come still remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;You can hardly blame those in the driverless car industry who keep score day-to-day -- or even minute-to-minute -- of which companies are up, and which are down, in the autonomous vehicle market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a near-constant stream of announcements about new innovations and partnerships, it's a tough thing to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of compelling evidence to make a case for different AV companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The California DMV &lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/2/2/14474800/waymo-self-driving-dmv-disengagements" target="new"&gt;released data&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year showing how often different manufacturers' driverless cars required human intervention. Based on that, it was easy to make inferences about which corporations had the the most independent driverless systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; announced that it would become &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/with-waymo-in-the-drivers-seat-fully-self-driving-vehicles-can-transform-the-way-we-get-around-75e9622e829a" target="new"&gt;the first company&lt;/a&gt; to test driverless cars on public roads without human monitors it could be read as a sign that the Google spin-off was the top dog in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you could also make a case for GM's &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have the lead &lt;a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/why-testing-self-driving-cars-in-sf-is-challenging-but-necessary-77dbe8345927" target="new"&gt;in testing&lt;/a&gt; self-driving vehicles in real-world urban conditions thanks to its efforts in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, pole position does not necessarily guarantee a first-place finish at the end of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://take.lyft.com/open-platform/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; Chief Strategy Officer Raj Kapoor offered a reminder of this recently during an appearance at the &lt;a href="https://builttoadapt.io/" target="new"&gt;Built to Adapt&lt;/a&gt; conference in early December. One of the most important points Kapoor made is that there isn't even just one race taking place. The actual number is too high to be pegged. Kapoor cited mapping and insurance and regulation as just some examples of industries in which AV-specific business competitions are unfolding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There's going to be an opportunity for a lot of people in this ecosystem. But we're going to go through a gut-wrenching decade or so where everyone is jostling for a position," Kapoor said, according to &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/lyft-exec-gut-wrenching-decade-autonomous-vehicles-2017-12" target="new"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so much uncertainty, many investors are looking at some of the ancillary businesses as more attractive places to put their money. When people are no longer driving cars themselves, they will be looking for other things to do. This will open possibilities for new revenue streams for various forms of entertainment, food, or work productivity enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's all about the adjacencies," Adam Jones, an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734361" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in July. "If you invest in that, you're less likely to be buying an over-hyped situation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kapoor touched on this fluid nature in his comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The complexity, and the lack of standards, is causing a lot of vertical integrations and partnerships of 'maybe I can use this technology,'" he said at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may be too soon to crown a champion, it is becoming more and more clear who the players are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the industry evolves, it is less likely that some completely unknown entity will enter the fray and move the needle. Kapoor's Lyft can certainly be seen as one of those favorites, thanks in part to the partnerships it has struck with other companies in the industry such as Waymo. But only time will tell how Lyft, and others, fare during the upcoming "gut-wrenching" decade.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In June, ride-hailing company Lyft and the Boston-based autonomous driving startup NuTonomy announced a "strategic R&amp;D partnership" to improve the AV customer experience for our driverless future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At Lyft, we imagine a world where car ownership is optional and cities are designed for people instead of cars," &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; co-founder and CEO Logan Green &lt;a href="http://www.nutonomy.com/press-release/nutonomy-lyft-partnership/" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. "Partnering with &lt;a href="http://www.nutonomy.com/" target="new""&gt;NuTonomy&lt;/a&gt; is an important step towards making this vision a reality. The NuTonomy team is one of the first movers in autonomous vehicle development, and we look forward to working with them to bring their autonomous vehicles to the Lyft network."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half a year later, we're seeing this high-profile partnership &lt;a href="http://www.nutonomy.com/company-news/nutonomy-and-lyft-launch-boston-self-driving-pilot/" target="new"&gt;with more clarity&lt;/a&gt;. Lyft customers in Boston's Seaport neighborhood now have the opportunity to ride in an autonomous, NuTonomy-branded vehicle.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After ordering a ride through the Lyft app in the standard way, select passengers will be matched with with a "self-driving NuTonomy ride" instead of a human driver like Boston Red Sox legend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9ogkPyhsL0" target="new"&gt;David Ortiz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our partnership with Lyft has two goals. First, we want to let members of the public experience driverless vehicles firsthand, so they can better understand the impact this new technology will have on their lives," NuTonomy wrote in a blog post. "Second, based on feedback from pilot participants, NuTonomy's engineers will adapt and improve our system, so that we can deliver an autonomous transportation experience that is extremely safe, efficient, and comfortable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second goal is pretty standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All product designers use customer feedback to improve future products. But by acknowledging the reservations many people have when it comes to autonomous vehicles, Lyft and NuTonomy are taking an honest approach that could pay big dividends. If users feel as though they're being gently guided into the autonomous future by a caring friend, they are more likely to be receptive to that change than they would be if they were forced into a decision by a heavy-handed bureaucrat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NuTonomy was founded in 2013 by members of MIT's Mechanical Engineering department, who specialized in developing driverless car technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company began as a consultancy for other AV developers, but soon pivoted to creating its own self-driving software. NuTonomy has an office &lt;a href="http://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2017/10/25/delphi-purchase-nutonomy" target="new"&gt;in Singapore&lt;/a&gt; where it operates an autonomous vehicle pilot project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NuTonomy also has its own AV passenger pilot program in Boston that started &lt;a href="http://www.nutonomy.com/company-news/driving-the-future-of-mobility-in-boston/" target="new"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; independent of Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, Delphi Automotives (now known as Aptiv) &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737696" target="new"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; the startup for $450 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Lyft, NuTonomy represents just one of its autonomous vehicle partners. Since the future of ride-hailing is widely believed to involve autonomous vehicles, Lyft has been making numerous efforts to compete in the autonomy space with its primary rival Uber. Lyft has partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.drive.ai/" target="new"&gt;Drive.ai&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736202" target="new"&gt;offer AV rides&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco, and also has driverless deals in place with &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736849" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/technology/lyft-waymo-self-driving-cars.html" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When Tesla unveiled its Semi truck, it was an impressive affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO Elon Musk rolled onto the stage in the big rig and emerged from the truck's cockpit amid great pomp and circumstance. Musk then began touting the impressive performance characteristics of the Tesla Semi. The battery for the all-electric freight truck had a range of 500 highway miles at full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Semi could also reach 60 mph with a full load in 20 seconds and could climb a 5% grade at 65 mph. All of these metrics were significant improvements on the current fleet of diesel trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was another number that was also significantly higher: the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days after the trucks were &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738351" target="new"&gt;first unveiled&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla announced &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738627" target="new"&gt;the cost&lt;/a&gt; of the Semi. A base model with a 300-mile range would be $150,000, a 500-mile model would be $180,000, and a "Founders Series" model would be $200,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those prices effectively make the Semi twice as expensive as a standard semi truck. The added cost caused many to wonder how many buyers would come calling for &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;'s truck, which isn't expected to be available until 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to that question is starting to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two large fleet operators, &lt;a href="http://www.pepsi.com/en-us/" target="new"&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.anheuser-busch.com/" target="new"&gt;Anheuser-Busch&lt;/a&gt;, recently revealed that they have pre-ordered Tesla Semis. While Tesla has not made any official announcement about the total number of Semi reservations it has received, it is now believed to be more than 250.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anheuser-Busch news was revealed in a report in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/anheuser-busch-orders-40-tesla-semi-trucks-1512648180" target="new"&gt;the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; on December 7. The American subsidiary of beverage giant Anheuser-Busch InBev said it had reserved 40 of the Semis. Once acquired, whether by purchase or lease, the trucks will slot in alongside the 750 trucks currently in the company's fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At Anheuser-Busch, we are constantly seeking new ways to make our supply chain more sustainable, efficient, and innovative," &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/07/technology/anheuser-busch-tesla/index.html" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; head of logistics strategy James Sembrot. "This investment in Tesla semi-trucks helps us achieve these goals while improving road safety and lowering our environmental impact."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five days later, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/pepsico-tesla-orders/pepsico-makes-biggest-public-pre-order-of-tesla-semis-100-trucks-idUSL1N1OB1YR" target="new"&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/a&gt; that PepsiCo Inc. had made reservations for 100 Semis, the largest publicly revealed order so far. The electric trucks will represent a proportionally smaller slice of Pepsi's fleet than it will for Anheuser-Busch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepsi's fleet is more than ten times larger, with approximately 10,000 trucks. According to a company executive cited in the Reuters story, Pepsi will use the trucks primarily for lighter loads like snack shipments and shorter deliveries of drinks, which are heavier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each company cited environmental concerns as a factor for beginning a transition towards electric trucks: Anheuser-Busch hopes to reduce its carbon emissions by 30% by 2025. Pepsi hopes to cut greenhouse gas emissions in its supply chains by at least 20% by 2030. The Semi's &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/semi/" target="new"&gt;energy consumption&lt;/a&gt; is listed at less than 2 kWh per mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Anheuser-Busch and Pepsi -- and other companies that have already placed Semi orders, which include Wal-Mart, J.B. Hunt and DHL -- are also hoping to save money. Tesla says the fuel savings of a Semi could reach $200,000, suggesting that even the most expensive model would eventually pay for itself. If that turns out to be the case, and the vehicle lives up to its performance standards, plenty more orders should start rolling in.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Self-driving concept vehicles from decades past can be pretty funny to look at now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the technology so far away, there was a pretty diverse idea of what a driverless car might look like. Some were 22nd-century sleek, while others were bulbous, bordering on spherical creations, which seemed to exist outside of time and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some prophesied functionality far beyond what's currently available -- flying cars, anyone? -- but as the reality of self-driving cars comes more and more into focus, a design language is starting to emerge. It might seem boring, but self-driving cars look a lot like regular old human-driven cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, some autonomous vehicle designers are still drawing up concepts with the same joyous sense of possibility that made the idea of the self-driving car intriguing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is certainly the case with a new design from &lt;a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/en/" target="new"&gt;Rinspeed AG&lt;/a&gt;, a "creative think tank and mobility lab for the automotive industry." Known as the &lt;a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/en/Snap_48_concept-car.html" target="new"&gt;Rinspeed Snap&lt;/a&gt;, the box-like vehicle features a chassis referred to as a "skateboard" that can separate from the passenger compartment, known as the "cell." Snap skateboards are designed to be interchangeable with different cells, depending on what the vehicle is being used for on any given trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The pod can even be useful when stationary: it can be anything from a variable shopping pod or a spacious camping pod to a cozy cuddling pod and even provide a breathtaking, fully connected user experience for the occupants of the passenger cabin," Rinspeed wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/upload/conceptfiles/SnapMainPR2018.pdf" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The sky is here the limit for the possible applications."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing to design a series of use-specific passenger cabins instead of a single versatile cabin is a fascinating example of futuristic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept probably belongs to a future that's quite far away, but it's fun to imagine choosing between pods designed for business meetings, movie viewing, or sleeping depending on the purpose of your journey. &lt;a href="https://blog.caranddriver.com/kiss-me-im-in-an-autonomous-car-rinspeed-snap-concept-is-for-cuddling/" target="new"&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/a&gt; rightly seized on the humor of the idea of a "cozy cuddling pod," but hey, why not? Autonomous vehicle passengers will need to redirect their attention &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734361" target="new"&gt;somewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinspeed equipped its theoretical concept vehicle with components that do not exist yet. For example, Rinspeed said the Snap would feature a "True Level 5 HMI" (human-machine interface) designed by &lt;a href="https://services.harman.com/" target="new"&gt;Harman&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, just like every other automotive or tech company, Harman is yet to design a system for level 5 vehicular autonomy. But the Snap is also said to be powered by the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735132" target="new"&gt;Harman Ignite platform&lt;/a&gt; for connected cars, a product that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; exist. Other companies whose products, both real and imagined, are involved include ZF, Borbet, Sika Automotive, Gentex, Ibeo, Boeing and NXP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This AV concept release has become an annual tradition for Rinspeed, with the designs growing zanier each year. The 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/en/Budii_23_concept-car.html" target="new"&gt;Budii&lt;/a&gt; looked something like a hybrid sedan of today. But the 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.rinspeed.eu/en/Oasis_21_concept-car.html" target="new"&gt;Oasis&lt;/a&gt; had an aesthetic straight out of the Star Wars prequels. (The Snap is Rinspeed's 2018 design.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in order for autonomous vehicle design to move forward by leaps and bounds, companies like Rinspeed need to continue keeping it weird. Because you never know which out-of-left-field idea will make it into a real vehicle someday.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Companies vying to compete in an emerging sector often place a heavy emphasis on being the first to market with a new product. For a limited but invaluable amount of time, the company successful in doing so will face literally no competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the first to &lt;em&gt;announce&lt;/em&gt; a new product allows a company to be the center of attention in the press, which can have a great influence on public perception and brand identity. But the Ricky Bobby mantra from &lt;em&gt;Talladega Nights&lt;/em&gt;, "If you're not first, you're last," doesn't always hold true in business. And being beaten to market is not necessarily a sign of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple was far from the first to sell an MP3 player or make a smartphone, but that didn't stop the iPod and iPhone from establishing dominant market positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's certainly what &lt;a href="http://www.thortrucks.com/" target="new"&gt;Thor Trucks&lt;/a&gt; is hoping for with its new offering. Thor announced its forthcoming all-electric semi truck -- the ET-One -- a few weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; made major news with the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738351" target="new"&gt;unveiling of its own Semi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Thor may have lost the first-to-announce battle, the trucking startup is hoping to win the war. They already have one advantage. As Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/this-electric-truck-will-probably-beat-tesla-s-to-market" target="new"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt; in its headline, "This electric truck will probably beat Tesla's to market."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an expected launch in 2019, the same as Tesla's Semi, not much is yet known about the ET-One. But Thor's electric truck will cost between $150,000 to $250,000, depending on configuration. The battery on Thor's truck can be fully charged in 90 minutes and has a range of 300 miles. The maximum speed of the ET-One will be 70 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does that compare to the Semi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Tesla models with a 300-mile battery range will cost $150,000, while the 500-mile range model will cost $180,000. Since the ET-One's range is billed as "up to" 300 miles, it's possible that only the pricier $250,000 model will be able to travel that far. If that's correct, the Tesla Semi would be a significantly better value than the ET-One when it comes to cost-per-mile. But it's tough to make too many apples-to-apples comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla says its Semi can travel up to 65 mph up a 5% grade. But Thor puts no qualifiers on its 70-mph top speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Tesla does have the advantage of being able to generate good PR whenever a new company places an order for Semis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list already includes &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/pepsico-tesla-orders/pepsico-makes-biggest-public-pre-order-of-tesla-semis-100-trucks-idUSL1N1OB1YR" target="new"&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/anheuser-busch-preorders-40-tesla-semis.html" target="new"&gt;Anheuser-Busch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/wal-mart-says-its-planning-to-test-teslas-new-electric-trucks.html" target="new"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thor, for its part, isn't taking pre-orders. They have said that they will, however, put on demos through 2018, and eventually open up pre-ordering before the truck is released. Elon Musk's &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16669142/tesla-semi-roadster-2017-supercut-watch" target="new"&gt;dramatic initial unveiling&lt;/a&gt; aside, Tesla has indicated no intentions to demo the Semi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a reputation for failing to deliver its products to market in a timely fashion, a number of automotive industry insiders are skeptical about when the Semi will actually arrive, and if it will live up to its purported specs. But even if it does, and even if the ET-One's performance isn't quite as impressive, it may not matter. Thor has explicitly said that it's targeting the short-haul trucking market, perhaps even taking on delivery vans and work vehicles. The ET-One is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There's a tendency to simplify the truck market and think there will be one winner here," Thor CEO Dakota Semler told Bloomberg. "The reality is that there are all kinds of work trucks, and we're designing a type of transportation lab to cater to all of these."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Global auto supplier Bosch has now launched a connected mobility technology division, which includes the acquisition of a US-based ridesharing service startup, Splitting Fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is for the new division to further extend its existing service portfolio, promoting mobility technologies that can send alerts about wrong-way drivers or turn smartphones into car keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aggressive investor in autonomous vehicle technology, Bosch likely sees the potential for growth in ride-sharing, which encompasses online services and apps for carpools as well as for arranging driving services and taxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://splt.io/"target="new"&gt;Splitting Fares&lt;/a&gt; has developed a platform that organizations might use to arrange ridesharing for their staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, founded in 2015, has some 140,000 users in the US, Mexico, and Germany. The company has collected about $1.3 million in venture capital funding, according to &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/splitting-fares--splt-#section-overview"target="new"&gt;CrunchBase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its approach is aimed directly at commuters, with an app bringing together user who want to share a ride to the same workplace or place of study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main selling point behind the idea is that rides are shared by colleagues, which means users never have to get in the car with complete strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An algorithm is designed to locate a suitable ride-share vehicle, then it calculates the fastest route through traffic, and coordinates the departure point, departure time, best route and passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chairman of the Bosch board of management, Volkmar Denner, speaking at a company conference in Berlin, &lt;a href="http://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/bosch-establishes-division-for-connected-mobility-services-144832.html/"target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition is part of their plan to rapidly grow their service portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2022, the number of ride-sharing users worldwide is set to rise by 60% to 685 million, according to a recent Statista &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/368/100/ride-sharing/worldwide#/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, most such services have been directed at people who happen to be traveling in the same direction or who want to book a trip at the last minute, while companies and commuters have been seen as less of a priority -- something Splitting Fares was angling to change.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;"Connectivity will fundamentally change how we get from A to B, and in the process it will help to solve todays traffic problems," Denner said. "We are using it to realize our vision of emissions-free, stress-free, and accident-free mobility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to explain the company feels connectivity offers tremendous business potential, noting that by 2025, there will be more than 470 million connected vehicles on the worlds roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a PwC report indicates, in only four years from now, the market for mobility services and associated digital services will be worth $175 million.

&lt;p&gt;"Connectivity is a way for us to rethink not just the car but the whole way we use modes of transport," Denner said. "For Bosch, mobility goes beyond the car. Our expertise puts us in a position to develop and operate cross-application ecosystems."

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Mercedes-Benz parent company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740316"target="new"&gt;Daimler and Bosch&lt;/a&gt; let the world know"target="new"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they are partnering on a self-driving taxi that would begin testing itself on city streets in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Connected cars give consumers more ways to spend money while driving. SAP has now made some deals that will help grease the wheels for those transactions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Three major companies have signed on to use the &lt;a href="https://www.sap.com/products/connected-car-apps-network.html" target="new"&gt;SAP Vehicles Network&lt;/a&gt;, a B2B marketplace that brings together providers of services with channels for selling them in cars. SAP announced the new customers today at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard will provide an in-car payment mechanism, Here will supply navigation capabilities, and Postmates will make its on-demand delivery service available to other businesses through the marketplace. In addition, SAP has integrated its own Concur Expense product with the Vehicles Network, through the Concur App Center, so mobile workers can more easily report trip details. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;SAP launched the network in 2015 to help realize the commercial potential of in-vehicle Internet connections. Since then, more models have become connected and automakers and others have worked to make more services available in cars. For example, Ford offers tools to shop for parking and gas in its &lt;a href="https://www.fordpass.com/en_us/app.html" target="new"&gt;FordPass app&lt;/a&gt;. SAP Vehicles Network has about 50 customers now, but the deals SAP announced on Tuesday might do a lot to propel it forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the SAP Vehicles Network is that many types of businesses, including gas stations, parking lots and restaurants, want to reach consumers while they're driving. Connected cars make that possible, but not every provider of a service can have its own sales channel in the car. They need to work through channels such as automakers, car-rental companies, enterprises and mobile app providers to get in front of drivers. The network also includes suppliers of components for automotive services, such as navigation and payment systems. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The heart of SAP Vehicles Network is a common API that lets all those players meet in the cloud. SAP supplies the API and collects a per-transaction fee when it's used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API is agnostic to mobile platforms and car brands. It can be used for many applications, but for now it's available in versions for parking, fuel and food, Gil Perez, SAP's senior vice president of IoT and Digital Supply Chain, told Connected Car. They are designed to make those types of transactions easier, Perez said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, a driver who's running late can find available parking spaces near a destination, reserve one of those spaces ahead of time, and pay for the space without taking out cash or a credit card, he said. The location of the chosen parking space can be sent to the car's navigation system, and the gate to the lot can be automatically opened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API includes code for each of those steps. With the Vehicles Network, SAP wants to help parking companies offer spaces across the US on a single service by using the common API. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that Here has joined the network, parking services providers will have a way to integrate Here's navigation platform into their software to help drivers find spaces, Perez said. Payments will play into even more types of in-car services. MasterCard is making its tokenized payment system available for secure transactions on the SAP Vehicles Network. The system replaces a consumer's personal account number with a secure token, or alternative number, to keep transactions safe. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With it, consumers can buy gas or make other purchases from inside the car without having to hand over their credit cards, SAP says. Features for customer loyalty programs and analytics will also be available for those transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postmates integration will give merchants a way to reach drivers who want to order ahead and pick something up at home or the office. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;SAP's Concur Expense can use information from other components and services that use the Vehicles Network API, Perez said. For example, employees can automatically add mileage statistics or gas purchases to an expense report rather than filling out forms. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Two disability rights organizations and three disabled people are suing Uber for alleged discrimination, saying the company's wheelchair-accessible service is rarely, if ever, available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest challenge to Uber over access for the disabled comes from the company's own back yard. The plaintiffs in the suit are based in San Francisco and nearby Alameda County, across the bay. They're represented by &lt;a href=" http://dralegal.org/press/uber-sued-by-disability-rights-groups-for-illegal-discrimination-against-wheelchair-users/#files" target="new"&gt;Disability Rights Advocates&lt;/a&gt;, a national nonprofit organization.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The would-be class-action suit alleges that Uber advertises a wheelchair-accessible service, UberWAV, but riders find they can barely get a ride with it. The plaintiffs say their tests showed UberWAV was unavailable 80% of the time in San Francisco and was never available in Alameda County. They tested it 60 times in San Francisco and 120 times in Alameda County. Riders in wheelchairs wait an average of five times longer than other customer for a ride, and sometimes as much as 14 times longer, according to DRA.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;"Uber purports to offer access to wheelchair accessible vehicles to users in the Bay
Area. However, although the app includes an UberWAV button, the reality is that this button is a
sham. UberWAV does not provide effective service to people who need UberWAVs," the &lt;a href=" http://dralegal.org/press/uber-sued-by-disability-rights-groups-for-illegal-discrimination-against-wheelchair-users/#files" target="new"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; claims.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Also, customers in wheelchairs can't use any other Uber services, such as UberPool, UberSUV, or the high-end UberBlack and UberSelect, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber has proved it can provide better service to the disabled with expanded offerings in London, other UK cities and Philadelphia, the plaintiffs claim. Their suit, filed on Tuesday, February 27, in Alameda County Superior Court, doesn't ask for monetary damages but asks the court to force Uber to give disabled people equal access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement by email, Uber said it's always working to expand access.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"We take this issue seriously, and are continuously exploring ways to facilitate mobility and freedom via the Uber App for all riders, including riders who use motorized wheelchairs," according to Uber's statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-demand ride services such as Uber could be a boon to people who have difficulty taking buses and trains and getting to and from transit stops. With so many individual cars operating around the clock, they may allow for more spontaneous trips than travelers could take with traditional paratransit or dial-a-ride services.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Some cities, such as Santa Monica, Calif., have &lt;a href=" http://smdp.com/dial-a-ride-to-see-major-overhaul-next-year/163532" target="new"&gt;contracted&lt;/a&gt; with private ride-hail companies to replace overburdened or inconvenient city services. Others, including New York City, have started &lt;a href=" http://www.metro-magazine.com/accessibility/news/726331/new-york-mta-to-offer-real-time-on-demand-service-for-paratransit-users" target="new"&gt;their own services&lt;/a&gt; that emulate the private offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;But this isn't the first time Uber has been accused of not doing enough for people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last July, DRA represented disability rights groups in New York City that sued Uber alleging &lt;a href=" http://dralegal.org/press/ubers-lack-accessible-vehicles-shuts-wheelchair-users-five-boroughs/" target="new"&gt;unfair treatment&lt;/a&gt; by the company there. Similar suits have been filed in Chicago and Washington, DC. Also last year, as part of a &lt;a href=" https://www.uber.com/newsroom/nfb-settlement/" target="new"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; with the National Federation of the Blind, the company updated its policy on service animals and forcing drivers to acknowledge they're required to accept the animals on rides.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Traditional taxi companies aren't immune to such charges. In 2013, New York's taxi commission &lt;a href=" https://nypost.com/2013/12/06/half-of-nyc-taxis-to-be-wheelchair-accessible-by-2020/" target="new"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to make half of the city's cabs wheelchair-accessible by 2020 to settle a class-action suit.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Toyota hopes its new autonomous-driving software company will help it compete in that red-hot technology sector against rivals old and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota and two automotive components suppliers &lt;a href="https://newsroom.toyota.co.jp/en/corporate/21315381.html" target="new"&gt;will invest&lt;/a&gt; more than 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion) in the new company, Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development (TRI-AD). One of their first tasks will be to recruit self-driving technology experts from around the world, growing to about 1,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The fight to be first in self-driving cars pits giant automakers against huge technology companies and has created fierce competition for engineers who can develop autonomous systems and software. The race for talent is part of what led &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740419" target="new"&gt;Waymo and Uber&lt;/a&gt; into court last month and has sent &lt;a href=" https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/03/27/autonomous-car-race-creates-400k-engineering-jobs-for-top-silicon-valley-talent/#4c74a22214a3" target="new"&gt;salaries&lt;/a&gt; for some jobs in Silicon Valley above $400,000. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Toyota has had some wins in this game. To build its Silicon Valley robotics and AI research operation, &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/toyota-to-invest-1-billion-in-ai-and-robotics-rd" target="new"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, starting in 2015, it hired James Kuffner from Google's self-driving car operation and Gill Pratt from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Now Kuffner will run TRI-AD, which will be based in Tokyo and focused on software, while Pratt remains in charge of the California operation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's major automakers are aggressively developing autonomous car technology, racing among themselves and against tech giants like Waymo, Uber and China's Baidu to corner the biggest automotive shift since cars were invented. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Toyota is by some measures the largest car manufacturer in the world, making about 10 million vehicles per year. It was a pioneer in lean manufacturing, a method of cutting waste and saving time in factories and supply chains. Now the company wants to streamline its software development through methods that sound a bit like Silicon Valley's DevOps methodology, which is designed to make R&amp;D teams work more closely with the production side. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;There are more steps to iterating the code into car than in a mobile app, but Toyota, TRI and the new Tokyo-based company aim to work together to better translate research into reality.
Toyota has been partnering, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bertelschmitt/2016/09/09/toyota-bets-big-on-autonomous-tech-swallows-millimeter-radar-maker/#64ec87c56195" target="new"&gt;acquiring companies&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrating concepts in autonomous driving for years, even though rivals such as General Motors and Volkswagen Group sometimes get more attention. A Thomson Reuters &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/01/toyota-has-1400-self-driving-car-patentstwice-as-many-as-any-other-company/" target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 said Toyota had 1,400 self-driving car patents, more than any other company. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Last September, Toyota &lt;a href="http://corporatenews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+research+institute+demonstrates+progress+advanced+technology+research.htm" target="new"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; both a Level 4 self-driving system called Chauffeur, for cars to drive themselves in certain geographic areas, and a driver assistance system called Guardian that would work in less advanced cars. Guardian could alert drivers to hazards and step in with crash avoidance if necessary. At International CES earlier this year, Toyota &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=739667" target="new"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; the e-Palette Concept Vehicle, a flexible self-driving platform that's designed to be adapted for uses that could include ride-sharing, pizza delivery, stores on wheels and mobile living spaces. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Industries tend to coalesce around certain regions. Sometimes, it's due to geography, as with the lumber industry in the Pacific Northwest. Sometimes, it's more circumstantial. But when a city or region becomes known as "The Home of X," the implications can be far-reaching. &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;In today's accelerated development cycles, industries can pop up quickly, forcing a city to play catch-up to accommodate the new businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicles, however, are a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the technology has advanced greatly in recent years, it is still deep in the development and testing stages and still not "ready for prime time." That doesn't mean it's vaporware though. The autonomous vehicle revolution is coming -- there is little debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this means cities find themselves at a rare moment where they can establish themselves early in an industry that could help set the region's course for decades to come. And the race to become the home of the autonomous car industry is very much on.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The market for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles could grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and finally to $290 billion in 2035, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/technology-driving-innovation/cars-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;2016 Goldman Sachs study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areas around the United States want to be the place where that business is taking place. There are certain areas one's mind naturally gravitates toward. There's Detroit, the home of the automobile industry, or Silicon Valley, the birthplace of the technology driving the connected car industry. Still, these areas are far from the only players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a series on autonomous cars, the Detroit Free Press and USA Today Network &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/06/26/cities-lure-self-driving-car-jobs-gold-rush/101178670/" target="_blank"&gt;looked at nine different regions&lt;/a&gt; to explore the current state of the industry in the area and its chances of luring more business in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
 
{image 1}

&lt;p&gt;The nine cities featured include the likely candidates mentioned above that have related industries. However, there are other areas that are home to universities where cutting-edge research is being conducted, which, in turn, is spawning talented engineers who are developing new startups. These include Austin, Boston, Columbus, Nashville, Reno, Phoenix and Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Austin's mayor has called his city "The Kitty Hawk of driverless cars" for its pioneering role, which includes being the site of Waymo's first fully autonomous test drive. And while the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M may be rivals on the football field, the two institutions have joined together to become part of a consortium that is creating a network of proving grounds and testing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Columbus recently beat out seven other finalists for $50 million in federal and private funding to spur its driverless car industry. The city has received buy-in for its efforts from companies already based in Columbus. Victoria's Secret parent company, L Brands, is particularly interested in utilizing autonomous fleet technology to make its shipping and warehousing more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Reno has also emerged as a big player. Its proximity to California, dry climate and wide open spaces make it an ideal location. Nevada was the first state to adopt legislation allowing the testing of self-driving cars and it hasn't really taken its foot off the gas since. Google recently purchased 1,210 acres at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, and while it has not said what it will do with the space, it's not hard to imagine becoming a facility for Waymo. And Tesla's massive Gigafactory is outside of Reno churning out the batteries that will power its cars, all of which it plans to eventually equip with self-driving technology.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Then there's the big boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major automakers in Detroit are all pulling for the city to become what Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford calls "ground zero" for the future of mobility. It remains to be seen how strong that commitment is, especially should autonomous vehicles start to infringe on the automakers' bread-and-butter revenue streams. But the large-scale infrastructure required for testing autonomous vehicles is definitely in place.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley, meanwhile, views autonomous vehicles more as computers than cars and the Northern California region is still the unquestioned hub of the US tech sector, both at the behemoth level and the startup level. Not to mention, it's home to a number of top engineering universities such as Stanford.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;It's too early to tell which city will win the race. And we're early enough in the contest that another city could still emerge. But it's easy to understand why state and local governments are rolling out the red carpet. The chances to completely transform a city's identity don't come along all that often, and when they do, you don't want to be left sticking a thumb in the air trying to hitch a ride. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As if industry excitement for the new Nissan Leaf weren't already high enough, the Japanese automaker announced that the hotly anticipated electric car would feature semi-autonomous ProPilot Assist technology that will aid users driving on the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Nissan first revealed ProPilot to the public in July 2016, and introduced it as an exclusive to the Japanese market in October as a feature of the Serena minivan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ProPilot does not offer the capabilities that would be expected from a fully autonomous car, its abilities are useful and significant. Designed for highway driving, ProPilot Assist is activated -- and deactivated -- by a switch on the steering wheel. Once turned on, ProPilot fully takes over single-lane highway driving until the car's human driver decides to take over. Using advanced image-processing technology, the system steers, accelerates and brakes as appropriate, going as fast as the user decides (within reason) while maintaining a safe distance from surrounding cars.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;As is necessary for all autonomous vehicle technology, the ProPilot Assist is prepared to deal with dangerous traffic situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ProPilot system automatically applies the brakes to bring the vehicle to a full stop," &lt;a href="http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/nissan-s-new-serena-propilot-technology-makes-autonomous-drive-first-for-japanese-automakers"target="new"&gt;according to Nissan&lt;/a&gt;. "After coming to a full stop, the vehicle will remain in place even if the driver's foot is off the brake pedal. When ready to resume driving, ProPilot is activated when the driver touches the switch again or lightly presses the accelerator."&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The fact that the technology is being integrated into the Leaf makes this a particularly exciting development, as the Leaf is already one of the most innovative cars in the market. First introduced in 2010, the Leaf is the best-selling highway-capable electric car of all time. Naturally, each new model year is eagerly awaited.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The ProPilot announcement aside, little is known about the forthcoming Leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, according to TechCrunch, it's not the only groundbreaking advancement that could be involved with the latest model. "The redesigned version of [the Leaf]... is still 'coming soon' and mostly still a secret," &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/23/nissans-propilot-driver-assist-features-coming-to-the-new-leaf-ev/"target="new"&gt;reports the website&lt;/a&gt;. "We do, however, expect it to have around 200 miles of range on some models, which is more than double the current version."&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Between its pre-existing status as an electric vehicle and the forthcoming introduction of the ProPilot Assist, the Leaf will now be a big-time player in multiple emerging automobile markets. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15861240/nissan-leaf-propilot-autonomous-driving-sneak-peek"target="new"&gt;As The Verge reports&lt;/a&gt;, Nissan is competing with the Chevy Bolt and Tesla's Model 3 for the sub-$40,000 electric cars market, and it is also a competitor in the autonomous vehicle space. In the latter category it joins, of course, there are plenty of other automakers soon to join the fray.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Nissan has announced plans to introduce highway lane-switching technology as a feature of ProPilot as soon as 2018, which would essentially make equipped vehicles fully autonomous while on the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging autonomous vehicle technology that promotes safety, accessibility and convenience puts automobiles at the forefront of the conversation when we discuss the transportation of tomorrow. So does emerging electric technology that reduces energy usage and air pollution. In pairing these two types of innovation into one vehicle, Nissan is giving us a sneak peek at the automobile of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Vodafone Germany has launched a new telematics service in the form of a smartphone app, and its first partner for the technology is German insurance agency Wrttembergische Versicherung. The insurer will offer the app to customers under the age of 30, whose driving patterns will be recorded in the app and shared with the insurance firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/uk/news/commercial-vehicles/vodafone-insurer-tie-up-for-phone-telematics-app-71801.aspx" target="new"&gt;Vodafone's app&lt;/a&gt;, which may soon be picked up by other insurers, will use smartphone sensors to track vehicle speed, acceleration, deceleration and turning patterns. The data generated will be analyzed in a central telematics server, which will then generate a "personal driving score" for users' individual trips and their driving at large. It will also offer users specific tips on how to improve their driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this information will be shared with both Wrttembergische Versicherung and the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the insurer, this data collection and analysis could offer invaluable insight on the behavior of individual customers, as well as entire subcategories of their clientele. The driving tips that the app gives to users will seek to help them lower their premiums, according to Vodafone. However, it is unclear the extent to which an individual user could lower his or her premium through tracking changes in their driving behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership between Vodafone and Wrttembergische Versicherung represents an early step in a larger trend of insurers adopting telematics technology. This past May, &lt;a href="http://www.ptolemus.com/" target="new"&gt;Ptolemus Consulting Group&lt;/a&gt; released a report predicting that by 2030, 50% of the world's vehicles will be insured through policies predicated on tracked usage. The report also projects that the number of usage-based insurance policies will grow to nearly 100 million globally within the next three years.
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=904"target="new"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt;, the project has been a few years in the making. In 2014, Vodafone acquired Italian car technology company Cobra Automotive, which specializes in car telematics software, for 145 million ($165.4 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not, however, Vodafone's first telematics product offering. In partnership with Vodafone Automotive, Porsche offers a tiered subscription service called Porsche Car Connect that uses telematics to provide various safety services, including automatic emergency calls in case of breakdown or vehicle tracking in case of theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodafone's app will compete with other telematics insurance products such as &lt;a href="https://www.allstate.com/drive-wise.aspx" target="new"&gt;Allstate's Drivewise&lt;/a&gt;, which is a small device users can plug into their car's onboard diagnostic port to track driving behavior. Like Wrttembergische Versicherung's new program, Drivewise offers users an opportunity to reduce their insurance premiums through safe driving -- by as much as 30%, Allstate says. Vodafone's new app will be collecting data from smartphone hardware, while Drivewise gathers it directly from the vehicle. Whether a smartphone can track diagnostics with similar accuracy remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Wrttembergische Versicherung customers under the age of 30, the possibility of saving money will serve as a worthy incentive to use the new app, especially since it's for a demographic that pays relatively high premiums for auto insurance. Further, those genuinely seeking to become better drivers may find the app's safe driving tips to be helpful. There is the potential that telematics technology could alienate some customers if, for example, less-than-stellar driving reports caused their premiums to rise. But in its current application, telematics insurance technology offers only positives for drivers on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As things stand right now, the self-driving car arms race is wide open. Seemingly every automaker is all-in on investing heavily in the production of autonomous vehicles, with many aiming to have products on the road within the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ride-sharing services such as Lyft and Uber are seeking to establish fleets of AVs to shuttle their urban passengers from one destination to the next. At the same time, Alphabet -- the parent company of &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=652"target="new"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; -- is designing its own self-driving cars, while &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=723"target="new"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; is looking to make sure its technology is present in self-driving cars of every make and model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even legacy rental car services such as Avis and Hertz are in the game, with these two companies forging partnerships with Waymo and &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=956"target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the self-driving car industry and the auto industry at large, this is incredibly good to see. Healthy competition among companies fosters innovation, and everyone -- including the consumer -- comes out as a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group, however, would like to see more definitive "winners" in the race to get self-driving cars on the road: investors. With so many players involved in the autonomous vehicles game, traders have little idea which companies could net them a fortune and which may end up as duds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of merely rolling the dice on tech firms or auto companies that work on self-driving cars, investors are opening up their imaginations to ways in which other enterprises may see their business affected by a driverless world. Some estimates say that the elimination of driving will free up 600 billion hours annually for those who would otherwise need to keep their eyes on the road. Naturally, figuring out how those hours will be spent is a top priority for analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's all about the adjacencies," Adam Jones, automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-05/go-long-chicken-wings-the-hunt-for-driverless-car-winners-is-on"target="new"&gt;told Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. "If you invest in that, you're less likely to be buying an over-hyped situation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Film and television are old stand-by industries that will certainly benefit from the usage of autonomous vehicles. Backseat VHS and DVD players have long been a staple of on-the-go children's entertainment in minivans and similarly sized vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, without the need for eyes on the road, a two-hour drive can turn into family movie night. Solo commuters, too, will surely step up their watching habits in a post-driver world. The daily binge-watching of half-hour television series is already a regular habit of those who commute by means other than the automobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in entertainment, one already-emerging industry stands out as having much to gain from the widespread usage of driverless cars: video games. Gaming generated a stunning &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/21/worldwide-game-industry-hits-91-billion-in-revenues-in-2016-with-mobile-the-clear-leader/"target="new"&gt;$91 billion&lt;/a&gt; in revenues in 2016, with mobile gaming easily representing the largest segment at $41 billion. It's not hard to imagine the same technology that will enable autonomous vehicles to share the road also allowing gamers to connect with one another from separate automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food and drink is an especially interesting market space to watch as self-driving cars begin to hit our roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers and distributors of alcohol are surely thrilled by the possibilities that AV technology opens up for beer or liquor consumption in personal automobiles since it could eliminate the idea of drunk driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For food, the outlook could be slightly less rosy. Pre-set destinations and automated driving may reduce the number of impulse decisions that steer so many into fast food drive-through. However, self-driving cars also make eating in the car a whole lot easier. On-the-road restaurants that recognize this and innovate accordingly may find that they do better business than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are right to be wary of any AV company that's billed as a "sure thing," as no company is predestined for success in this developing market. They should, however, apply that same logic to their investments located tangentially to self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the world of widespread autonomous vehicle usage is here, we don't know exactly what it will look like.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;With the emergence of the connected car, an arms race of sorts is taking place among automakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid and widespread introduction of new technologies into vehicles is giving OEMs access to unprecedented amounts of data on drivers and how they drive. The challenge is to not only synthesize and understand this data, but to then leverage it into different product offerings, improved customer experiences and create new revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The established car companies aren't competing with each other anymore. Startups that may not have as much history in disc brakes, but are experts in data collection and analysis, are emerging as power players as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some automakers, like Toyota, are fighting fire with fire and behaving like startups themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loose, nimble and flexible attitudes and practices of a startup are certainly reflected in Toyota Connected, the Japanese automaker's year-old subsidiary that specializes in data harvesting. For one thing, the operation is conspicuously absent from Toyota's enormous new Dallas campus. Though it's only a mile away, it feels much different, housed in an open office replete with Silicon Valley-style trappings like video game machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad distinction between the startup and the more established Toyota North America operation was a deliberate choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That was some of the direction [Japan] gave me when we started this company," Toyota Connected CEO Zack Hicks told &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170710/OEM06/170719963/toyota-connected-data" target="new"&gt;Automotive News&lt;/a&gt;. "They said, 'Don't overlay the big company processes on this new startup. Let's create our ability to move faster.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the work at Toyota Connected has largely consisted of building a cloud infrastructure and various platforms to manage data that it isn't receiving yet. That, however, will change soon. The forthcoming &lt;a href="http://www.cleveland.com/automotive/plaindealer/index.ssf/2017/07/new_2018_camry_is_a_game_changer_for_toyota.html" target="new"&gt;2018 Camry&lt;/a&gt; will be Toyota's first model on the market that tracks and reports an incredible array of diagnostics back to the company. &lt;/p
&lt;p&gt;In his interview with Automotive News, Hicks described the type of features that Toyota could bolster with that data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;So, when you're in the car in the morning, I know that you are going to be late because of traffic and if I'm connected to your calendar I can just say, "Hey, do you want to let the meeting organizer know that you're running late? And by the way you need gas, and here's the cheapest place on your route."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Connected has been a success almost out of the gate. In April, the company announced that its startup would double in size from 100 to 200 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The amount of interest and demand in leveraging our big data to create new products and services has been incredible," Hicks wrote &lt;a href="http://corporatenews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+connected+double+headcount+plano.htm" target="new"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Over the past year we've been scaling up to deliver on these new opportunities, which will significantly impact the way consumers interact with vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Toyota Media Service Corporation, Toyota's digital marketing company, &lt;a href="https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/17/06/a9593301/toyota-media-service-to-change-name-to-toyota-connected-corporation" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was changing its name to Toyota Connected Corporation. In leveraging the young identity of Toyota Connected to rebrand other parts of the corporation, higher-ups at Toyota are signaling a strong fondness for what the startup has achieved thus far, and for what it can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;While the self-driving car recently come to the forefront of American technological discourse in this decade, the underpinning technology that drives today's autonomous vehicles has been in the works much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, competitions like the AUVSI Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and the DARPA Urban Challenge incentivized engineers, designers and researchers to take on the challenge of creating autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competing and placing in both of those competitions were teams from Virginia Tech University -- including a group that earned a million-dollar grant and placed third in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. Born out of those trials and triumphs was &lt;a href="http://torc.ai/" target="new"&gt;Torc Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, which stationed itself close by the Hokies campus in Blacksburg. For over ten years now, Torc has designed innovative solutions for a wide variety of commercial projects ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/autonomous-military-vehicle-called-guss-revolutionize-battlefield-2/" target="new"&gt;autonomous military vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.janes.com/article/63796/saving-lives-on-the-move-aad16d2" target="new"&gt;robots that make mining safer&lt;/a&gt; and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Torc is returning to the realm of self-driving cars for consumers, the same field in which it made waves in that 2007 challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, Torc Robotics announced that it was developing a self-driving car system for consumer automobiles. All of the technology has been developed internally, including the essential localization, tracking and object detection systems that seemingly every automaker has been racing to build, as well as mapping and navigation systems built by Torc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is not building the cars themselves. Instead it is creating technology that could, theoretically, live inside any make of vehicle. Although it's possible that Torc could find an exclusive OEM for its products, the company seems more interested in its current business model of catering to a wide number of clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our role is more of an enabler," CEO Michael Fleming &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/torc-robotics-unveils-self-driving-system-for-consumer-cars/" target="new"&gt;told TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "We work with OEMs, tier 1s and tier 2s in the automotive space, taking our 10 years of experience and working with these organizations, outlining their road map moving forward. This is fairly new technology to a lot of the players in the automotive space, but this is something we've been doing every day for the last 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Torc's years of experience with automated vehicles, it should come as no surprise that its car technology is already far along despite just recently announcing it. Two Lexus RXs equipped with Torc's system have been on public roads since February, with one of them successfully making a 1,000-mile drive from Blacksburg to Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the company's origins rooted in self-driving cars, it's curious to see that it is now leveraging its technology to enter that market in earnest. So what took so long? According to Fleming, Torc was just waiting for everyone else to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What we've found is that some other markets that were early adopters to this technology, and there wasn't a great deal of interest in the automotive industry coming out of the DARPA Challenge," he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's clear that Torc has long had its eye on the self-driving consumer car space, and that the company was strategic and calculating in choosing when to jump into it. The fact that an AV pioneer like Torc is once again working with automobiles serves as further validation that this is an exciting time to be involved with self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Of all the lessons to be gleaned from the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe that should not be overlooked there is none more important than this: Never underestimate the capabilities of a vehicle-repairing droid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And while Kuka's robots may not have the galaxy-saving impact of R2D2, they will certainly be a tremendous asset to Volkswagen and their growing fleet of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German automaker and the German robotics company recently &lt;a href="https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/volkswagen-teams-kuka-car-service-robots/" target="new"&gt;struck an agreement&lt;/a&gt; where Kuka will design robots built specifically to service Volkswagen's self-driving cars, as well as service and charge VW's electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are working intensively on structuring the mobility of tomorrow," Volkswagen CEO Matthias Mller &lt;a href="https://www.kuka.com/-/media/kuka-corporate/documents/press/news/2017/07/press-release-kuka-and-volkswagen-conclude-new-cooperation-contract.pdf" target="new"&gt;wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "This is not simply about innovative vehicle concepts but encompasses completely new requirements in the service sector."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In choosing a partner to help sustain its self-driving car technology, Volkswagen picked a well established collaborator. Kuka is a leader in "&lt;a href="https://www.kuka.com/en-us/about-kuka" target="new"&gt;intelligent automation&lt;/a&gt;" across a broad range of industries, including energy, metals, healthcare and, of course, automotive. Kuka's &lt;a href="https://www.kuka.com/en-us/products/robotics-systems/industrial-robots" target="new"&gt;robot offerings&lt;/a&gt; are matched by few in terms of scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever new prototypes are in the works to service self-driving VW cars will likely look unlike anything currently on the market. (In 2015, Tesla introduced a robotic arm to charge its electric vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/08/glad-teslas-working-ultra-creepy-charging-arm/" target="new"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.) Kuka employs over 12,000 workers, many in its Augsburg headquarters, and posts around 3 billion ($3.4 billion) in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world's largest automaker (&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bertelschmitt/2017/01/30/its-official-volkswagen-worlds-largest-automaker-2016-or-maybe-toyota/#5973612e76b0" target="new"&gt;by some definitions&lt;/a&gt;), it should come as no surprise that Volkswagen is investing heavily in the research and development of self-driving car technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the company unveiled &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/07/volkswagen-self-driving-car-sedric/" target="new"&gt;Sedric&lt;/a&gt;, a self-driving car concept that looks more revolutionary than most of its competition. The company describes the van as being "subtly wedged shape," but, relative to cars currently on the road, there's nothing subtle about its radically rounded figure. The design has neither a steering wheel nor pedals and would employ a small device that users could push a button on to summon the car. Volkswagen Group proclaimed Sedric to be a "cross-brand ideas platform," suggesting the features on the concept vehicle could be rolled out across the VW's portfolio of assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the brands owned by Volkswagen Group, Audi and Porsche, already have full-fledged autonomous vehicle projects underway under their own umbrellas. Porsche is working with Formula One driver Mark Webber to design &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/db4bab68-5fd1-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1" target="new"&gt;racing technology&lt;/a&gt; that will shuttle laymen around race tracks at tops speeds, allowing them to experience the same thrills as the pros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audi has been especially ambitious. &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-car-user-interface/" target="new"&gt;The recently revealed A8&lt;/a&gt; will be the first consumer car available with Level 3 Automation, known as "conditional automation." The car will be able to drive itself for long periods of time without human assistance and will alert the human driver when he or she needs to take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Kuka's robots are actively servicing vehicles for Volkswagen proper, it's possible that the parent company could arrange for the products to work on Audis and Porsches, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Volkswagen and Kuka's joint announcement represents an encouraging step forward for the viability of fleets of self-driving cars, it does serve as another reminder of the effect that advancing technology could have on entire sectors of employment. When thinking about automotive jobs lost due to artificial intelligence and automation, most people's minds turn first to truckers. The capabilities of Kuka's robots prove that many jobs -- automotive or otherwise -- could theoretically be replaced by automation.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;One of the most intriguing aspects about the rise of autonomous vehicles is that players are entering from all corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automakers Ford, Volkswagen and Honda -- and pretty much everyone else -- have invested years and billions of dollars in research and development of autonomous vehicles. Of course, they're not alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley power players like Apple, Uber and Google -- in the form of parent company Alphabet's Waymo -- have been keeping pace, if not pulling ahead. Autonomous vehicle enthusiasts are expecting spectacular results from each sector. However, consumers, at least for now, seem to have more faith in one over the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.alixpartners.com/insights-impact/the-fast-changing-new-automotive-ecosystem-is-leaving-many-players-behind/#sm.00000l5lozv4ywfrlzaty2hftdwfk" target="new"&gt; survey of 1,000 drivers&lt;/a&gt; in ten major American markets conducted by Michigan-based global consulting firm AlixPartners, finds that consumers are significantly more likely to trust innovative and disruptive over tried and true when it comes to self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the survey, 41% reported that they would trust a Silicon Valley company the most when it comes to driverless car software. By comparison, 16% told researchers that they would trust a traditional American automaker the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is disheartening for automakers, as they tried to associate themselves with self-driving technology. Sixteen percent is a significantly low number, even relative to the not-so-impressive 41% attributed to Silicon Valley firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bright side for Detroit's auto manufacturers is that consumers simply might not be aware that these companies are working on autonomous vehicles. When asked to name a company working on self-driving car technology, 55% of respondents cited Tesla and 20% named Google. Only 12% named a legacy car company. While that still represents a problem for automakers, customer ignorance is a less daunting beast than active customer distrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For AlixPartners Managing Directors &lt;a href="https://www.alixpartners.com/our-professionals/john-hoffecker/" target="_blank"&gt;John Hoffecker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.alixpartners.com/our-professionals/mark-wakefield/" target="new"&gt;Mark Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, who led the study, a big takeaway was that the self-driving car industry will ultimately be unable to accommodate the bevy of participants currently striving to succeed in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are more than 50 creditable companies that are trying to develop an autonomous vehicle system... and a lot of them are wasting money right now," &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/07/12/driverless-cars-future/472482001/" target="new"&gt;Wakefield wrote in the report&lt;/a&gt;. "When you have 50 credible competitors, some with huge war chests, you really have to step back and recognize they are not all going to be successful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are going to be major changes in who is on top and who is not on top, overnight," &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-12/billions-will-be-blown-in-race-to-field-first-self-driving-cars" target="_blank"&gt;Hoffecker added&lt;/a&gt;. "The number of people who will succeed in autonomous in the future is going to be a handful. So you're going to find 90 percent of the investments, where people are spending tens and hundreds of millions-plus, will be completely thrown away."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any burgeoning industry is bound to have its winners and losers, but the directors at AlixPartners clearly feel that such a gap will be especially wide in the autonomous vehicle space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that opinion isn't shared by everyone, many investors are &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734361" target="new"&gt;hedging their bets&lt;/a&gt; by putting money into already established industries that could benefit from the proliferation of self-driving cars. One thing is certain: The winners in the driverless car space will be very big winners indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;One way to gauge the health of the connected car industry is to look at the products currently on the market, and those scheduled for release in the near future. With common connected car features like navigation, music streaming and other various apps improving and expanding with each model year, it's easy to see that the sector is growing at a healthy pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, beyond the customer-facing applications, automakers and suppliers are collaborating and innovating in new ways to keep pushing things forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 28, Toyota Motor North America announced that it was forming a new internal group &lt;a href="http://pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+creates+connected+technologies+group+advance+in+car+user+experience.htm" target="new"&gt;known as Connected Technologies&lt;/a&gt;. Starting immediately, the company will bring together about 100 employees with various backgrounds to work at Connected Technologies, which will be based in Plano, Texas. Those workers will be brought from existing Toyota divisions that focus on R&amp;D, information systems and connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In-car, connected vehicle technology is a high priority for us because its impact on the customer experience is becoming an increasingly important factor in their purchase decisions," CEO of Toyota Motor North America Jim Lentz, wrote in a statement. "Thanks to the new One Toyota structure, we are removing barriers among our North American teams that work on connected vehicles to create a more cohesive and empowered team to listen to and create an ever-better connected car experience for customers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734458" target="new"&gt;Toyota publicized Toyota Connected&lt;/a&gt;, a division with its own facility in Dallas that is meant to work with the speed and nimbleness of a startup. Toyota Connected, which had 66 employees as of mid-July and reported plans to eventually employ up to 200 people, focuses specifically on designing, building and refining connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I know how fast you are going down the road. I know what your trajectory is. I know how many people are sitting in the car. I know what music you're listening to," Toyota Connected CEO Zack Hicks &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170710/OEM06/170719963/toyota-connected-data" target="new"&gt;told Automotive News&lt;/a&gt; at the time. "I can give you services based on that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hicks will be in charge of the new Connected Technologies team in Plano. In the company's announcement, he expressed confidence that Toyota's growing allotment of resources towards connected cars will pay dividends in both the short and the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our new team will double-down our efforts on connected vehicles so we can provide our Toyota and Lexus customers a more human experience," he noted. "Connected vehicles are the next step in a personalized driving experience, emphasizing your preferences as a driver thanks to better technology, improving the customer's ownership experience over time."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reasons that largely have to do with similarities in naming, it can be a bit confusing differentiating between Connected Technologies, Toyota Connected, and other subdivisions of Toyota. But that isn't a bad thing. Toyota is devoting so many resources to connected cars that it's hard to keep track of them all. That should please consumers and investors alike.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;One of Shakespeare's most commonly quoted lines appears in Act II, Scene VII of &lt;em&gt;As You Like It&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With "All the world's a stage," the Bard compares life to a play and people to actors, constantly performing for one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 21st century version of the adage might be, "All the world's a screen." We increasingly watch life's performances not in real life (or "IRL," as the kids say) as they did in Shakespeare's time, but on screens, be they on on our televisions, computers or phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, perhaps, cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For entertainment companies, more screen time means more revenue generated through subscription fees or advertising deals. So it should come as no surprise that entertainment companies have their sights set on a future in which self-driving cars are commonplace on roads, and drivers are free to spend time that otherwise would be devoted to paying attention to the road. Reading, gaming and online shopping will all come into play, but the greatest potential is in streaming video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a possibility that is already being studied closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ernst &amp; Young's 2016 report titled "Internet of Things," the firm estimated the potential earnings for entertainment companies based on the assumption that the average American spends one hour a day in his or her car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If the focus during that time were to shift from concentrating on the road to watching video, that equates to more than $20 billion in incremental revenue for the video industry," &lt;a href="http://www.thewrap.com/self-driving-cars-hollywood-entertainment/" target="new"&gt;according to the report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty billion is a number that will make entertainment execs -- and any businessperson for that matter -- take notice. Hollywood sees the AV revolution coming slowly but surely, and they believe that a self-driving car is a perfectly constructed venue for watching television, film, live sports or other forms of video content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our mobile lifestyle is expanding into cars -- that is the next journey for entertainment. Hollywood is an important part of that discussion," Ted Schilowitz, futurist at Paramount Pictures, &lt;a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/why-driving-cars-could-be-hollywoods-next-big-thing-1031554" target="new"&gt;told the Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;. "If you look at the windshield and windows, they are 'screens' at the right distance to be entertainment portals. Can the windshield be the movie screen of tomorrow?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not at all a ridiculous idea, and it doesn't take someone with the job title of "futurist" to see why. The windshield of a car already essentially acts as a screen for viewing the road, making it a fairly ideal apparatus for watching video. However, Mercedes-Benz R&amp;D engineer Alex Hilliger questions whether the seat orientation of the cars of today will carry over to the self-driving cars of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're re-envisioning the automotive experience," said Hilliger in the article. "The vehicle could have a lounge atmosphere, and the passengers face forward or backward. If you don't need a steering wheel or driver's seat, the car can be a new space."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of uncertainty littering the road to our AV future, but a few things seem certain about that future itself. One of them is that when we're not driving, we won't just be absentmindedly gazing at the road in front of us. We'll be looking for entertainment, and Hollywood already can't wait to provide it, and profit from it.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For some, hearing the phrase, "Individualized, highly flexible, totally efficient local public transport" sounds like an oxymoron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly is not a way many would describe the current state of public transportation. Buses, subways and other forms of public transit are pretty much the exact opposite of "individualized," as crowded cars are a twice daily reality for commuters worldwide. And the only way most of them can be characterized as "flexible" is if you consider the regularity with which they deviate from their set schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that bold description -- word for word -- is exactly how Daimler described its latest prototype vehicle that could transform how people use and think about public transportation. The Smart Vision EQ Fortwo essentially checks off every single box of the automobile of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Smart Vision EQ Fortwo is also a car in which all of the individual fields of expertise that make up the CASE corporate strategy are combined, allowing users in the city intuitive access to individual mobility," &lt;a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/autonomous-concept-car-smart-vision-eq-fortwo#" target="new"&gt;according to the company's statement&lt;/a&gt;. "CASE stands for the strategic pillars of connectivity (Connected), autonomous driving (Autonomous), flexible use (Shared &amp; Services) and electric drive systems (Electric)."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most interesting of those four concepts is the third -- flexible use.&lt;/p&gt;

{videoembed | 736350}

&lt;p&gt;With each passing year, ride-sharing services -- and the fleet management they necessitate -- grow and become a more important factor in discussions about the future of transportation. As populations grow, cities become more densely populated and concerns about the environment become more severe, ride-sharing services become an ever more appealing solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Smart Vision EQ Fortwo is our vision of future urban mobility; it is the most radical car sharing concept car of all: fully autonomous, with maximum communication capabilities, friendly, comprehensively personalisable and, of course, electric," Annette Winkler, vice president of Daimler AG and CEO of Daimler division Smart Automobile, noted in the statement. "With the Smart Vision EQ Fortwo, we are giving a face to the themes with which Mercedes-Benz Cars describes the vision of future mobility within the CASE strategy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connected car enthusiasts -- and autonomous vehicle enthusiasts, and ride-share enthusiasts, and electric vehicle enthusiasts -- are getting their first look at the Fortwo design this month at the Frankfurt International Motor Show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the vehicle aiming for Level 5 autonomy, though, it will be some time before it (or, more likely, its design descendants) takes to the streets.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Like all bills, H.R. 3388 started in a subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislation, which reformulates the federal government's approach to regulating self-driving cars, was first devised by the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection panel, a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee made up of 14 Republicans and 10 Democrats. It passed 24-0 in the subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When brought to the Energy and Commerce Committee at large in July, it maintained its perfect record, once again garnering bipartisan support to pass unanimously, this time by a vote of 54-0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a political climate of intense partisanship, it goes without saying that this was remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, September 6, the bill -- known as the SELF DRIVE Act -- took its next step towards becoming law when the full House voted on it. And again, the legislation continued its unblemished record of bipartisan support, passing the House by a unanimous voice vote to advance to consideration in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The passage of the SELF DRIVE Act is an important milestone in the development, testing, and deployment of self-driving cars," &lt;a href="https://latta.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398481" target="new"&gt;said Republican Congressman Bob Latta of Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, who co-authored the bill as a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. "Autonomous vehicle technology has the possibility to reduce deaths on our nation's roadways by the tens of thousands, and accidents by the millions. At the same time, seniors and those living with disabilities would find their mobility greatly increased by self-driving cars. Today's passage of this legislation is the result of countless meetings, discussions, and hearings where stakeholders, federal officials, and Members of Congress shared their perspectives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has the ability to grant 2,500 exemptions annually to vehicles that do not meet normal safety standards, such as having a human driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these exemptions are granted to companies testing autonomous vehicles, but 2,500 is still a small number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new legislation proposes that annual exemptions immediately increase to 25,000 in year one, 50,000 in year two and 100,000 by year three. It also seeks to limit the ability of individual states to tighten AV restrictions within their own borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No State or political subdivision of a State may maintain, enforce, prescribe, or continue in effect any law or regulation regarding the design, construction, or performance of highly automated vehicles, automated driving systems, or components of automated driving systems unless such law or regulation is identical to a standard prescribed under this chapter," &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr3388/text/eh" target="new"&gt;reads an amendment&lt;/a&gt; of Section 30103 of title 49, United States code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill also mandates that subcommittees be formed to ensure that the disabled community -- particularly the blind -- and senior citizens are adequately served by services involving autonomous vehicles. Both groups stand to gain the most from this emerging technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues of cybersecurity, labor and the environment are also discussed in the Act, albeit not extensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Self-driving cars hold the promise of better access to transportation for our nation's 47 million senior citizens, 27 million Americans with severe disabilities, and the many communities across the country underserved by public transportation," &lt;a href="https://walden.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walden-helps-pass-landmark-legislation-pave-way-self-driving-cars" target="new"&gt;said Republican Congressman Greg Walden&lt;/a&gt; of Oregon, Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. "H.R. 3388 ensures their voices are heard by automakers and regulators as this technology develops."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislation now moves on to the Senate, where it will likely undergo at least a few minor tweaks before being brought to the floor for a vote. If the bipartisan support that the SELF DRIVE Act has seen thus far carries forward, though, it could be signed into law very soon.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Car keys have come a long way from their original iterations as simply pieces of custom-cut metal that could be inserted into a vehicle's ignition system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote keyless systems were first introduced in the early 1980s, allowing drivers to unlock their vehicle from a distance with the push of a button. They've become so commonplace, it's hard to imagine a time without them. Around 1995, transponder car keys first started rolling out. Using a programmed chip that disarms a car's immobilizer, transponder keys protected vehicles from being hot wired and stolen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, many car keys are not even keys at all, but remote devices that not only unlock your car but also act as a starter, all without a driver ever having to remove them from his or her pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem with these, however, is that they fail to unlock a car when the car battery is dead. Despite all our advances, we still need the old fashioned mechanical key when all else goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.continental-corporation.com/en" target="new"&gt;Continental&lt;/a&gt; has introduced a virtual, unforgeable key that opens doors and starts engines, with the unlocking capability still available even when a car's battery is dead. The new product design is centered around a present and future where car-sharing services and fleet management are more popular than ever, a circumstance that calls for a rethinking of how various automobile systems are accessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product is known as the Continental Smart Access system (CoSmA), and it allows for car doors that open and close independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The intelligent door is a milestone in access technology, as for the first time, we can offer users an all-round package for hands-free and digital operation, from unlocking the car and opening the door to starting the engine," &lt;a href="https://www.continental-corporation.com/en/press/press-releases/2017-08-29-intelligent-door-93854" target="new"&gt;Andreas Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, head of Continental's Body &amp; Security business unit, wrote in a statement. "With it, we are enabling an even more convenient and secure driving experience for drivers and offering more design freedom to manufacturers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The innovation of enabling a car door to open even when the car battery is dead comes via a new means of storing energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver's side door will have its own supply, taken from the car but stored in the door itself. NFC allows drivers to use the emergency unlock system from a smartphone, which activates a security check before unlocking the doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology could have major effects on vehicle design, according to Continental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It also opens up more design freedom for carmakers, as they no longer have to develop a conventional key with a blade and can dispense entirely with the emergency lock in the door," reads a statement. "In combination with the automatic door opener, even the entire door handle will become obsolete, which offers more options for the exterior design, whilst simultaneously improving the vehicle's aerodynamic resistance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ride-sharing and fleet management take up larger and larger market shares in automotives in the coming years, keep an eye on Continental and similarly minded companies for more of this type of innovating. It's the most basic principle of design: Form follows function. As the way we use our vehicles changes, so too will our vehicles themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The "V2" prefix is familiar shorthand to the connected car sector, referring to technology that links vehicles to various other properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These commonly center around over-the-air connections enabled by telematics technology. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) tech allows cars to "speak" to one another, which can mitigate the risk of collisions and establish safer, more efficient traffic patterns. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) enables cars to connect directly to systems like traffic lights or toll booths to ensure that they are safely and effectively navigating the roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that, someday, all relevant aspects of traffic will be communicating with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another V2 formulation, though, that deals with a different kind of connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V2G stands for vehicle-to-grid and refers to the the ability of electric or hybrid vehicles to interact with power grids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.acnnewswire.com/press-release/english/39115/" target="new"&gt;significant announcement&lt;/a&gt; was made in this space on October 19 when &lt;a href="http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/en/index.html" target="new"&gt;Mitsubishi Motors Corporation&lt;/a&gt; announced that it will be launching a pilot program in the Netherlands where Mitsubishi Outlander PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) would become compatible with two-way chargers that allowed vehicles to both charge from power grids and, when appropriate, send electricity back to those same grids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program will be established in partnership with European EV charging company &lt;a href="https://newmotion.com/en" target="new"&gt;NewMotion&lt;/a&gt;, Dutch grid operator &lt;a href="https://www.tennet.eu/?L=0" target="new"&gt;TenneT&lt;/a&gt; and V2G specialist &lt;a href="http://nuvve.com/" target="new"&gt;Nuvve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is a shift towards more and more renewable energy such as wind and solar, but both sources are still too dependent on the weather and therefore variable and volatile," NewMotion CEO Sytse Zuidema noted in a &lt;a href="https://newmotion.com/en/about-us/pressroom/newmotion-mitsubishi-motors-tennet-and-enel-implement-vehicle-to-grid-pilot-on-dutch-market" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "With V2G-technology, we turn parked electric vehicles--at home and at work--into power service providers and energy buffers. They can save a surplus of energy and return energy to the grid at a peak time. This results in more stability and security."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from a new kind of physical interaction, V2G has a number of similarities with V2V and V2I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that V2V helps cars automatically maintain appropriate distance between each other and V2I lets stoplights cater to the exact number of cars on the road, V2G establishes a form of communication between EVs and the power grid to distribute power in a way that maximizes utility for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Volatility increases with the growing electricity production from renewable sources. Supply and demand must always be in balance," TenneT CEO Mel Kroon wrote in the announcement. "Therefore, TenneT is looking for new decentralized sources to provide flexibility. This pilot project is part of a broader strategy and portfolio of pilots preparing the electricity system to accommodate the growing volume of renewable energy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its statement, Mitsubishi teased the idea of a "potential earnings model for electric drivers." How that might work remains unclear, but the idea that an electric vehicle owner could receive money for delivering stored power back to the electrical grid could be a big enticement toward converting owners of cars with internal combustion engines into owners of EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While this is just a pilot program for now, V2G is very promising, and could represent an entirely new way of thinking about electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of news about self-driving cars coming out of the US. Silicon Valley is considered a global hub of autonomous vehicle development. And each of the Big Three automakers is pouring enormous resources into the industry, with promising results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the regulatory front, many new bills and and regulations that would create a more welcoming environment for testing autonomous vehicles have been introduced at both the state and local level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the promise of autonomous vehicles and their ability to disrupt the way people get around is not limited to the US. Many global powers are developing their own AV technology and platforms that can compete right alongside those in the States. The UK, in particular, has been very active. And in mid-October, the country took a big step toward establishing a legal framework for self-driving cars with the release of The Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill. The legislation, which is currently making its way through parliament, could influence the way other countries in Europe adopt autonomous vehicle legislation. 

Here are the three major takeaways from &lt;a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2017-2019/0112/18112.pdf" target="new"&gt;the bill&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Insurers will be liable for accidents caused by AVs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has been some speculation over whether autonomous vehicle manufacturers could be liable for accidents involving their cars, but the bill puts the onus squarely on the shoulders of the insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Where an accident is caused by an automated vehicle when driving itself, the vehicle is insured at the time of the accident, and an insured person or any other person suffers damage as a result of the accident, the insurer is liable for that damage," according to the bill. The issue still remains, however, about how insurance companies will determine when and how they choose to insure self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Autonomous vehicle owners are responsible for software updates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736226" target="new" target="new"&gt;Over-the-air updates&lt;/a&gt; promise to help manufacturers keep their vehicles on the cutting edge of performance and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill states that the vehicle owner will be responsible for making sure those updates are deployed. Failure to do so could result in a consequence far more severe than neglecting to upgrade to the latest version of iOS. If an autonomous vehicle owner doesn't keep his or her car's software current, it could remove the obligation of an insurance company to pay claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill says, "An insurance policy in respect of an automated vehicle may exclude or limit the insurer's liability for ... a failure to install safety-critical software updates that the insured person knows, or ought reasonably to know, are safety-critical."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Gas stations may be have to become charging stations, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keeping in line with the common belief that autonomous vehicles will be electric vehicles, the bill also focuses on EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating from the understanding that in order for electric vehicles to be viable on a wide scale, access to charging points needs to be plentiful, the legislation leaves open the possibility that gas stations may have to devote a portion of their real estate to charging stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Regulations may impose requirements on large fuel retailers falling within a prescribed description, or service area operators falling within a prescribed description, in connection with the provision on their premises of public charging points," according to the bill.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The role that digital connectivity plays in our daily lives cannot be overstated. We have reached a point where we expect everything to be connected all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, automakers focused on improving the same factors of performance, safety and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connected car has transformed that list, adding an entirely new layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OEMs found that establishing the infrastructure necessary to offer viable connectivity services was an enormous task that they couldn't tackle on their own. It wasn't just an issue for automakers. Any manufacturer of Internet of Things (IoT) products, a group that is rapidly expanding each day, demands top-notch connectivity because even the tiniest glitches can wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable resources for identifying the enterprises that can deliver reliable machine-to-machine (M2M) and IoT connectivity is the Gartner Magic Quadrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magic Quadrant refers to a series of reports by tech research firm Gartner that offers analysis of important players in different IT subsector. In October, Gartner released its 2017 Magic Quadrants for Managed M2M Services, Worldwide, and prominently featured M2M provider &lt;a href="http://www.globetouch.com/" target="new"&gt;Globetouch&lt;/a&gt;. As Gartner writes, a big reason for Globetouch's success is the powerful partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Globetouch is a unique entity in the market because its current strength is the result of investments from a number of operators, or operator-affiliated holding companies, including: Verizon Ventures, CK Hutchison, Digicel, NTT Docomo, 263 China and Qihoo 360 Technology," the &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-4J1HDUK&amp;amp;ct=171023&amp;amp;st=sb" target="new"&gt;report says&lt;/a&gt;. "During this study, Globetouch announced winning a deal with OnStar (subsidiary of General Motors [GM]) for the expansion of the connected car service outside of the U.S. Globetouch also acquired Teramatrix Technologies, which develops an IoT sensor data analytics platform."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Gartner, those connections "provide operational scale to compete and beat many Tier 1 [communications service providers] in terms of operational scale." It also helps Globetouch live up to its name by operating effectively on a truly global scale. "Globetouch provides connectivity services in more than 180 countries, including local network services in 11 countries," reads the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globetouch has made connected cars one of its top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company estimates that by 2020, the average connected car could run through as much daily data as 2,666 combined Internet users. And with that data being used to ensure the safe operation of vehicles, it makes having stable vehicular connectivity services all the more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globetouch takes a 360-degree approach to the connected car ecosystem, recognizing that OEMs, consumers and service providers and fleet owners all have a &lt;a href="http://www.globetouch.com/industry-use-case-1/" target="new"&gt;role to play&lt;/a&gt; during the lifecycle of a connected vehicle. Globetouch's GStack is an innovative IoT/connected car stack that connects more than 800 network operations in over 180 countries under a single connectivity umbrella. This enables V2V and V2X communication, on-demand services, usage-based insurance, collision reporting, driver behavior, and ADAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As M2M and IoT services continue to become increasingly essential in the years to come, Globetouch is set to see its star shine even brighter. Its inclusion in Gartner's Magic Quadrant report is just the start of things to come.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Auto shows are a chance for automakers to invite consumers to dream with them. The most tangible manifestation of that is the concept cars companies reveal at the shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These vehicles are created less to take the road than they are to showcase an overarching concept or design direction that the automaker is moving toward. Over the years, there have been a ton of wild concepts, ranging from cars that fly, swim and transform. The idea of self-driving cars used to be one of these "out there" concepts, but as technology has advanced, autonomous vehicles have become a concept for today, not the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was against this backdrop that Nissan came to the Tokyo Motor Show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting in its home country, &lt;a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; faced high expectations to deliver a compelling, updated vision of Nissan Intelligent Mobility, its future-facing strategy for designing the automobile of tomorrow. And deliver it did. The Nissan IMx, a fully electric and fully autonomous concept car, was one of the biggest headline stealers of the entire show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The IMx zero-emission crossover concept vehicle embodies the future of Nissan Intelligent Mobility," Nissan executive vice president Daniele Schillaci in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-a184dd62301d125a56b7fc4e88035f81-nissan-unveils-imx-zero-emission-concept-at-tokyo-motor-show" target="new"&gt;noted in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Through Nissan Intelligent Mobility, Nissan is committed to changing the way people and cars communicate, as well as how cars interact with society in the near future and beyond."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Nissan revealed that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734192" target="new"&gt;bring its ProPilot technology&lt;/a&gt; stateside for the first time for the latest iteration of the electric Nissan Leaf. ProPilot Assist, as it's known in its current form, serves as an autonomous, single-lane highway driving system. But Nissan's long-term plans for ProPilot, as displayed in the IMx concept, go far beyond that base-level functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the core of the IMx's technological features is a future version of ProPilot that offers fully autonomous operation," writes Nissan. "When ProPilot drive mode is selected, the system stows the steering wheel inside the dashboard and reclines all seats, giving the driver more space and allowing the vehicle's occupants to relax and enjoy their commute. When manual drive mode is selected, the vehicle returns the steering wheel and seats to their original position, seamlessly transferring control back to the driver."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7VaRWZFz7c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video that Nissan released shows a driver/passenger taking a phone call that shows up on his vehicle's dashboard. The car is able to connect to surrounding vehicles in a demonstration of its V2V technology and then drops the person inside off at the airport before driving human-free to park itself. And that is when things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The IMx can park itself in a spot where the vehicle can connect to the local power grid and act as a 'virtual' power plant by returning electricity to the grid, an extension of its vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-building features," according to Nissan. "Once the owner returns, the IMx can pick them up at the terminal and drive home."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissan is already beginning to test vehicle-to-grid technology &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40476527/these-new-electric-cars-will-pay-for-their-charging-by-selling-energy-back-to-the-grid" target="new"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some of the capabilities that automakers teased at auto shows in decades past start to come online, it will be interesting to see what kind of moonshots future concept cars try to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Of all the individual components that power a self-driving car -- and there are many -- Lidar sensors may be the single most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a sensor that sends out millions of laser pulses every second. The pulses bounce off of surrounding objects and return to the sensor, giving a vehicle accurate measurements of how far away it is from those objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That data can then be used to create a virtual, three-dimensional map of an autonomous vehicle's immediate surroundings, allowing it to navigate the road safely and respond quickly to changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar was once known for its coffee can-shaped housing device, but has taken a variety of different shapes in recent years. Along with this changing form has come improved function: The Lidar systems on the market offer increased range and clarity with each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having affordable, high-performing Lidar has long been an imperative for self-driving car designers, but it becomes even more essential as these outfits start scaling up the production of autonomous vehicles in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that they have access to high quality Lidar, OEMs have taken to acquiring Lidar companies and bringing their operations in house. The latest of these acquisitions took place in late October, when Ford's autonomous subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.argo.ai/" target="new"&gt;Argo AI&lt;/a&gt; announced that it had purchased the New Jersey Lidar firm &lt;a href="https://www.princetonlightwave.com/" target="new"&gt;Princeton Lightwave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With the addition of the Princeton Lightwave team, Argo is uniquely positioned to innovate in both sensor hardware and the interface between sensor and software -- enabling us to achieve performance improvements that would not otherwise be possible," Argo CEO Bryan Salesky wrote in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/how-acquiring-a-team-of-lidar-experts-strengthens-our-self-driving-future-8ef340603563" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the acquisition. "Princeton Lightwave's technology will help us unlock new capabilities that will aid our virtual driver system in handling object detection in challenging scenarios, such as poor weather conditions, and safely operating at high speeds in dynamic environments."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Princeton Lightwave has a Lidar product that performs at the level that many believe will be necessary for self-driving cars to properly perform at high speed on freeways. Its &lt;a href="https://www.princetonlightwave.com/products/geigercruizer/" target="new"&gt;GeigerCruizer Lidar&lt;/a&gt; can detect objects more than 300 meters away and can still operate in snow and foggy conditions as well as when water or dirt lands on the Lidar's window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argo AI isn't the first company to make a splash with a key Lidar acquisition in recent weeks. Earlier in October, GM's Cruise Automation &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737289" target="new"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; Lidar startup Strobe, and Delphi Automotive forged a &lt;a href="http://investor.delphi.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Delphi-Partners-with-LeddarTech-to-Provide-LiDAR-for-Autonomous-Vehicles/default.aspx" target="new"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Lidar company LeddarTech. It's also not Ford's first time pouring money into a Lidar company. Ford invested $75 million into Velodyne, perhaps the best-known Lidar manufacturer, in August of last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Argo, it's work is far from done. But with Princeton Lightwave in the fold, the company has brought in a team that will turbocharge its Lidar work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Even considering how far we've come in bringing about a world of self-driving cars, there's still much we need to accomplish," Salesky writes. "We have to continue making improvements through dedicated research and development that's aligned with our overall hardware and software strategy."&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The year 2017 brought hundreds of stories about self-driving cars, nearly all of them positive and encouraging. But one of the biggest AV stories of the year has been a dragged out and ugly one: Waymo's ongoing lawsuit against Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case stems from &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; Co-Founder Anthony Levandowski leaving the company in January 2016. Levandowski left to start the self-driving truck company Otto. Only six months later, Otto was acquired by &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, which was looking to kick-start its own self-driving efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo's lawsuit alleges that Levandowski illegally downloaded 14,000 files about the company's &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;Lidar&lt;/a&gt; sensor technology when he left, and brought that information to Otto and then to Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, the proceedings took a turn that could prove to be a serious blow to Uber. The US Justice Department notified Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the Waymo-Uber lawsuit, of a letter written by the attorney of former Uber Security Analyst Richard Jacobs. In the letter, Jacobs lays out a series of disturbing business practices that allegedly took place at Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter was originally sent to Uber this past spring but was not presented during the lawsuit's discovery process, meaning jurors could be told that Uber withheld evidence in the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Uber improperly withheld the Jacobs Letter, which exposes the extreme lengths it was willing to go both to get a leg up on competition and hide evidence of bad acts," a &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/16/technology/uber-jacobs-letter/index.html" target="new"&gt;Waymo spokesperson wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. "Separate and apart from the letter, Waymo has accumulated significant evidence that Uber is using stolen Waymo trade secrets, including copying aspects of Waymo's Lidar designs down to the micron, and we look forward to trial."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it remains to be seen how the alleged mishandling of Jacobs's letter will affect Uber in the trial, it's wholly possible that the contents of the letter will have far greater ramifications outside of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Jacobs describes sounds like a company run by a Hollywood version of a corporate villain. Among other things, Jacobs alleges that Uber performed espionage against foreign countries, bribed foreign government officials, destroyed and falsified records and documents, spied on competing companies, and stole trade secrets from competitors. That last accusation is exactly the subject of Waymo's lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement regarding Jacobs's letter, Uber did not exactly make a strong denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While we haven't substantiated all the claims in this letter -- and, importantly, any related to Waymo -- our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology," &lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/12/15/16782534/alphabet-waymo-uber-self-driving-lawsuit-jacobs-letter-surveillance" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; a spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter scandal is a fitting end to a disastrous 2017 for Uber. In February, a &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/02/03/uber-lyft-delete-donald-trump-executive-order/" target="new"&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of President Trump's immigration ban caused over 200,000 customers to delete the Uber app. Various other scandals, including a series of reports about Uber's toxic and sexist corporate culture, forced CEO Travis Kalanick to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns" target="new"&gt;resign&lt;/a&gt; in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Uber has endured scandal after scandal, it has provided a boost to competitors. It has given a particular lift to Lyft. And given how quickly the automotive world is changing, there's no telling how far Uber might fall if it loses the Waymo lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Even before self-driving cars first took to the road, a popular thought experiment circulated about how the autonomous vehicles would be insured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto insurance is based largely on assigning blame to a driver in the event of an accident. Driverless cars throw a serious wrench in that model since there really isn't a driver, at least not a human one, to assign blame to. So if a driverless car were deemed responsible for an accident, who would be liable: the owner, the manufacturer or both?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is further complicated by the fact that most forecasts predict that autonomous vehicles will, at least at the outset, not be owned by individuals.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most driverless car usage is expected to take place through ride-sharing and ride-hailing services. This creates new questions around insurance for self-driving fleets, and how passengers will be protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; took an initial step toward answering those questions when it announced that on-demand insurance provider &lt;a href="https://www.trov.com/" target="new"&gt;Trov&lt;/a&gt; would provide insurance for Waymo's forthcoming autonomous ride-hailing service, which will debut in the Phoenix metro area this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insurer's On-Demand Insurance platform will enable passengers of Waymo's service to acquire protections for medical expenses, trip interruptions and lost property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Innovative technology needs innovative partners," Waymo Director of Operations Shaun Stewart noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trov-and-waymo-partner-to-launch-insurance-for-ride-hailing-300573229.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Trov is pioneering a cutting-edge approach to insurance that's ideal for ride-sharing because it's customized for every trip. As we prepare to launch a commercial service, we're thrilled to collaborate with Trov to unlock the full potential of shared mobility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trov's unique insurance model eschews the blanket policies typically offered by insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Trov allows customers to turn protection on or off at any time with the touch of an in-app button.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That innovative feature will extend to its Waymo arrangement. Passengers will be able to choose whether or not they want to insure, say, their laptop or cell phone for a given ride. One imagines that more fundamental medical protections won't be optional, and will probably be baked into the price of a ride. (Being charged an extra $5 for medical insurance every time one hails a ride seems like a bad customer experience in several ways.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target"new"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; its autonomous pilot program in November, becoming the first company to launch an AV service for customers without a human operator in the car. Waymo's announcement promised that participants in this early program will have access to the autonomous fleets for commutes to work, children's rides to school or as a designated driver after a night out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2012, Trov immediately found a market for its revolutionary pick-and-choose insurance offerings, especially among younger consumers. Trov closed a $45 million round of Series D funding led by German reinsurance company Munich Re in April, and a Munich Re affiliate that will underwrite Trov's Waymo coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Trov is providing new avenues for developing markets like shared mobility, and this latest partnership exemplifies how their on-demand platform can be adapted for use in a variety of applications," Munich Re Digital Partners CEO Andy Rear wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;No brand is more associated with Lidar than Velodyne. In a self-driving car sector that lacks widespread industry standards, Velodyne Lidar sensors are one of the few pieces of hardware that are used by just about everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar sensors, which emit millions of laser pulses per second to build a virtual rendering of a physical environment, have been in use since the early 1960s. However, at the 2005 &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738354" target="new"&gt;DARPA Grand Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt; Founder and CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737882" target="new"&gt;David Hall&lt;/a&gt; unveiled a major innovation by using a rotating Lidar device to help guide the autonomous system of a driverless car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the rotating Lidar mechanism was replicated by a number of AV developers in the following years, Velodyne has remained the industry leader for vehicular Lidar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of its position and scale, when Velodyne makes an announcement people take notice. And Velodyne entered 2018 with a bang. On New Year's Day, the company revealed that it was halving the price of its VLP-16 sensor, its most popular Lidar system. Released in 2016 at a $8,000 price point, the VLP-16 will now cost $4,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Demand for our VLP-16s grew tremendously in 2017. As a result, we increased capacity and now can pass along savings as cost reduction to our customers," Hall wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180101005041/en/Velodyne-Slashes-Price-Popular-LiDAR-Sensor" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We want to make 2018 a year of optimism for the autonomous vehicle, especially as the first waves of robocabs hit the road. Our goal is the democratization of transportation safety by making it accessible to every man, woman, and child in the world as quickly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its name indicates, the VLP-16 is a 16-channel Lidar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means it offers lower resolution and a lower level of performance than sensors with a greater number of channels, including Velodyne's own Ultra Puck VLP-32C, the HDL-64E, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738731" target="new"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; VLS-128. But, as Steve LeVine points out at &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/velodyne-has-halved-the-price-of-its-popular-self-driving-sensor-2521676329.html" target="new"&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt;, AV designers ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737637" target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; to robotaxi company &lt;a href="http://zoox.com/" target="new"&gt;Zoox&lt;/a&gt; have outfitted functional driverless prototypes with several VLP-16s to mimic the functionality of a smaller number of higher-end sensors. At its new price point, the VLP-16 becomes even more attractive option for companies in the early stages of autonomous vehicle testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price reduction was enabled by the recent commencement of operations at Velodyne's new "Megafactory" in San Jose, a manufacturing facility that has made production more efficient, according to Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since its launch, customers have been lining up to purchase the VLP-16 and we've been able to meet that growing demand by expanding production and developing automated manufacturing for Lidar sensors at the Megafactory," he said. "With this cost reduction, we'll be able to get more Pucks into the hands of more customers, support the growing number of autonomous vehicle development fleets around the world, and start creating a better tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Velodyne's market position, it faces no shortage of competition in the emerging market from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.ouster.io/" target="new"&gt;Ouster&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739058" target="new"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; a 64-channel Lidar that is smaller, lighter and more efficient than Velodyne's 64-channel offering -- and six times less expensive. But with the release of the VLS-128, Velodyne further solidified its position at the top of the market. Now, by slashing prices on the VLP-16, it is ensuring that its products stay competitive in terms of price as well as performance.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the single greatest triumph of the connected car is location-based security services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the GPS and telematics products that are commonly available for most new cars, car owners are able to track the location of their vehicle from cell phone apps. A would-be burglar driving what is effectively a moving tracking device will be caught in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These capabilities now extend to the sharing economy, with car rental company &lt;a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/" target="new"&gt;SnappCar&lt;/a&gt; saying it would allow car owners to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739273" target="new"&gt;track their vehicles&lt;/a&gt; when they're rented it out to a user of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And vehicle security is about to take another significant step forward. At this year's CES trade show, &lt;a href="http://www.gentex.com/" target="new"&gt;Gentex&lt;/a&gt; is prepared to reveal a slate of new technology, one of which seems straight out of Minority Report: in-vehicle retina scans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The driver's eyes are key to securing and customizing the in-vehicle, connected-car experience," Gentex CEO Steve Downing wrote in a &lt;a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/gentex-to-demonstrate-new-connected-car-biometrics-and-digital-rear-vision-technologies-at-ces-2018-20180102-00463" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "By knowing exactly who is behind the wheel, automakers can implement vehicle security, personalize the vehicle cabin, and secure access to cloud-based accounts, apps, and additional connected car services."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Downing notes, the security advantages of this type of driver identification go beyond merely ensuring that authorized users are operating a vehicle. It can provide an additional layer of security for payment services at toll booths and gas stations. Its uses even extend into infotainment: Upon identifying a driver via a retinal scan, a connected car system could automatically implement their preferred settings for seat positioning, cabin temperature and music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanism that will trigger the retinal scan in equipped cars is slick. Once in the car, all a driver needs to do is look into the rearview mirror. Their presence will be detected, and the system will commence the scan that uses near-infrared emitters and an iris-scanning camera as hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retina scanning is only one of the new features that Gentex plans to reveal at CES. HomeLink Connect is an app that allows drivers in to control radio-frequency devices like garage doors from their car. It can even allow them to control IoT devices like connected thermostats, lighting and security systems, all from the comfort of a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By adding cloud-based wireless control to HomeLink's traditional [radio frequency] functionality, the feature stands to remain the industry's most versatile, reliable, and comprehensive in-vehicle home automation system," Downing noted. "It also opens the feature to new markets and new users by providing an ever-expanding number of use cases."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As the global market for self-driving cars matures over the next decade-plus, China represents an enormous business opportunity for autonomous vehicle developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the world's largest population and a relatively recent explosion in automobile ownership and usage, the Chinese market is expected to be the largest single global market for driverless cars for the foreseeable future. A &lt;a href="http://news.ihsmarkit.com/press-release/automotive/autonomous-vehicle-sales-surpass-33-million-annually-2040-enabling-new-auto" target="new"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt; from IHS Markit predicted that China will account for 14.5 million of the 33 million autonomous vehicle sales in the year 2040, nearly twice as much as the next closest country. And China's &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739301" target="new"&gt;recent move&lt;/a&gt; to allow the testing of self-driving cars on public roads suggests an eagerness to accelerate the development and implementation of these vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those reasons, &lt;a href="https://us.blackberry.com/" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; recently became the envy of the autonomous driving world when it announced a large-scale partnership with tech giant &lt;a href="http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=188488&amp;amp;p=irol-irhome" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate on various components of the Chinese company's driverless car projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the several initiatives on which the companies will work together, the foremost will be BlackBerry contributing its QNX operating system as a foundation for Baidu's Apollo open autonomous driving platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"BlackBerry QNX has established itself as the OS platform for safety-certified production-based systems," Li Zhenyu, general manager of Baidu's Intelligent Driving Group, noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/blackberry-baidu-partnering-accelerate-connected-autonomous-vehicle-technology-nyse-bb-2244030.htm" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We aim to provide automakers with a clear and fast path to fully autonomous vehicle production, with safety and security as top priorities. By integrating the BlackBerry QNX OS with the Apollo platform, we will enable carmakers to leap from prototype to production systems. Together, we will work toward a technological and commercial ecosystem for autonomous driving, intelligent connectivity, and intelligent traffic systems."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apollo is perhaps the world's best-known autonomous driving platform, partly because it is open-source and has drawn contributors ranging from independent developers to the most prominent tech companies and automakers in the driverless car space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu frequently makes a point to tout its long list of collaborators, which include companies like Ford, Velodyne and Intel. Baidu &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734772" target="new"&gt;works with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, incorporating its Azure platform to power Apollo's cloud computing elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baidu connected car smartphone integration system CarLife and conversational AI system DuerOS will also both be incorporated into the BlackBerry QNX infotainment platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Joining forces with Baidu will enable us to explore integration opportunities for multiple vehicle subsystems including ADAS, infotainment, gateways, and cloud services," said BlackBerry Senior Vice President John Wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While BlackBerry may best be known by the average American consumer for its cellular devices that dominated the early smartphone market, the Canadian company has since become a major player in cybersecurity and telematics, particularly with regards to connected and driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-baidu/blackberry-surges-on-deal-with-baidu-for-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1ES15V" target="new"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, this partnership with Baidu represents one of BlackBerry's biggest moves in recent years, and the company's stock rose to its highest close since March 2013 in the wake of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In many ways the march toward driverless cars is in lockstep with the march toward improved Lidar sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry leader, &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt; -- the same company that &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737882" target="new"&gt;pioneered&lt;/a&gt; Lidar in autonomous vehicles -- continues to raise the bar. The company recently unveiled a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738731" target="new"&gt;new sensor&lt;/a&gt; with 128 laser channels and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739387" target="new"&gt;halved the price&lt;/a&gt; for its most popular sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are plenty of other outfits out there trying to chase Velodyne down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar startup &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739058" target ="new"&gt;Ouster&lt;/a&gt; recently emerged from stealth mode with $27 million in funding and a high-performance sensor that it touts as lightweight and affordable. &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739131" target="new"&gt;TetraVue&lt;/a&gt; raised $10 million earlier this year on the strength of its flash Lidar, which the company believes outperforms traditional Lidar. Even &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738551" target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has been looking for ways to optimize the technology's performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges to Velodyne's Lidar supremacy is &lt;a href="https://innoviz.tech/" target="new"&gt;Innoviz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2016, the Israeli company quickly rose to prominence with solid-state Lidar offerings known for performance, reliability and affordability. After &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/innoviz-technologies-announces-after-market-lidar-solution-innovizpro-collaborates-with-jabil-on-development-and-deployment-300462173.html" target="new"&gt;an initial announcement&lt;/a&gt; in May of last year, Innoviz recently released its long-awaited InnovizPro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state Lidar is widely viewed as the future of the sensor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating all of the Lidar functionality into a single microchip eliminates the mechanical parts which are prone to failure. Since one of the biggest concerns with all Lidar sensors is their price, autonomous vehicle developers aren't going to want to invest in one that could break down faster. By creating a reliable solid-state sensor and cutting the cost, Innoviz co-founder and CEO Omar Keilaf believes he has a solution the market will love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"InnovizPro provides immediate accessibility to our advanced Lidar technology and marks a giant leap forward for the entire autonomous vehicle market," Keilaf noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.oemoffhighway.com/electronics/sensors/press-release/20987677/innoviz-technologies-innoviz-technologies-launches-innovizpro-highresolution-solidstate-lidar-solution" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We are addressing a major need for high-resolution scanning technology at lower cost, with no minimum order required."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, it was announced that the InnovizPro had received the CES 2018 Innovation Award for Vehicle Intelligence and Self-Driving Technology. The company accepted the award in Las Vegas at CES 2018 in January. According &lt;a href="https://ces18.mapyourshow.com/7_0/exhibitor/exhibitor-details.cfm?ExhID=T0008010" target="new"&gt;to CES&lt;/a&gt;, InnovizPro's honor means it met "the highest standards for outstanding product design and engineering as judged by a panel of highly respected experts in their field."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award comes on the heels of news that &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delphi-partners-with-innoviz-technologies-to-provide-high-performance-lidar-solutions-for-autonomous-vehicles-300506535.html" target="new"&gt;Aptiv&lt;/a&gt; (previously Delphi Automotive) and &lt;a href="http://www.eenewsanalog.com/news/magna-joins-delphi-backing-innoviz-0" target="new"&gt;Magna International&lt;/a&gt; had established separate partnerships to utilize Innoviz's sensor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, Innoviz closed a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/innoviz-technologies-extends-series-b-funding-to-73-million-300546221.html" target="new"&gt;$73 million&lt;/a&gt; Series B funding round that included major contributions from Aptiv and Magna.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Nvidia and automotive technology specialist Continental have teamed up to build an advanced self-driving vehicle systems based on the chipmaker's Xavier Drive platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaboration will result in an artificial intelligence (AI) system that will offer support for autonomous vehicles spanning in complexity from Level 2 -- basic driver assistance features -- to Level 5, where the vehicle has no steering wheel or pedals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies will focus initially on highly automated driving features, and 360-degree perception and automatic lane changing on highways, including the ability to merge in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system will also integrate high-definition maps and provide updates that will enable vehicles to localize themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drive platform includes the Xavier system-on-a-chip (SoC), as well as the Nvidia's Drive operating system and Drive AV (autonomous vehicle) software stacks.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Nvidia technologies will then integrate a range of Continental sensors, including radar, camera and high-resolution 3D Lidar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continental also specializes in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), integrating multi-function cameras, fish-eye cameras with surround view and central control units for assisted and automated driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Partnering with Nvidia will enable Continental to advance beyond its leadership position in advanced driver assistance systems, delivering a scalable range of automated and autonomous vehicle systems, from today's requirements up to Level 5," Luca De Ambroggi, an analyst with IHS Markit, wrote in a February 5 statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planned market introduction in 2021 aligns with German luxury automaker BMW's plans to introduce fully self-driving cars to the market that same year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The complexity of autonomous driving requires nothing less than the full computational horsepower of an AI supercomputer," Dr. Elmar Degenhart, CEO of Continental, &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/continental-and-nvidia-partner-to-enable-worldwide-production-of-ai-self-driving-cars"target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. "Together with the performance and flexibility of Nvidia's AI self-driving solution, from the cloud to the car we will achieve new levels of safety, comfort and personalization for future vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xavier is also key part of the Drive Pegasus AI computing platform, a supercomputer that is the size of a license plate, and is designed for fully autonomous &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/01/25/whats-difference-level-2-level-5-autonomy/"target="new"&gt;Level 5&lt;/a&gt; robotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia's Drive Xavier autonomous machine processors power the Drive software stack, which the company has expanded to a trio of AI platforms covering each aspect of next-generation cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than 9 billion transistors, Xavier is built around a custom 8-core CPU, a new 512-core Volta graphics processing unit (GPU), a new deep learning accelerator, new computer vision accelerators and new 8K HDR video processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We now have all the key elements in place to take AI self-driving cars from development to mass production," Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia was part of a Mercedes-Benz PR event in Amsterdam &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/02/02/mercedes-benz-a-class-mbux-ai-graphics/"target="new"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; when the 2019 A-Class was unveiled in the Noord district on the city's waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new A-Class cars are the first to offer the Mercedes-Benz User Experience -- or MBUX -- infotainment system, which uses Nvidia technology for its natural language processing and augmented reality-enhanced navigation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional computational capabilities are in reserve, enabling new applications to be deployed over the life of the vehicle, and the car was designed as a learning system, anticipating user preferences the longer the system is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The world's premier electric car company -- Tesla -- is getting in on the trend for cross-country automated vehicle adventures, following coast-to-coast excursions by commercial trucks and passenger cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a fourth-quarter earnings call on February 7, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla was planning to embark on a road trip across the US in a self-driving car within three to six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company had previously announced plans for a coast-to-coast autonomous trek last year with a planned drive from Los Angeles to New York in a self-driving Model S or Model X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The upcoming autonomous coast-to-coast drive will showcase a major leap forward for our self-driving technology," Musk wrote in a &lt;a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/5975320007x0x970775/34923C55-6853-4223-ADDA-CB3CDC1B919F/TSLA_Update_Letter_2017-4Q.pdf"target="new"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;. "Additionally, an extensive overhaul of the underlying architecture of our software has now been completed, which has enabled a step-change improvement in the collection and analysis of data and fundamentally enhanced its machine-learning capabilities."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk also noted in the letter that the company's neural network, which expands as Tesla's customer fleet grows, is able to collect and analyze more high-quality data than ever before, which will allow the company to rollout a series of new Autopilot features in 2018 and in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Embark Technology, a startup developing self-driving trucks, announced it had completed a coast-to-coast, 2,400-mile journey from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Fla. test drive with a semi-autonomous truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cross-country trek, part of a three-way partnership with the truck-leasing company Ryder and the appliance giant Electrolux, took five days, which the company said it thinks it could get down to two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla, which has produced multiple models of electric vehicles for consumers, first announced plans to develop electric trucks in 2016, and Reuters &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-truck-autonomous/exclusive-tesla-developing-self-driving-tech-for-semi-truck-wants-to-test-in-nevada-idUSKBN1AP2GD"target="new"&gt;recently obtained&lt;/a&gt; a document showing correspondence between Tesla and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles discussing road tests for a prototype long-haul autonomous vehicle truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, automotive technology specialist Delphi's autonomous Audi arrived in New York City, nine days, 15 states, and 3,400 miles after leaving San Francisco -- company officials said the vehicle was in fully automated mode for 99% of the drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the world, Nissan &lt;a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-2f7966f516e271fc4ea0f79a9a005a1a-171205-01-e/"target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to have its fully automated ride service on the road in Japan by the early 2020s -- the plan is to start with a "public field test" for the Easy Ride service in Yokohama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public field test will take place in the Minatomirai district of Yokohama from March 5 to March 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the public advances of advanced drive assisted driving (ADAS) systems and the high-profile cross-country self-driving vehicle trials, some in the industry are skeptical as to how soon fully autonomous vehicles are a common presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at this week's Nissan Futures technology symposium in Singapore, Niels De Boer, program director at the Centre of Excellence For Testing and Research of Autonomous Vehicles at Nanyang Technological University, told Motoring that companies need to be "realistic" about their timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You make bold statements, but you really need to ask what do you mean by autonomous driving?" he &lt;a href="https://www.motoring.com.au/autonomous-cars-decades-away-says-nissan-110983/"target="new"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;. "Because a lot of these statements are made but they dont talk about the level of maturity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Boer said he doesn't think widespread use of fully autonomous vehicle networks for another half century.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Following a week of courtroom testimony that laid bare the sometimes cutthroat process of bringing driverless vehicles to the world's roadways, Waymo and Uber announced a stunning settlement of their patent dispute on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Waymo, which is the autonomous car division that Google spun out several years ago, agreed to settle its dispute against the ride-sharing giant in exchange for a $245 million stake in Uber, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/09/uber-waymo-lawsuit-settlement.html"target="new"&gt;according to several media reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal, which both companies announced February 9 inside the courtroom of Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco, means that Waymo now owns a 0.34% stake in Uber, which is valued at about $72 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/stunner-google-and-uber-settle-1518191623-21a40f85-0a9c-400c-99b6-67282eebd75d.html"target="new"&gt;according to Axios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber also pledged not to incorporate any of Waymo's trade secrets into its own plans to build fleets of autonomous cars for its ride-sharing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the dispute between the two companies was the fate of former &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740419&amp;"target="new"&gt;Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski&lt;/a&gt;, who was seen as instrumental in developing the Lidar systems that would help these autonomous vehicles maneuver through city streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Waymo, Levandowski founded the company Otto, which was then bought by Uber. Waymo, and its parent company Alphabet, charged that Uber only bought the company to gain access to Levandowski and his knowledge of Lidar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Waymo said the former employee downloaded thousands of files before he left, and that intellectual property belonged to the company, not him personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo originally sought $1.8 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week of the trial saw testimony by several luminaries from Silicon Valley, including Uber founder Travis Kalanick, who was leading the company when the dispute began. The testimony also showed how brutal the behind-the-scenes race has become to move self-driving out of the test phase and into the commercial world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That curtain closed on Friday, when Uber and Waymo announced their agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-waymo-settlement/"target="new"&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt;, current Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi noted that the company could have handled the Otto acquisition better, but that the agreement would mean Waymo and Uber would be partners and competitors going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To be clear, while we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymo's proprietary information in its self-driving technology, we are taking steps with Waymo to ensure our Lidar and software represents just our good work," Khosrowshahi wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Waymo statement struck a similar tone, according to Axios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have always believed competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads and we look forward to bringing fully self-driving cars to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles are going to get presidential treatment in Washington DC as the city's mayor is paving the way to embrace these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, February 12, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a new agency that will help prepare the city, its residents as well as the streets, for autonomous vehicle testing and other developments. The Interagency AV Working Group is made up of representatives from other city agencies that focus on transportation, disability rights, environmental issues and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency's first task is to create a proposal to test autonomous and self-driving vehicles on 10th Street, SW, near the L'Enfant Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We will keep the District on the cutting edge of autonomous vehicles and do so in a way that benefits our residents," said Mayor Bowser in a &lt;a href="https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-establishes-autonomous-vehicle-working-group"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Washington, DC is a creative, tech-savvy city, and as we grow, we will always be exploring and investing in innovation and finding ways to make it more inclusive."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new agency is also working with the city's Southwest Business Improvement District, which works to improve and maintain about 483 acres within the southwest part of Washington, &lt;a href="https://www.swbid.org/"target="new"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the city's proposal is accepted, the autonomous vehicle program would run along 10th Street, which connects the National Mall via Independence Avenue and Banneker Park to The Wharf, according to the mayor's office. The street sits above Interstate 395 and about 4,300 cars travel it each day, which would be enough to test autonomous vehicles in real-life traffic situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in this process is a Request for Information (RFI), which asks for information and input from autonomous vehicle providers and other technology companies. &lt;a href="https://www.swbid.org/avrfi"target="new"&gt;The RFI also offers a look&lt;/a&gt; at where proposed testing route is located. 

&lt;p&gt;Washington's elected officials began exploring autonomous vehicle technology in 2017, and Bowser recently traveled to Silicon Valley to pitch the city as a test area for the technology. If approved, it would make the District one of the few Northeast cities testing autonomous technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, most self-driving and autonomous vehicle testing is conducted in the Western US, in Nevada, Arizona and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=739968"target="new"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, which is near where these technologies are being developed in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. However, other metropolises are starting to jump into the game, notably Pittsburgh, which is home to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740108"target="new"&gt;Uber's self-driving development team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Even if truly self-driving cars were available now, most drivers aren't ready to give up the wheel, according to an Esurance online survey of 1,057 vehicle owners in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.esurance.com/insights/technology-and-distracted-driving"target="new"&gt;The report&lt;/a&gt;, released February 14, found only 17% of surveyed drivers would sacrifice driving control to safely multi-task on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nearly half -- 46% -- of drivers with in-car tech features say it helps their driving, 10% believe the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a quarter of respondents who sought out tech in their new vehicles reported that they have since deactivated at least one feature, and potentially helpful features like GPS navigation systems were a leading cause of driver distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an indicator that advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) might be proving more distracting than helpful, drivers with in-car tech seemed to be slightly more distracted than those without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey found 29% of drivers admit that the warning sounds themselves -- such as when the car drifts into another lane -- can be distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey also indicated that while most drivers recognize that using technology such as smartphones and GPS is distracting behind the wheel, they're willing to do it anyway. This is despite the admission by 10% of respondents that they have personally experienced a close call or accident caused by their own distracted driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Despite the fact that fatalities related to distracted driving are on the rise, this survey tells us that drivers are willing to take the risk and continue to give into the lure of using technology while driving," Stephanie Braun, director of connected cars at Esurance, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-car-technology-is-making-drivers-more-distracted-finds-esurance-300598540.html/"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly six in ten -- 58% -- of drivers surveyed admitted to some level of distracted driving, whether that's texting or navigating while driving, with basic tech like mobile devices as the leading cause of their distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech distractions were followed by distractions from other drivers -- 30% -- and personal distractions like interacting with other passengers and eating -- 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority -- 91% -- of surveyed drivers said that they believe texting while driving is distracting, though more than half of those surveyed said they do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing more automakers try to address the issue of distracted driving through semi-autonomous features, but we're also mindful of the fact that some of these features could distract drivers even more and often give drivers a false sense of security," Braun added in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly a third -- 30% -- of respondents said they know someone who has experienced a distracted driving accident or close call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey also found 30% of drivers admitted to giving in to distractions when they're too busy or are multi-tasking, and a quarter of respondents said they would pick up their phone simply because they're bored while driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey categorized drivers with car tech as owners of vehicles with warning systems such as a blind spot monitor, lane departure warning, collision warning or driver override features like lane keep, automatic emergency braking or adaptive cruise control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, 15 interviews were conducted in December with owners of high-tech vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen Group will include WLANp -- a wireless system to link cars to each other and roadside infrastructure -- in all its cars in Europe beginning next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision, &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/detailpage/-/detail/Volkswagen-Group-assumes-pioneering-role-in-rapid-road-safety-improvement/view/6248913/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da?p_p_auth=JV3jM91i" target="new"&gt;announced on February 15&lt;/a&gt;, might help to establish wireless LANs, rather than cellular networks, as the standard mechanism for so-called V2X, or vehicle-to-everything, communication. Automakers and regulators are weighing the two alternatives for V2X, which is expected to improve safety and traffic flow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VW will provide WLANp as standard equipment at no extra cost on all its personal and commercial vehicles. It says the move will help create a broad network of information on traffic risks and promote accident-free driving. Volkswagen Group is one of the largest automakers in the world, with &lt;a href="http://www.dw.com/en/volkswagen-group-achieves-record-sales-in-2017/a-42177892" target="new"&gt;2017 sales&lt;/a&gt; of 10.7 million vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V2X can help cars "see" each other even where buildings or other vehicles block the view, including around corners and in highway passing situations. It has a range of hundreds of meters and can reach farther than the radar and Lidar systems being built into driverless cars. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;If one car is about to run a red light and another is nearing the intersection at a blind corner, V2X in both cars could generate an alert -- or make either car stop, depending on how much automation was built into the cars. It could also send a signal from one car to the vehicles behind it when the brakes are applied so they can automatically slow down or generate a driver alert. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V2X links could also help vehicles see pedestrians with mobile devices and communicate with infrastructure like traffic lights and warning signs. Wirelessly linked trucks could form convoys that roam the highways together to run more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Think speed control to maintain a safe distance, not drivers conspiring over &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy_(song)" target="new"&gt;CB radio&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while regulators and industry generally agree on the potential for V2X, there's less harmony over what system to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WLANp is based on IEEE 802.11p, part of the standard behind WiFi. Its proponents say the technology is tested and ready to go. Regulators in both the US and Europe have used it in developing standards for future cars and infrastructure and have set aside similar frequencies for the radios to use. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has proposed requiring an 802.11p-based system called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) in all US vehicles. All these steps could help clear the way for wireless LANs to show up in all new vehicles and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But recently, some major automotive tech suppliers have started to say cellular, or C-V2X, may be the best, fastest, and most secure way to go. Cell-based systems, especially with upcoming 5G capabilities, could work better than wireless LANs and ride the massive wave of cell-chip manufacturing to low cost and wide availability, they say. &lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm, which &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/qualcomm-steadfast-supporter-dsrc-sees-c-v2x-providing-clear-path-forward" target="new"&gt;already makes&lt;/a&gt; 802.11p chips, is &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/technologies/lte/advanced-pro/cellular-v2x" target="new"&gt;promoting&lt;/a&gt; C-V2X as a technology for both communication between cars (on those dedicated frequencies) and links to cellular networks. The 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), which includes Audi, BMW, Daimler and the biggest cell network suppliers, plus Qualcomm and Intel, is also pushing for this approach. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Waymo has won permission from Arizona to turn its futuristic self-driving taxi experiment in Phoenix into a commercial service.&lt;/p&gt; 

With a &lt;a href="https://www.azdot.gov/docs/default-source/motor-vehicle-services/vehicle-for-hire/vfh-valid-permits-tnc.pdf?sfvrsn=46" target="new"&gt;vehicle-for-hire permit&lt;/a&gt; in hand, the autonomous car division of Google parent company Alphabet is one step closer to launching the service it's been trying out around Phoenix for several months. Arizona issued the permit on January 24, according to &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1208897/alphabets-waymo-googl-is-readying-a-ride-hailing-service-in-arizona-that-could-directly-compete-with-uber/" target="new"&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo says it plans to launch the service this year and has &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740141" target="new"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; "thousands" of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans for its fleet. It's testing the technology in five states and has been offering free rides in a trial program in Phoenix since early last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last November, Waymo sent minivans out without safety drivers to take over if the vehicle made a mistake. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The upcoming service will put the Google juggernaut into the ride-hailing business against Uber and Lyft, and with a game-changing technology advantage that neither rival has developed quite to the point Waymo has reached. Robotic taxis without drivers could slash the cost of rides for consumers and dramatically increase the scale of ride-hailing services -- if local, state and federal laws allow it and there are no collisions that raise safety alarms with the public and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740639&amp;" target="new"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; last week that self-driving cars would reduce the cost of the average ride from $2.50 per mile to $1 per mile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of Google muscling its way into the industry led Uber to hire some of Google's top automotive engineers in 2016, making the acquisition that led to Waymo and Uber's recent court battle that was &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740475" target="new"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. In 2013, the two companies had formed a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740419" target="new"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; to combine Google's cars with Uber's ride-hailing platform, but that deal died of Google's neglect, according to Uber founder Travis Kalanick. &lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Still, the race among the three companies is more complex than a pure rivalry. Google Ventures invested more than $250 million in Uber in 2013, Alphabet put $1 billion into Lyft last year, and Waymo won a $245 million stake in Uber in this month's settlement. Alphabet may not want to enter the ride-hailing business all over the world, given the massive resources that would take, industry analyst Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research said earlier this month. Waymo might end up part of either rival company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Uber &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/uber-ceo-hopes-to-have-self-driving-cars-in-service-in-18-months/" target="new"&gt;hopes&lt;/a&gt; to put autonomous cars into commercial service within 18 months, and Lyft announced a self-driving ride &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16742924/lyft-nutonomy-boston-self-driving-car" target="new"&gt;pilot in Boston last year and offered &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/my-ride-in-a-self-driving-lyft-showed-how-far-autonomou-1822029612" target="new"&gt;demonstration rides&lt;/a&gt; with different partner during International CES in Las Vegas last month. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;If autonomous ride services like these catch on, they may help save the environment. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, oil giant BP &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/bp-sees-self-driving-electric-vehicles-squeezing-oil-demand-by-2040.html" target="new"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that a combination of electric vehicles, shared mobility services and self-driving cars could reduce the use of oil for cars by 2040 -- or at least keep it from growing. BP's annual long-range forecast predicted the world's cars will use 18.6 billion barrels per day (bpd), down from 18.7 billion bpd in 2016. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The company expects a boom in shared, autonomous vehicles in the 2030s, with most of those vehicles having electric drivetrains because they require less maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;An average commuter spends 14% of his or her waking hours in the car, according to a study conducted by Arbitron/Edison Media Group. With Internet of Things (IoT) and newer technologies, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, revving up the automotive industry, the connected car is giving commuters newer ways to make rush hour more relaxing or productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's consumer is connected in three places -- their home, their office and their local coffee shop -- with evidence of companies shifting from connected car pilots to programs, connected cars are quickly steering their way into the becoming the "third place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time now, Starbucks has been known as a third place with its goal to provide all the comforts of home and office while enjoying a cup of coffee with friends and colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence of data, device and design, as well as advances in telematics, sensor technologies, in-vehicle infotainment and the cloud, will continue to shape the future of cars, making them ready to adopt more end-to-end technology solutions to provide newer ways to connect the home, office and casual driving experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's dig deeper into what is driving this momentum.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;b&gt;Creating the ultimate experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Today, the automobile industry is changing at breakneck speed. The cars we drive are changing, and so are the ways we commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial excitement is often overshadowed by uncertainty and reluctance to try something new. The focus on user experience (UX) is driving a profound shift in how connected cars are envisioned. In fact, UX is fast becoming the defining strategy of every company shifting toward the connected car market share. Forward-thinking UX holds up a mirror to the future that is a perfect "third place."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Evolving the continuum &amp;ndash; digital lifestyles &amp; cars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Mechanical excellence is no longer the battleground for automakers. To create meaningful innovations and capture consumers' interest in digital lifestyle, automakers must strive to understand users and care about their lives.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;It is all about building less of a machine and more of a car as a companion.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This evolution will require a collaboration between those who understand and advocate for the user and those who strategize and integrate the technology. Together, they will create cars of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Putting data in the driver's seat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Cars are increasingly becoming data powerhouses as they become ever more connected and empowered by smart, IoT technology.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The richness of insights is unlocking a digital gold rush around the connected car, transforming vehicles to be as unique as the people in them. The ability to carry out predictive, machine-learning driven analytics across datasets is creating huge potential for innovation. Putting this data in the driver's seat of the connected car will enhance the comfort and convenience of commuters.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;b&gt;Bringing new levels of connectivity to the car&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The automobile industry is a part of the same revolution that fuels our desire to stay connected -- anywhere, anytime. Connectivity is no longer an option, it is a key feature in turning your car into a customized extension of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be it Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) or even Vehicles-to-Phones, the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology incorporates connectivity into, well, everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Software is the new hardware&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We no longer have "car companies" -- these businesses are increasingly turning into software giants. Software-based platforms, of which AI-based technologies are a part, tend to make every aspect of the connected car more essential and also more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key imperatives to get ahead of this inevitable disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is user-centered design, or UCD.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;UCD is an amalgamation of design and science with the goal of making products and services user-desirable, business-viable and technologically feasible. Factor in behaviors, preferences, context, goals and aspirations while defining the connected car strategy.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Ask questions, build uses cases, personalize the experience. What is their "Job-To-be-Done?" What are their priorities? Are they doing five other things at the same time? How can the car help improve their lifestyle?&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is collaboration and co-creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it is be it incremental or breakthrough innovation, the concept of siloed genius dies hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is imperative for automakers to leverage their independent expertise and clout, isolated actions lead to a fragmented experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many existing companies have evolved into silos of expertise. To succeed, leveraging partnerships and participating in ecosystems becomes crucial for automotive manufacturers, suppliers and service providers.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few years will be an incredibly creative period. The cars we drive will change more than they have in the last century and become the true third place.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The act of publicly insulting a rival can be an art form unto itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorothy Parker once wrote of Audrey Hepburn's acting: "Miss Hepburn ran the whole gamut of emotions -- from A to B." Then there's football coach Steve Spurrier, who once said of a rival coach, "I saw a story saying Jim Haslett comes in at 4:30 every morning. That's not doing him much good."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Miller, director of autonomous vehicle integration at &lt;a href="http://www.gm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; took a more direct approach when he addressed the Australian media in Detroit in early October. Discussing rival Elon Musk and Tesla's efforts to achieve Level 5 autonomy in the future with the same core technology Tesla uses now, Miller described Musk as "full of crap."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The level of technology and knowing what it takes to do the mission, to say you can be a full level five with just cameras and radars is not physically possible," said Miller, as reported by &lt;a href="http://www.caradvice.com.au/589512/gm-elon-musk-is-full-of-crap-on-teslas-autonomous-capability/" target="new"&gt;Car Advice&lt;/a&gt;. "I think you need the right sensors and right computing package to do it. Think about it, we have Lidar, radar and cameras on [GM autonomous vehicles]. The reason we have that type of sensor package is that we think you need not be deeply integrated in to be level five, you should have redundancy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most companies, Tesla does not include &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;Lidar&lt;/a&gt;, a sensor technology that makes an autonomous vehicle system aware of its environment by sending out millions of laser pulses every second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Lidar has been maligned for being unwieldy and cost-prohibitive, most autonomous vehicle developers consider it to be an essential, even foundational component of a self-driving car's suite of sensors. Tesla puts a heavy emphasis on computer vision instead, as does &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734825" target="new"&gt;Lvl5&lt;/a&gt;, an AV startup founded by former Tesla engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Do you really want to trust just one sensor measuring the speed of the car coming out of an intersection before you pull out?" Miller said. "I think you need some confirmation. So, radar and Lidar do a good job at measuring object speed, cameras do a great job at identifying objects. So, you can use the right sensor images to give you confidence in what you're seeing, which I think is important if you're going to put this technology out for general consumption."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller is not the first to raise these questions about Tesla's AV systems, although he is the first high-level employee of one of Tesla's major competitors to do so so openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk and Tesla certainly have an impressive track record developing semi-autonomous systems, but whether they have what it takes to get over the hump for Level 5 autonomy remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For designers of self-driving cars -- and prospective consumers, as well -- Level 5 autonomy is the holy grail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehicle autonomy is rated on a scale from 0 to 5: At Level 1, a car can perform a single function, such as automatic braking, with the help of an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS). At Level 3, a car can be fully in control for certain portions of a trip, like highway driving, but a human driver needs to be attentive in case he needs to take over in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level 5, naturally, represents the point at which a car can handle any driving situation without any human interaction whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word most commonly used by AV experts to describe Level 5 autonomy is "theoretical."  The number of bizarre situations that could occur on the road are almost infinite, which makes it hard to know when an artificial intelligence system would be able to process them all sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why most companies have been reluctant to use the Level 5 label with their technology, even if it's referring to tech years (or decades) down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html" target="new"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; is fairly unique in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, the company unveiled a new AI computer system that it claims will be able to power Level 5 self-driving cars. Known as Pegasus, the system is the latest iteration of the company's Drive PX platform that has been operating in self-driving prototypes since its introduction in 2015. Last year, Drive PX 2 was released, and now Drive PX Pegasus has come along with the capability of delivering 320 trillion operations per second. That processing speed represents ten times the power of Drive PX 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rc4RqYLtEU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with many in the industry, Nvidia believes that the first consumer applications of self-driving cars will be for ride-hailing services or, as they are often called, robo-taxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The computational requirements of robo-taxis are enormous --perceiving the world through high-resolution, 360-degree surround cameras and Lidars, localizing the vehicle within centimeter accuracy, tracking vehicles and people around the car, and planning a safe and comfortable path to the destination," the company noted in a &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-world-s-first-ai-computer-to-make-robotaxis-a-reality" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "All this processing must be done with multiple levels of redundancy to ensure the highest level of safety. The computing demands of driverless vehicles are easily 50 to 100 times more intensive than the most advanced cars today."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 225 current partners, Nvidia's Drive PX is one of the foremost autonomous vehicle platforms in operation. Among the company's high-profile collaborators are Tesla, Toyota and Baidu. Nvidia says that 25 of its 225 partners are currently working on robo-taxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Today, their trunks resemble small data centers, loaded with racks of computers with server-class Nvidia GPUs running deep learning, computer vision and parallel computing algorithms. Their size, power demands and cost make them impractical for production vehicles," according to the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its latest product offering enhanced performance in a size that will be easier accommodated by cars that are transporting actual people, Nvidia is helping these robo-taxi developers take a large step closer towards launching their services. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A human operator does not necessarily intervene with the testing of driverless technology, as they are usually directed to only assume control of the vehicle in the case of an emergency. Since these human monitors don't hinder the testing of an AV, there is little downside to their presence. The upside, of course, is that they could help avoid a potentially catastrophic accident, and a public relations disaster for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, autonomous vehicle developers are eager to test their products without the proverbial safety net of a human monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies have been successfully testing driverless cars on roads for years now. They want to prove to consumers, investors and themselves that their products are ready to function in the way that they are meant to. And any state that will offer them the opportunity to do so will likely benefit from a much-wanted influx of AV test operations, and all the economic benefits that go along with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California recently took steps to allow driverless cars to be truly driverless. The state's Department of Motor Vehicles announced that it will soon permit the operation of registered self-driving cars to operate without a human driver in the automobile. The proclamation comes as part of a series of modifications to state AV regulations that the DMV announced on October 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to take the next step in furthering the development of this potentially life-saving technology in California," Transportation Secretary Brian Kelly noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/newsrel/2017/2017_67" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on the prospective safety benefits of autonomous vehicles in Kelly's speech mirrors that of Michigan Transportation Director Kirk Steudle, who acknowledged the risks of testing driverless cars without humans in them when his state became the first to permit such activity in December of last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's a risk worth taking because the future of the technologies we know are going to help reduce those crashes and reduce those fatalities," &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4017632/Michigan-lets-autonomous-cars-roads-without-human-driver.html" target="new"&gt;Steudle said&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this modification to its policy, California becomes the &lt;a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-vehicles-enacted-legislation.aspx" target="new"&gt;fifth state&lt;/a&gt; to allow AV testing without a human operator in the car, joining Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As AV industry consultant Grayson Brulte told Forbes, it's a move that is necessary for California to remain a top-tier destination for driverless testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"California is clearly on defense trying to defend the state's position as a leader in autonomous vehicle testing," &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/10/11/a-win-for-the-robots-california-poised-to-permit-human-free-driverless-car-tests/#53cb55ce6d5d" target="new"&gt;Brulte said&lt;/a&gt;. "It is a significant step toward the future of mobility."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of news of late about large investments being made in the autonomous vehicle sector. Some have come in the form of startup acquisitions, others have been through the establishment of funds specifically created to put money into autonomous startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each individual investment receives attention, it can be difficult to develop an understanding of the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington D.C. think tank The Brookings Institution recently addressed this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a new study published in mid-October, Brookings tracked acquisitions, investments and partnerships in driverless cars from August 2014 through June 2017 and found that the total investment was more than $80 billion. While the number itself is massive, Brookings was interested in doing more than just tallying dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The inquiry provides a useful window onto the state of play in development of autonomous vehicle technology, as entities from the major auto manufacturers to startups scramble to take the lead," according to the &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/gauging-investment-in-self-driving-cars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. "It is also a measure of what it takes to reach a tipping point in development of sophisticated artificial (or augmented) intelligence. As Qi Lu, the star Microsoft engineer who moved to Beijing to become Baidu's chief operation officer, recently put it, 'In autonomous systems, the car is the first major commercial application that is going to land.' Investment in self-driving cars appears to be the leading edge for AI development."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brookings' methodology was wide-ranging and thorough, but still imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privately owned companies have no obligation to report the terms of certain deals, or even to report the deals at all. And strategic partnerships by larger companies, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735423" target="new"&gt;the group&lt;/a&gt; working to develop an AV platform that includes Intel, Mobileye and BMW, are difficult to quantify in financial terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brookings also limited its search to English language sources, meaning many foreign deals that were only reported internationally likely went uncounted. If anything though, these exceptions suggest that the total figure of autonomous vehicle investment is even greater than the enormous sum of $80 billion that is detailed in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment trends in the autonomous vehicle space are promising not only for autonomous vehicles, but also for other artificial intelligence applications that utilize similar baseline technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If autonomous vehicles are the leading edge of artificial intelligence investment and development, then the $80 billion or more invested in that sector is a precursor of things to come in fields like natural language processing, image recognition, and others as these technologies gain commercial momentum," according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also notes that the number of announced investments in the AV space accelerated throughout the 2014 to 2017 timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the months that have passed since the survey concluded in June, there have been a significant number of new investments announced. Of course, not all of these individual investments will pan out, but the steady flow of money into the space is a strong indicator of the future success of the autonomous vehicle market as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When an accident happens between two vehicles today, figuring out who's at fault is fairly cut and dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is significantly more complicated when you imagine an accident involving an autonomous vehicle, especially if the self-driving car is at fault. There are any number of parties that could potentially be liable, from the OEM to the sensor manufacturer. Things get messy quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That murky nature is exactly what makes establishing responsibility standards an issue that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. No matter how much better they may be than human drivers, autonomous vehicles &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; still be involved in accidents and a protocol needs to be established that addresses those scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chip maker &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/autonomous-vehicles.html" target="new"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; is set to propose a set of industry-wide standards to do just that, and get self-driving car manufacturers on the same page in order to reduce unwanted liability in the cases of AV accidents, according to a Bloomberg Technology report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The standards, if endorsed by the automotive industry, its suppliers and regulators, would also be the basis of software in the vehicles that make sure the rules are followed," Ian King said, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-18/intel-proposes-system-to-make-self-driving-cars-blameless" target="new"&gt;according to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. "That would help speed the validation of autonomous technology, something that would benefit Intel's chip-making business."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after the Intel report came out, &lt;a href="http://www.mobileye.com/" target="new"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt; CEO and CTO Amnon Shashua and vice president of technology Shai Shalev-Shwartz co-wrote an editorial at The Hill arguing for the adoption of these standards. A sensor company that specializes in designing technology for autonomous vehicles, Mobileye is owned by Intel following a $15 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735423" target="new"&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; this past summer. The Mobileye executives proposed a model called Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) to shape unilateral standards for AV operational safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"[RSS] provides specific and measurable parameters for the human concepts of responsibility and caution and defines a 'safe state,' where the autonomous vehicle cannot cause an accident, no matter what action is taken by other vehicles," &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/technology/356015-we-can-design-driverless-cars-that-cannot-cause-an-accident" target="new"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; Shashua and Shalev-Shwartz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying implication with this proposal is that self-driving cars can reach a point where they are blameless from a legal perspective, which would be remarkable. While there are several reasons to challenge this assumption, it's still a good sign that AV developers are more concerned with preventing accidents than dealing with their aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If you know exactly the information you're seeking -- where you want to go eat, or what movie you want to see -- artificial intelligence doesn't offer a huge value add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Alexa or Siri or your connected car can tell you how to get where you want to go, but you probably already knew that. It's when you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; quite know what you're looking for that AI can help out immensely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine driving in an unfamiliar area and you get hungry, but you don't know the local dinner spots. An AI system that can tell you the most popular restaurants nearby, and spotlight the ones that align with your food preferences, would be very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nissan-robotaxis-will-hit-the-road-in-march-1512440776?mod=e2tw" target="new"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; from the Wall Street Journal, that's exactly what a new autonomous ride-hailing service from &lt;a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; will feature when it is launched in Japan. Easy Ride is a collaboration between Nissan and Japanese software company &lt;a href="http://dena.com/intl/" target="new"&gt;DeNA&lt;/a&gt;. It will feature a fleet of all-electric Nissan Leafs and will operate next between March 5 and 18 in Yokohama as an app-based ride-hailing service along the lines of Uber or Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the fact that these cars will drive themselves will make it a very different experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The two companies aim to combine the Nissan Intelligent Mobility vision, through technological assets in autonomous driving, vehicle electrification and connected cars, with DeNA's experience in developing and operating driverless mobility services using its expertise in the internet and artificial intelligence," Nissan and DeNA wrote in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-2f7966f516e271fc4ea0f79a9a005a1a-171205-01-e" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissan is currently encouraging people to sign up as participants for the two-week pilot project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to taking participants to any specific address they'd like within city limits, the app will also recommend local sightseeing attractions. The Journal reported that customers can type text commands as vague as, "I would like to eat pancakes" into the app and receive recommendations thanks to the AI technology provided by DeNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the initial pilot is slated to run for just two weeks, the WSJ reports that Nissan is hoping to launch a full-scale AV ride-hailing service in the early 2020s. Nissan is a couple years behind others in this emerging, and highly competitive, sector. But by focusing on the Japanese market, Nissan could differentiate itself enough to become a significant force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believe that ride-sharing and ride-hailing services operating autonomous fleets are the future of automotives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the need for human drivers, vehicles operating 24/7 could offer substantially higher profit margins than current services. So even though Nissan may be behind its competitors, the fact that the company is getting involved at all, instead of maintaining the status quo, is an encouraging sign for its future.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Of the many helpful safety features rolled into Advanced Driver Assistance Systems [ADAS], the most frequently deployed are warnings that alert a driver when he or she is approaching the vehicle in front of him too fast, usually because the vehicle in front braked unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing front-facing cameras and other sensors, ADAS can warn a driver to brake and, if those notifications go unheeded, the ADAS can initiate braking itself. In these situations, microseconds make the difference between a safe stop and a rear-ending. But if the driver behind knew what the driver in front was going to do in advance, the entire nerve-wracking situation could be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While drivers will never be able to read each other's minds, connected cars can effectively do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity (V2V) allows automobiles to "talk" to one another over mobile networks. This information can be used to avoid accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2017/12/133_240671.html" target="new"&gt;Korea Times&lt;/a&gt;, tech company &lt;a href="http://www.lg.com/us" target="new"&gt;LG Electronics&lt;/a&gt; is working to leverage V2V communication over LTE networks to prevent rear-end collisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the air, a car would signal surrounding vehicles of its intention to brake. If the trailing drivers didn't react appropriately by braking in turn, they would receive an audio warning from their car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they still don't respond, their vehicle would send a warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We developed the technology, overcoming setbacks from the advanced driver assistance system and sensor-based safety systems which can monitor vehicles or obstacles only in close by," an LG official told the Times. "The network-powered V2X system, however, can share multiple information from vehicle to vehicle in real-time, including vehicle location, speed and even road conditions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LG's connected car plans don't stop at V2V -- these extend to vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity (V2I). V2I refers to a car's ability to both send and receive information on road conditions from a central network. The hope is that by informing vehicles of road conditions in real-time, V2I can improve traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system developed by LG will inform equipped vehicles when construction sites are coming up in their journeys, giving drivers ample time to switch lanes in a safe fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These initiatives are part of a larger overall strategy by LG to become a bigger force in the connected car industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737650" target="new"&gt;announced a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/" target="new"&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; to develop connected and autonomous vehicle technology at a joint research center in Seoul. And these developments are only the beginning, according to LG senior vice president of auto-parts technology Yoon Yong-cheol, adding that "We are going to develop more and more next-generation connected vehicle systems in the future, as part of our bid to become a reliable partner for major automakers here and abroad." &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In the corporate food chain, the prevailing dynamic is big company tries to eat little company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When well-established entities with deep pockets see startups encroaching on their turf, they can get very defensive. A typical reaction is for the larger company to use its scale and resources to either take market share away from the startup and effectively starve it to death or to gobble up the smaller firm through acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, sometimes those large companies are so entrenched in their ways that they fail to recognize the potential of the smaller companies and they are free to grow into behemoths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech world is full of examples of this scenario. As a hybrid of traditional manufacturing and innovative technology, the autonomous vehicle sector seems to have gravitated toward a different approach, one where partnership is the name of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, small companies with big ideas latch onto big companies with big resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the case with &lt;a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/" target="new"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech giant is an outsized player in the consumer technology space, particularly with smartphones and household electronics. But its position in the automotive space is less established. To build up its clout, Samsung announced in December that it had been collaborating with mobility software company &lt;a href="https://renovo.auto/" target="new"&gt;Renovo&lt;/a&gt; to develop an operating system for a fleet of self-driving cars that the company plans to test on public roads in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaboration, which has been ongoing for the better part of 2017, is part of Samsung's Strategy &amp; Innovation Center (SSIC) Smart Machines Group, which is working to develop futuristic products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renovo's AV operating software, named AWare, will power Samsung's pilot fleet. In a &lt;a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/renovo-and-samsung-electronics-to-develop-highly-automated-vehicle-technology-2243105.htm" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, Renovo referred to AWare as built "for automated mobility on demand," giving customers access to self-driving cars "at the touch of a button."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That language would suggest that Samsung is pursuing a commercial AV ride-hailing fleet rather than designing a self-driving car to be marketed toward consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Renovo CEO Chris Heiser suggested in an &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/12/12/samsung-renovo-self-driving-cars/" target="new"&gt;interview with Fortune&lt;/a&gt; that such an application would be only one use case for the AWare operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to be a thin layer that works across lots of different vehicles, lots of different pieces of hardware, and works with pretty much any piece of software that someone would want to deploy on a vehicle," said Heiser. "So in a way it's like [Amazon Web Services], in that you can deploy software on it and you don't have to manage where it goes, you don't have to manage its lifecycle or data orchestration -- that's all done for you."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are not a lot of specifics about Samsung's plans in the driverless car space, but president Young Sohn &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738633" target="new"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; he thinks the company's revenue from automotives can quadruple from $5 billion today to $20 billion in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August, it was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/samsung-secures-self-driving-car-testing-permit-for-california-roads/" target="new"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung had been added to the &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing" target="new"&gt;California DMV's list&lt;/a&gt; of entities that have received permits to test self-driving cars in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Renovo received a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-invests-in-self-driving-car-startup-renovo-1493298001" target="new"&gt;$10 million round&lt;/a&gt; of funding from Verizon's True Ventures in April, the company has remained mostly under the radar as it pursues an OS for self-driving cars. Thanks to its partnership with Samsung, that will no longer be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Samsung is a global technology leader that helped disrupt the entire communications industry as traditional flip phones became the smartphones we use today," said Renovo's Heiser in the statement announcing the partnership. "With a similar transformation coming to the mobility sector, Samsung was the first and obvious choice for Renovo to partner with as a technology collaborator and investor."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Developing autonomous driving systems that perform at a high level in adverse weather conditions -- rain, sleet, snow and particularly at night -- has been a notoriously difficult challenge for AV engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is partly because of a Catch-22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a driverless system isn't capable of driving safely during a snowstorm, then it can't be safely tested during one. But if a driverless system can't be tested during a snowstorm, then the software and its developers will struggle to refine these abilities, and lack the ability to prove themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, autonomous vehicle developers have long tested on closed courses. And as the self-driving car industry has grown, so has the number and size of these facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 11, one of the most anticipated proving grounds opened for operation in Ypsilanti Township, Mich. In true Michigan fashion, it was only fitting that the first day of testing at the &lt;a href="http://www.acmwillowrun.org/" target="new"&gt;American Center for Mobility&lt;/a&gt; featured the very beast that driverless vehicle engineers are working to conquer: a snowstorm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located an hour west of Detroit, the American Center for Mobility, or the ACM, is a hub for driverless and connected car testing and a center for research, product development and education around autonomous vehicles. While ACM just officially opened, a number of new developments are already planned. Forthcoming construction will see an ACM headquarters, an urban driving environment, and a tech park added to the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, it's a state-of-the-art site for AV testing that includes a 2.5-mile highway loop and a 700-foot curved tunnel. The ACM is a public-private partnership. Corporations such as AT&amp;T, Visteon, Toyota, Ford and Hyundai were founding partners. Public entities involved include the Michigan Department of Transportation and the University of Michigan. Between them, the ACM has received $110 in funding thus far, with more expected from new private partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have moved fast for the ACM, where construction only began last May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to be open for testing and to have our founders already leveraging the assets of this facility," ACM CEO John Maddox noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.acmwillowrun.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ACM-Open-For-Testing.pdf" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We have been moving rapidly, and along with good input from our founders, a great deal of work has gone into developing this site. Opening our doors is just the beginning as we continue to develop the American Center for Mobility into a global hub for [connected and autonomous vehicles] and future mobility technologies to put self-driving cars on America's roads safely."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction on the ACM's remaining components will begin in spring 2018. In the interim, researchers and testers will be making the most of the volatile Michigan winter. Global auto parts supplier &lt;a href="https://www.visteon.com/" target="new"&gt;Visteon&lt;/a&gt; was taking advantage on Day 1, testing its DriveCore AV platform on the course as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVFsWoHAlk" target="new"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; came down hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days later, engineers from Toyota began setting up shop for their own testing on the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by Gov. Rick Snyder, Michigan has followed every possible lead in bringing driverless car business to the state. It is a natural extension of the automotive industry that built up Michigan's economy in the 1900s. According to Snyder, the ACM will play a large role in achieving the state's AV goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The American Center for Mobility will be the place where innovations go from the drawing board to the open road," Snyder said. "With ACM open for testing we are taking one giant step in the right direction to affirm Michigan's place as the undisputed leader in mobility."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The idea of cars silently signaling each other through walls is as futuristic as it sounds, but many electronics suppliers want to get going on it as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;On February 22, Qualcomm &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualcomm-and-leading-automotive-companies-across-the-globe-drive-the-commercialization-of-c-v2x-300602527.html" target="new"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; a long list of companies looking to use its 9150 C-V2X chipset, which is due to be demonstrated this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and shipped commercially in the second half of this year. The list includes well-known names such as BMW, LG Electronics, Continental, Sierra Wireless and ZTE. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/technologies/lte/advanced-pro/cellular-v2x" target="new"&gt;C-V2X&lt;/a&gt;, or cellular vehicle-to-anything, is a way to use cellular radios in cars to communicate with other vehicles, pedestrians' phones, and roadway infrastructure such as traffic signals and warning signs. One use of C-V2X would be to notify cars approaching a blind intersection that there's a speeding vehicle around the corner that's about to run a red light. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important for many different suppliers to join in on a technology like C-V2X, because it can't deliver benefits like safety unless a lot of things use the same system. Vendors from different industries all need to sign on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C-V2X uses 5G technology and is designed as one element of a complex set of sensors and networks, including Lidar and radar, that may someday keep self-driving cars informed about everything around them. Before that, C-V2X might help to keep manually driven vehicles from crashing into each other. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Automotive wireless networks such as C-V2X are starting to overcome the limits of human vision and robotic line of sight. With wireless signaling, cars can virtually see each other even where drivers can't and respond appropriately. In the example of the red-light runner at a blind corner, vehicles approaching the intersection could automatically brake or warn drivers to brake. If the traffic light had the right wireless radio, it might send a warning to the oncoming car or even stop it from running the red. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C-V2X isn't the only way to make all this work. There's also a wireless LAN standard related to WiFi that's used in technologies such as WLANp and Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC). Volkswagen Group &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740672" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that it would equip all its European cars with WLANp beginning next year. The US government has been pushing DSRC for several years. Qualcomm also has products in this category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Qualcomm says it has a global ecosystem of automakers, component suppliers, software companies and system integrators committed to C-V2X and the 9150 chipset. They include participants in China, South Korea, Japan, Germany, France and the US. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;One of the selling points for C-V2X is that it could build on the 5G mobile ecosystem and take advantage of carriers' cellular networks. In addition to direct wireless links among cars and nearby infrastructure like signs, C-V2X can connect cars to the larger cellular network. Those vehicle-to-network links could be used for services like traffic and hazard warnings, locations of parking spots, and streaming information and entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;California will allow autonomous cars without drivers next month but with a long list of conditions, including a cybersecurity requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most populous US state will &lt;a href=" https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/newsrel/2018/2018_17" target="new"&gt;allow driverless cars&lt;/a&gt; for testing and for public use beginning April 2, the Department of Motor Vehicles said on Monday, February 26. The agency won't permit driverless trucks or commercial vehicles but said it would study the safety and regulatory issues around that question. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As home to mild climates and some of the biggest autonomous car firms, California is the leading state for testing, with 50 companies approved to run trials. The state has issued permits to test self-driving vehicles with backup drivers since 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driverless cars might go commercial first in Arizona, where Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary plans to launch a robot taxi service this year around Phoenix and recently &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740723" target="new"&gt;won&lt;/a&gt; a car-for-hire license. But Waymo, Uber and GM's Cruise division, all based in the San Francisco Bay Area, are all pushing hard to get vehicles on the road without drivers. In statements sent to The Connected Car, all three welcomed the announcement but didn't say when they would deploy driverless cars in the state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans are still &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740775" target="new"&gt;wary&lt;/a&gt; of self-driving cars, and the long list of conditions that comes along with the new permission reflects some of their concerns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, any company providing a driverless car for public use will need to certify it meets "current industry standards" for protection against cyber attacks intended take control of the car or disable it, though those standards are still &lt;a href=" https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2017/12/18/to-handle-driverless-cars-cybersecurity-regulation-needs-a-software-update/" target="new"&gt;a work in progress&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a remote operator will have to be able to connect to the car. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Companies that want to test cars without drivers will need to notify local authorities in writing. The state will also keep requiring annual &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740229" target="new"&gt;disengagement reports&lt;/a&gt;, where companies doing tests disclose when and why autonomous systems failed or had to be overridden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that supposedly self-driving cars have had software failures and can't always deal with unexpected situations during testing has &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740572" target="new"&gt;raised some alarms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Companies will still be able to get permits to test self-driving cars with backup drivers onboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully driverless cars also raise other new questions, some of which the DMV has tried to address with its regulations. The cars will need a way to communicate with law enforcement when there's no one in the car for an officer to talk to. They'll also need to be able to transmit information about their owner or operator in the event of a crash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States are scrambling to set rules for self-driving cars, in part so they can participate in what is seen as a potentially huge industry that's just getting off the ground. This month, &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740650" target="new"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, Indiana, &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740807&amp;" target="new"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; and Washington, D.C., have taken or debated steps to regulate the technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics worry a crazy quilt of regulations will stunt the growth of a national industry. Congress is now considering legislation to set standards for self-driving and driverless vehicles. But the rules of the road are mostly set by the states. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Connected car technology platform provider Smartcar announced it has raised $10 million in Series A financing led by venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates (NEA), with participation from Andreessen Horowitz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartcar is focused on removing barriers to entry into automotive telematics by making it safer and easier to connect to vehicles. Specifically, the company is developing a series of APIs, software development kits (SDKs), and documentation that developers need to build connected car applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"From car sharing and fleet management, to smart parking and insurance, developers are using the Smartcar platform to pioneer a truly connected automotive world," Sahas Katta, co-founder and CEO, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smartcar-announces-10m-series-a-funding-from-nea-and-a16z-300606369.html/"target="new"&gt;March 1 statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katta explained Smartcar was founded 2015 after he became frustrated trying to figure out how to get a mobile app to connect to a vehicle, noting that although many cars are web-connected, there has not been an easy way for developers to integrate with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartcar's developer tools remove the friction that OEMs and app developers encounter when trying to create better integrations between web apps and digital vehicle systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's connected car platform lets developers read vehicle data and send commands using HTTP requests to any vehicles in a single engineering effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartcar, headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., uses the OAuth2 authorization framework, which allows applications to gain authorization to interact with vehicles using the Smartcar API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By taking advantage of embedded telematics hardware already present in vehicles, developers can use Smartcar's suite of SDKs and comprehensive API docs to build apps to communicate with vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $10 million haul follows a previous $2 million round of seed financing from Andreessen Horowitz, bringing the company's total financing raised to date &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smartcar"target="new"&gt;to $12 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Smartcar announced Forest Baskett from NEA and William Krause from Andreessen Horowitz will join the company's board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEA invests in technology and healthcare companies at all stages in a company's lifecycle, from seed stage through IPO and boasts $20 billion in cumulative committed capital since its founding in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late last year Hyundai Motor America announced a partnership with Smartcar to let their customers use new digital experiences built on the startup's platform with their vehicles starting early 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Automobility LA, an industry trade show converging the technology and automotive industries, the company showcased one of the first developers using Smartcar's platform, a mobility service called Washos which lets Hyundai owners order a car wash in just a few clicks from a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Smartcar API platform, Washos can now locate a customer's Hyundai vehicle for a wash and use a temporary digital key to unlock the doors to clean the interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in 2017 the company teamed up with BMW Group to enable developers to access select data from vehicles, which have built-in SIM cards for data connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of applications includes insurance, expense tracking, smart home, gas stations and mobility services.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA -- MWC 2018 -- True autonomous cars cruising everyday streets are still years away, but the 2018 Mobile World Congress offered a fairly good glimpse at what that future might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the show, auto makers, telecom operators, chip makers and technology companies showed off their abilities to bring 5G, Internet of Things and edge computing to connected and autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different combinations of technologies came together to offer competing visions of what these vehicles will do depending on which companies are involved. For instance, BMW and AT&amp;T offered a glimpse of their connected 7 Series sedan, while several booths away, Intel and Toyota offered a completely different vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercedes rolled out technology it calls "smart vision EQ fortwo," which will bring autonomy and electrical-power technology to the urban landscape in a compact form. For those wanting the full experience, the company also showed off its new A-Class, which offers a touch of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Qualcomm is looking to make itself irresistible to any and all car makers by offering its embedded Snapdragon chipset for a range of different vehicles that will offer WiFi, infotainment, as well as an eventual connection to 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Connected Car hit the showroom floor to experience the best and brightest examples of connected car developments and what these design mean for the future of autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of industries that will be disrupted as autonomous vehicles gain greater and greater acceptance, but few will be affected more than auto insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How stark the effect might be was revealed in new research by the firm KPMG. In a &lt;a href="https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/us/pdf/2017/06/chaotic-middle-autonomous-vehicle-paper.pdf" target="new"&gt;recently published report&lt;/a&gt;, titled "The Chaotic Middle: The Autonomous Vehicle And Disruption In Automobile Insurance," KPMG notes that the auto insurance sector could shrink by 71% by the year 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a equivalent to a loss of $137 billion compared to today's market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report is a follow-up to a study that KPMG did in 2015. In the current iteration, the actuarial models were extended ten years, to the year 2050. The added time frame showed how the rate of change accelerated for the insurance industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Insurance companies will have to make important strategic and tactical changes sooner than anticipated to navigate through this turbulent transformation of the industry," Jerry Albright, principal in KPMG's Actuarial and Insurance Risk practice, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2017/06/autonomous-vehicle-technology-could-shrink-auto-insurance-sector-by-71-by-2050-change-type-amount-of-insurance-sold.html"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "New business models bring about a decade or so of a 'chaotic middle' as insurers adjust their strategies and operations as autonomous vehicle technologies significantly deplete the need for personal auto insurance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason for the dramatic decline is the fact that as more and more autonomous vehicles take the road, it is expected that there will be fewer and fewer automobile accidents overall, which will result in fewer auto insurance claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auto insurance is currently a $247 billion business, but KPMG's model showed that could decrease significantly because of a trio of factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Safer cars&lt;/b&gt;. Autonomous technology is expected to make cars increasingly safe. KPMG estimated that auto accidents could decrease by as much as 90%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transfer of liability&lt;/b&gt;. The reason drivers need insurance is to protect them in the event of an accident caused by their own doing. If a driver rear-ends someone, the driver is at fault, but if "the driver" is a computer and a car is involved in an accident, the liability will likely shift to the OEM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mobility-on-demand&lt;/b&gt;. We have already seen the widespread adoption of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. If those options become the primary way people get around, then there will be fewer individually owned cars on the road and therefore fewer individual car insurance policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study shows that by 2024, on-demand travel is expected to become the way that the majority of people get around in cities and surrounding suburbs, eclipsing travel by personal vehicle. By 2035, that type of travel will become the new normal. That will force insurance companies to develop new products and shift into new sectors in order to remain viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a result [of the disruption], auto insurers may choose to branch out into home-related products, or other commercial coverage, to benefit from diversification," Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG Corporate Finance LLC, wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autonomous vehicles will also require new types of insurance. One of the biggest issues in the space right now is cybersecurity and insurance companies could create products that protect against hacking of driverless automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report notes that "transitions of this potential scale will not be smooth," going so far as to describe the events precipitating the change as the "perfect storm." But the transition will be even rougher if insurance companies fail to heed these warnings and keep conducting business as usual. The report concludes with a call to action that delineates steps that insurance companies can start taking now so that they aren't blindsided by the coming changes. These steps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the changing technology landscape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand your company's exposure to the change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Align with other insurers and form partnerships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate and train your people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand cost structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare your operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and monitor leading indicators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate your business strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be wise for insurance companies to listen to this call to action, because if they don't their complaints about upcoming changes will fall on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to autonomous vehicles on public roads there are still quite a few technological, safety and security hurdles that are being addressed before driverless cars are ready to take to the streets &lt;i&gt;en masse&lt;/i&gt;. But many of those issues are mitigated when you're talking about vehicles travelling routes with minimal deviation in closed spaces. A lot of the variables encountered on public streets quite simply don't exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why mining has become a rich seam for the deployment of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, Australia's &lt;a href="http://fmgl.com.au/"target="new"&gt;Fortescue Metals&lt;/a&gt; has taken another &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/fortescue-metals-to-automate-its-haul-truck-fleet/news-story/6d2b9babd4ddef26e5eadfee203b7489" target="new"&gt; significant step&lt;/a&gt; toward making its fleet fully autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of its &lt;a href="http://fmgl.com.au/media/3021/1685814.pdf" target="new"&gt;Innovation Projects&lt;/a&gt; for the 2018 fiscal year, Fortescue announced it would be expanding its autonomous hauling technology at its Solomon mining hub in Western Australia and initiating the deployment of the autonomous tech at its Chichester hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both mining projects are located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortescue first began using autonomous trucks to help haul iron ore in 2012 and now has 56 of these vehicles operating at the site. The trucks have led to an increase in productivity of 20%, according to the company. In the coming fiscal year, Fortescue intends to switch 12 more of the trucks that are currently driven by humans into autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chichester hub is another major mining operation for Fortescue, and the company has already begun upgrading its IT network at two mines in the hub to accommodate the rollout of autonomous haul trucks that will number approximately 100 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each conventional truck employs four drivers, so about 450 jobs will eventually go away as part of the transition. However, Fortescue's plan is to redeploy many of those workers into different parts of the operation in maintenance, technology and mine planning to offset the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully shifting to autonomous hauling trucks is expected to take about three years. And when the move is complete, Fortescue will surpass mining rival &lt;a href="http://www.riotinto.com/" target="new"&gt;Rio Tinto&lt;/a&gt; as the single biggest user of autonomous haul trucks. Rio's fleet is approximately 20% autonomous and is made up of 73 self-driving trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Fortescue, the move is smart for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the price of iron ore has fallen, it has required the company to dramatically cut operational costs. But autonomous vehicles also make a lot of sense in mining overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, technology required for these driverless trucks to operate in mines is already sophisticated enough that not using it would be foolish. It will be interesting to see if any other industries that conduct operations in sparsely populated closed-off areas -- such as logging -- begin to adapt the technology at more significant levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When Chinese Internet company Baidu introduced its new self-driving car technology at an artificial intelligence developer conference on July 5, one particular highlight stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, on the event's enormous screen, was live footage of Baidu CEO Robin Li cruising down a Beijing highway in the passenger seat of a car driving itself. As the audience cheered, Li conversed animatedly with the event's presenter, describing the thrills of the self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was only one problem: Self-driving cars on Chinese roads are illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Traffic Management Bureau is investigating Li's drive, in which he rode alongside a man in the driver's seat who did not touch the steering wheel, accelerator or brakes, according to a report from Beijing Youth Today. The car did not appear to be fully autonomous, instead relying on highway-specific features that allowed the automobile to keep up with traffic and brake as necessary, including in emergency situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The police support technology and innovation of autonomous driving, but it should be conducted legally, safely and scientifically," according to a Beijing Traffic Management Bureau statement. "Any violations of the law will lead to punishment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Li or his company may face some form of discipline, it is unlikely that it will rise to even the level of a slap on the wrist. As Chinese lawyer Ding Jinkun &lt;a href="http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1000463/baidu-ceo-reprimanded-for-riding-in-autonomous-vehicle"target="new"&gt;told Sixth Tone&lt;/a&gt;, the vagueness of Chinese laws that ban self-driving cars could result in Baidu being fined as little as 200 yuan, the equivalent of $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The punishment will be too light because there aren't any laws to deal with this issue," Ding said. "The company should have asked for permission from the traffic authorities or tested the car in a closed-off area instead of on the highway. Even though there's no law yet, they shouldn't risk public safety, given that the technology is still immature."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ding added that the vehicle used for the demonstration would likely be confiscated by authorities, in addition to a fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu has actually partnered with the Chinese government to help shape laws and policy around self-driving cars, as the company looks to -- legally -- introduce its own such vehicles onto Chinese roads by 2019. Such a close relationship with the authorities is perhaps what emboldened Baidu to break the current laws for this conference. It's unlikely the company would have done so if it believed that it could damage their relationship with the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Li's car-piloted highway drive got the headlines that it was surely designed to attract, the stunt may have had the side effect of overshadowing the significant announcements that Baidu made at their conference, which was billed as "Baidu Create."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company revealed that Apollo, its autonomous vehicle platform, had forged partnerships with over 50 companies to work towards developing a self-driving car that would compete with the world's leaders in that space. Partners include automakers, software companies, local governments and universities. Ford, TomTom and Nvidia are also partners.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The days of worrying about finding a parking spot are over for drivers of the new BMW 5 Series. Transportation analytics company Inrix recently announced that it will equip the forthcoming luxury sedan with a real-time parking service known as On-Street Parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service will predict on-street parking availability in an expanding network of American and German cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a resource and a technological standpoint, Inrix has emerged as a leader in this space. It pulls from the world's largest parking database in Inrix Parking, which has over 35 million parking spaces indexed in more than 100 countries. The available information goes even deeper in some locations, tracking real-time occupancy for over 20,000 parking spots around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At launch, the on-street parking service for the new BMWs will be available in seven German cities and nine in the United States: Boston; New York; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Phoenix; Seattle; San Francisco; and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a series of complex systems to synthesize, interpret and implement the knowledge provided by such immense amounts of data, and that's where Inrix claims its system will truly shine. On-Street Parking uses machine learning to predict parking spot availability in a specific location during a certain time of day. It works in conjunction with live information feeds that track spot occupancy in many of those locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a survey that Inrix conducted, 72% of respondents listed real-time parking availability as their most-desired navigation feature for a connected car. Other navigation features mentioned in the survey include road incident alerts and re-routing, as well as city guides. Real-time parking availability was the second-most desirable connected car feature overall, trailing only stolen vehicle warnings and tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Real-time parking is the most sought-after navigation feature because it addresses a pain point that affects everyone," Joe Berry, vice president and general manager of automotive at Inrix, wrote in &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inrix-powers-the-worlds-first-on-street-parking-service-in-a-connected-car-300483707.html" target="new"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The first automotive deployment of Inrix On-Street Parking solidifies BMW's position at the forefront of connected car technology with a focus on delivering the services drivers want the most."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey provided further insight into the general public's understanding of autonomous vehicles and connected cars. About 40% of respondents believed that autonomous cars will be safer than cars of today, a discouraging figure given that nearly all experts believe autonomous vehicles will bring &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/self-driving-cars-could-save-300000-lives-per-decade-in-america/407956/" target="news"&gt;significant advancements in safety&lt;/a&gt;. The survey indicates that there is still a significant amount of education needed before large swaths of consumers are comfortable with self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that Italy was the only country where a majority of survey respondents -- 60% -- indicated that autonomous cars would be safer than cars currently on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before its technology even hits the street in BMWs, Inrix is already moving  to broaden the scope of its data collection. Only a day after the BMW announcement, the company &lt;a href="http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/manufacturer-news/2017/07/06/inrix-and-apcoa-strike-deal-to-provide-parking-data-in-europe" target="new"&gt;publicized&lt;/a&gt; an agreement with Apcoa Parking Group to access information at over 9,000 locations across 13 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the technology offered by Inrix and self-parking features in cars that have now been &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2012/12/06/self-parking-cars-challenge/1743199/" target="new"&gt;on the market for years&lt;/a&gt;, one of the greatest hassles for anyone who has ever gotten behind the wheel drivers may soon become a relic of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It's a headline that's easy to imagine: "Self-Driving Car Refuses to Budge; Foils Police Chase." A public relations disaster for an autonomous vehicle manufacturer, though, would be the least of anyone's worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a clueless driverless car blocked traffic and prevented a fire truck or ambulance from reaching its destination, people could lose their lives. It's a nightmare scenario that has undoubtedly caused sleepless nights for more than one AV developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it's a possibility that autonomous vehicle manufacturers are working diligently to preclude. &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/11/waymo-teaches-autonomous-cars-to-detect-emergency-vehicles/" target="new"&gt;Early in July&lt;/a&gt;, as Engadget reported, Waymo brought its self-driving prototypes to the streets of Chandler, Ariz., to train its cars to detect emergency vehicles and respond accordingly. Waymo worked in conjunction with both the Chandler Police Department and the Chandler Fire Department, as siren-sounding ambulances, fire trucks, police cars and even motorcycles drove around the Waymo cars at a variety of distances and in a variety of different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While moving aside for an ambulance may not seem like a tall order for a car that is literally driving itself, there are a series of factors that can make it challenging for an autonomous vehicle to detect an emergency vehicle and to respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, emergency sirens span a wide variety of sounds, all of which can be distorted by distance and geography. Once a car's system has established that an emergency vehicle is approaching -- as opposed to driving in a different direction entirely, a challenge in and of itself -- it must deal with somewhat unpredictable traffic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734174" target="new"&gt;Waymo's cars&lt;/a&gt; have long had the ability to detect and react to the presence of emergency vehicles, but recent technological innovations and hardware upgrades led the company to decide it was time to improve their fleet's capabilities in this arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our self-driving minivans are outfitted with custom-built self-driving sensors, including an audio detection system designed in-house," wrote Waymo in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/recognizing-the-sights-and-sounds-of-emergency-vehicles-8161e90d137e" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt;. "Not only have we improved the way our cars hear sirens, but our vehicles can see emergency vehicles and their flashing lights even further and clearer with our custom vision system, radars, and LiDARs. These advanced sensors allow us to both reliably detect emergency vehicles in real-time, and collect better information to train our software."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6hbd8N3j7bg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo's usage of roads in Chandler wasn't a coincidence. &lt;a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/chandler/2017/02/07/self-driving-car-waymo-intel-chandler-tempe/96772654/" target="new"&gt;Earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, Waymo added Chandler and fellow Arizona municipality Tempe to an ever-growing list of cities that the company uses as testing grounds. This group also includes Austin, Texas and Kirkland, Wash. "I can think of no better place to push the boundaries and test those limits than right here in Arizona," Governor Doug Ducey said late last year. In April, as AZ Central reported, the company &lt;a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/tech/2017/04/25/google-self-driving-cars-phoenix-area-residents/100875448/" target="new"&gt;sought volunteers&lt;/a&gt; throughout the state to take rides in its self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With several self-driving cars already successfully navigating our roads, it's easy to assume that autonomous vehicles are ready to hit the streets &lt;i&gt;en masse&lt;/i&gt;. And that may indeed be true, depending on who you ask. But there's no debating that automakers ought to be working constantly to make self-driving car technology as safe as possible. With the life-or-death situations that the open road presents, it's an imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;While "telematics" may not be very familiar to the layperson, it is a well known term in the autonomous vehicle sector. Referring to technology that records and transmits detailed, comprehensive data about driver behaviors and vehicular diagnostics, it is already hugely important in the automotive space generally and is likely to be even more so as more autonomous vehicles take the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps most important right now in the insurance industry, where telematics is being leveraged into practical, groundbreaking platforms at an increasing pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That process was accelerated further recently, when &lt;a href="https://www.octotelematics.com/" target="new"&gt;Octo Telematics&lt;/a&gt; announced the launch of its Next Generation Platform. The Internet of Things (IoT) platform will allow insurance and automotive services to easily customize their own telematics products. With this infrastructure in place, the number of telematics offerings for enterprises and consumers will only expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Next Generation Platform is a truly unique offering, merging the flexibility and openness of a horizontal IoT framework with the go-to-market readiness of vertical-Business Applications," &lt;a href="https://iotbusinessnews.com/2017/07/11/40113-octo-telematics-launches-new-internet-things-insurance-platform/" target="new"&gt;Octo COO Gianfranco Giannella wrote &lt;/a&gt; in a statement. "Therefore, providing current and prospective partners the best of both worlds and democratizing access to valuable data analytics to drive further innovation of services for the insurance industry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For auto insurance, easily available telematics technology is a game-changer with the potential to fundamentally change the industry. Hardware ranging from in-car diagnostics trackers to cell phone sensors are capable of monitoring driver patterns in speed, turning, braking and many other variables. Combined with GPS capabilities, comprehensive records of a driver's behavior can be generated. With the power of telematics, that data can be analyzed to determine how safe a driver is being and offer suggestions for what they can do to improve their driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several such products are already on the market. For years, Allstate has offered the telematics-driven product &lt;a href="https://www.allstate.com/drive-wise.aspx" target="new"&gt;Drivewise&lt;/a&gt;. With the tagline "Drive smart, earn rewards," Drivewise uses hardware installed in customers' cars to track driving patterns. Safe driving practices -- staying below 80mph, limiting late-night trips and braking smoothly -- allows Allstate's clients to earn rewards points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Vodafone and German insurer Wuerttembergische Versicherung &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=734283" target="new"&gt;partnered to offer a telematics smartphone app&lt;/a&gt; to drivers under the age of 30. Using sensors on users' cell phones to track their driving, the app rates users' driving and offers tips to improve. Wuerttembergische Versicherung customers who are deemed safe drivers by the app can see their premiums drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platforms like Octo's Next Generation Platform can enable more such products. The number of user-based insurance policies -- policies for which premiums are based on customers' driving behavior -- is projected to reach nearly 100 million by 2020. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.ptolemus.com" target="new"&gt;Ptolemus Consulting Group&lt;/a&gt; released a report that predicted that 50% of the world's vehicles will be insured through user-based policies by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Octo invested heavily into Next Generation Platform, spending more than $40 million on its development. It wasn't a solo venture, though. Octo's partners included &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=1956"target="new"&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=821"target="new"&gt;SAS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=820"target="new"&gt;SAP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=1098"target="new"&gt;Software AG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his part, Software AG CTO Dr. Wolfram Jost is enthusiastic about the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The magnitude of Octo's IoT vision is breathtaking and working with Octo's team in utilizing, extending and further developing our IoT software portfolio has been co-innovation at its best," Jost wrote in a statement. "This is the perfect way to partner in developing new digital IoT services: deep industry expertise from Octo combined with Software AG's leading edge technology -- together delivering a huge competitive advantage to customers and revolutionizing their businesses."&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;By almost any standard, the US federal government can be characterized as friendly to the autonomous vehicle industry. For the past decade or so, national legislative bodies have been mostly hands-off in regulating autonomous vehicle technology, leaving it to individual states to invite the industry to their roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, developers have had excellent access to on-road testing and other perks in enthusiastic states like California, Arizona and Michigan. This fall, Congress will weigh in on a bill package that restricts states' opportunities to ban self-driving cars, and also gives the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration a far greater number of exemptions for driverless vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As AV technology has advanced, the national government has only grown friendlier towards its designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the US is not alone in its enthusiastic reception to autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-trial-self-driving-trucks-platoons-roads" target="new"&gt; UK recently announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to perform trials with platoons of self-driving trucks. With trucks built by engineering firm &lt;a href="https://ricardo.com/" target="new"&gt;Ricardo&lt;/a&gt;, the government's Transit Research Laboratory (TRL) will soon begin testing the trucks on private tracks, with public road trials slated for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to be supporting the Government's ambition for the UK to be a global leader for innovation," Jim O'Sullivan, chief executive of Highways England, wrote in a statement. "The trial has the potential to demonstrate how greater automation of vehicles... can deliver improvements in safety, better journeys for road users and reduction in vehicle emissions. Investing in this research shows we care about those using our roads, the economy and the environment, and safety will be integral as we take forward this work with TRL."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platooning of trucks enables them to have a lower level of autonomous technology than what we normally associate with driverless cars. A series of trucks follows a single leader truck that has a driver, and uses a wireless network to mimic its acceleration, turning and braking. The concept figures to save energy by eliminating unnecessary braking and reducing wind resistance for the driverless trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They're always able to talk with one another," &lt;a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-trial-self-driving-trucks-platoons-roads" target="new"&gt;Richard Cuerden&lt;/a&gt;, academy director at TRL, told Wired. "Because the robot driving trucks two and three can react so much quicker than you and I can, we can get them so much closer together."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some potential downsides to this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to laws and regulations, a government could tailor conditions to its own ventures over those of private companies, and many would argue that private industry ought not have to play by a government's rules. Of particular concern is the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0eaef0be-aa88-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122" target="new"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; report from this past November claiming that Daimler and Scania "snubbed" the TRL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, though, this has to be seen as a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By signaling that it is in favor of putting autonomous vehicles on the road, the British government is telling companies that their contributions to the AV sector will be viewed with excitement instead of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, public money getting pumped into AV development via government contracts is an unqualified positive. With the societal benefits expected to be brought about by a driverless future, we may soon see more governments following the UK's lead.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Few things can temporarily derail your life like a power outage in your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your food might spoil while the refrigerator is without juice. Depending on your heating setup, you could even be left cold in the winter, and you'd definitely be without air conditioning in the summer. Without power for your modem, you would be without Internet access and, oh yeah, you might need some candles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that all sounds like a huge inconvenience, imagine losing power in an all-electric vehicle. It would be an even bigger, and potentially more dangerous, issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many differences between the two scenarios. Power outages in homes are usually from a grid issue, while electric vehicles run off of battery packs. As long as it's charged, a battery tends to be pretty reliable, but electrical failures still occur in vehicles. The problem is usually caused by short circuiting, and it can become a serious danger. This is a problem that quite simply &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; occur. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/" target="new"&gt;Delphi Automotive&lt;/a&gt; has placed tremendous emphasis on studying electric systems in cars, how they can malfunction, and what can be done to prevent that from occurring. In a &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170829/BLOG06/170829756/autonomy-48-volt-powertrains-amp-up-electrical-system-complexity" target="new"&gt;story for Automotive News&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Truett went behind the scenes at Delphi to see how the company is developing backup systems in cars to ensure steady and safe operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For safety critical systems, we don't want to leave the driver stranded," Delphi vice president of engineering Mary Gustanski said. "We [have to] make sure there is a way to get you where you need to be, maybe in limp-home mode. So, in the vehicle's electrical architecture we [might] go to centralized computing, one for safety and one for the electrical architecture because they end up backing each other up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building redundancy into a vehicle's systems, weight and cost are easily the two biggest factors for engineers. By using new, lightweight aluminum wires, Delphi is able to reduce both weight and costs compared to the traditional heavy copper cables used in vehicles' electrical systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Delphi, this electrical work is emblematic of the company's overall approach to solving the issues for tomorrow's car before they ever become issues at all. Investors are taking notice: The company saw its revenue &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-reports-second-quarter-2017-financial-results" target="new"&gt;increase 5%&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important for its long-term success is that other companies are just as enthusiastic about what Delphi is doing with electric cars, connected cars, self-driving cars and the various intersections of the three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/bmw-group-intel-and-mobileye-announce-delphi-as-a-development-partner-and-system-integrator-for-their-autonomous-driving-platform/" target="new"&gt;Delphi joined&lt;/a&gt; the BMW-Intel-Mobileye (and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735698" target="new"&gt;now Fiat-Chrysler&lt;/a&gt;) partnership that has quickly become a major force in AV development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a great opportunity for Delphi to use its technical depth and experience with automated driving and electrical architecture to help the cooperation develop and deploy at scale," Delphi CEO and president Kevin Clark said of the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated by the breadth and depth of Delphi's work in EVs and AVs, it's an equally great opportunity for Delphi's partners.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In late July, the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Ontario Department of Transportation co-sponsored a maiden voyage -- a 300-mile round-trip journey between the two regions that represented the first ever trek across international borders by a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the DOTs, two automotive technology companies, Magna and Continental, piloted the two vehicles involved. For all four organizations, it was an opportunity to showcase their abilities in a sector that figures to change the world -- and they said as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With our commitment to innovation and ongoing work in helping define the future mobility landscape, our involvement is a natural fit and we are pleased to join with our partners in this hands-free road trip," &lt;a href="http://www.magna.com/media/press-releases-news/releases-news/2017/07/31/joint-news-release---international-autonomous-drive-to-highlight-great-lakes-region's-leadership-in-mobility" target="new"&gt;Tom Tuma&lt;/a&gt;, global product manager at &lt;a href="http://www.magna.com/" target="new"&gt;Magna&lt;/a&gt; Electronics, wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Magna has inserted itself even deeper into the self-driving car space with a product that could be a game-changer. &lt;a href="http://www.magna.com/media/press-releases-news/releases-news/2017/08/31/news-release---magna-unveils-max4-autonomous-driving-platform" target="new"&gt;The Max4&lt;/a&gt; is "a fully integrated, customizable and scalable autonomous driving sensing and compute platform that can enable up to Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities in both urban and highway environments."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, the Max4 is not a self-driving car.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, it's a self-driving &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt;. It combines a bundle of physical components -- radar, Lidar, cameras, ultrasonic sensors -- with the type of highly advanced computer platform that's needed to assemble and interpret the information from all those components and turn it into the effective operation of a full-sized vehicle. Critically, Magna claims that the system will be adaptable to all types of vehicles, meaning that any car could become a self-driving one if equipped with the Max4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At the heart of this development is a desire to show the market Magna's breadth of capabilities and an autonomous driving enabling platform with subsystems that do not compromise the interior and exterior of a vehicle," Magna CTO Swamy Kotagiri noted in the announcement. "Our focus is on developing production-ready solutions that offer flexibility to integrate and the framework to enable Level 4 technology for when the market is ready."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magna refers to the Max4 as "scalable" multiple times throughout its announcement, and that will be the biggest challenge for the system. One of the technologies it incorporates, Lidar, is well-known for being &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;difficult to scale&lt;/a&gt; in the current climate. Lidar sensors shoot out millions of laser pulses per second to determine the exact composition of a self-driving car's immediate environment. It is, however, widely considered too expensive for mass market production. If Magna has solved that problem to any extent, that may be the biggest headline from this announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"One of the targets for Magna was to simplify the way drivers engage with autonomous driving systems including the option of an intuitive and familiar cruise-control-like user interface that is controlled through the press of a button," reads the Max4 announcement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Magna is looking to make autonomous driving more accessible on multiple fronts. First, by creating a versatile product that is compatible with a large number of vehicles. And second, by making sure that the people operating that product are completely comfortable using it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The autonomous vehicle technology that lives inside an automobile is, all things considered, already quite advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars have already traveled millions of miles on public American roads, with few incidents. The capabilities of the hardware -- sensors, cameras and the like -- and the software that powers the AVs of today is remarkable, considering how recently companies began developing self-driving cars in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for these vehicles to be on the road in significant numbers and become a viable option for regular transportation, certain physical and digital infrastructure need to be developed. It's not government regulation or insufficient in-vehicle technology that remains the biggest hurdle to a full AV future, but rather the connective networks that are yet to be designed and built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, these networks are starting to come together, slowly but surely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm made big news recently with the unveiling of a new Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) chipset and reference design that could be a valuable tool in optimizing the capabilities of self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Today's introduction of the Qualcomm 9150 C-V2X chipset builds on our leadership in automotive technologies, demonstrating our continued commitment to design and offer advanced solutions for safe, connected and increasingly autonomous vehicles," Nakul Duggal, vice president of product management at Qualcomm Technologies, wrote &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/09/01/qualcomm-announces-groundbreaking-cellular-v2x-solution-support-automotive" target="new"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With its strong synergy with telematics and an evolution towards 5G, C-V2X offers benefits to the automotive industry by developing new capabilities for improving road safety, and enhancing autonomous driving and advanced connected services, while building on the ITS momentum and investments made over the last decade," Duggal added. "C-V2X is expected to support safer roads, increase productivity and decrease traffic congestion. We look forward to seeing our 9150 C-V2X chipset play a key role in assisting the global market to achieve these benefits."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives from Audi, Ford, Groupe PSA (of France) and SAIC Motor (of China) all came out in praise of Qualcomm and its latest product, a demonstration of the strength of Qualcomm's partnerships, which will help put its C-V2X tech to good use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V2X is a term used to refer to all sorts of more specific vehicle communications systems, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology is almost limitless and forms the foundation of why so many believe our AV future will feature roads that are safer and more efficient by orders of magnitude. For example, cars that can "talk" to one another with V2V technology are far more likely to avoid collision with one another and travel along effective traffic patterns, but also can pass along information that they have individually perceived, such as traffic irregularities elsewhere. A road on which all vehicles are in communication with one another will be a safer road indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As emerging technology -- namely, 5G wireless networks -- is perfected and brought to market at scale, V2X offerings will become even more empowered to serve connected cars and their passengers. Before too long, it will be hard to imagine automotives without them.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If you live on the East Coast, in the South or the Midwest -- with the exception of Michigan -- there's a strong chance that you've never seen a self-driving car in action.&lt;/p&gt;

States in these regions are stricter when it comes to self-driving car regulation than their Western counterparts. Self-driving cars are so rare in the East that folks might not even recognize one if they saw it.

However, in the Southwest and West (and Michigan), autonomous vehicles are becoming more commonplace on public roads since these are the most common testing areas in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the  Bay Area -- the center of the world when it comes to tech innovation -- it is quite common to see self-driving cars. For many San Franciscans, seeing a coffee can-shaped Lidar sensor on the roof of the car next to you -- or something like it -- is part of the daily commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more AVs are set to hit the road in San Francisco soon, and they'll be doing more than just collecting data. These vehicles will be taking locals to work, dinner or a friend's house. Ride-sharing company &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that it will be partnering with AV tech startup &lt;a href="https://www.drive.ai/" target="new"&gt;Drive.ai&lt;/a&gt; to allow for autonomous rides in San Francisco. As dictated by California law, the self-driving cars will be monitored by a Drive.ai technician in the driver's seat to ensure safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded two years ago at Stanford's AI Lab, Drive.ai has made enormous waves in the AV space as evidenced by the company's &lt;a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/driveai-raises-50-million-to-accelerate-the-self-driving-reality-2223967.htm" target="new"&gt;$50 million Series B&lt;/a&gt; round of fundraising announced in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its origin and name make clear, Drive.ai is focused on artificial intelligence specific to autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMvgtPN2IBU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The partnership certainly isn't Lyft's first foray into the self-driving space, either. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/09/07/lyft-accelerates-driverless-car-push-with-bay-area-partnership-with-drive-ai/#16c05363c5a5" target="new"&gt;As Forbes notes&lt;/a&gt;, its previous collaborations in AV include work with GM's Cruise, Waymo, Jaguar Land Rover and nuTonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Drive.ai and Lyft are both working toward a future where self-driving vehicles radically improve the lives of millions," &lt;a href="https://blog.lyft.com/posts/2017/9/6/lyft-partners-with-driveai" target="new"&gt;Drive.ai CEO Sameep Tandon&lt;/a&gt; noted in a blog post. "By launching this pilot, we're taking a giant step to advance that reality. As we deploy Drive.ai's safe, intelligent autonomous vehicles on the city streets, we can begin to build public understanding and trust. Self-driving cars have so much to offer, from safety to convenience, and we can't wait for consumers to experience this for themselves."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presumably, riders will have the option to opt in to getting a ride from one of the Drive.ai AVs operated by Lyft, as the idea could potentially make unexpecting customers uncomfortable. Given that tech workers constitute a large percentage of Lyft's San Fran clientele, though, it seems doubtful that many users will be opting out.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The services that most connected car owners have grown accustomed to are enabled primarily by 4G LTE technology, the same connectivity that lets you stream video on a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a car, 4G LTE is generally up to the task for things like powering navigation services and streaming music. But the next generation of connected cars -- semi- or fully autonomous vehicles -- are going to require significantly more bandwidth. A lot of computing needs to happen in a short amount of time in order for vehicles to "talk" to other vehicles and infrastructure elements. With no margin for error, there needs to be a higher level of cellular connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telecommunications companies have been leading the charge in developing 5G technology for vehicle connectivity. On October 19, one of the biggest suppliers to telecoms, &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/" target="new"&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it was partnering with &lt;a href="http://www.lg.com/us" target="new"&gt;LG Electronics&lt;/a&gt; on a joint effort to develop next-generation connected car technology. LG and Qualcomm have already opened a research center in Seoul and plan to open a second by the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Building on our long-standing relationship with LG, this effort to advance C-V2X [Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything] technology further demonstrates our continued commitment to the development of advanced solutions for safe, connected and increasingly autonomous vehicles," Qualcomm Vice President of Product Management Nakul Duggal said in a &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2017/10/lg-and-qualcomm-to-jointly-research-and-develop-next-gen-connectivty-solutions-for-cars/" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "With the automotive industry on a clear path to 5G, we look forward to working together with LG to meet the demands of today's drivers and advance the commercialization of C-V2X technology in next-gen vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"LG plans to lead the next-generation vehicle components market by combining our experience in automotive communication technologies with Qualcomm's advanced connected solutions from LTE to 5G," said Kim Jin-yong, executive VP of LG's Vehicle Components Smart Business Unit. "We are optimistic that the combined research strength of Qualcomm and LG will yield benefits that would not be feasible working independently."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 5G connectivity, the connected car of tomorrow will constantly send and receive huge amounts of data on a second-by-second basis that details the vehicle's surroundings and traffic circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity, cars will "talk" to one another, declaring their intentions and ensuring that they maintain safe distances from one another. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity will link automobiles with a broader, all-encompassing network to maintain safe and efficient traffic patterns. Picture traffic lights that use real-time data to determine the intervals at which the lights change from green to yellow to red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These networks will become of great importance as autonomous vehicles become commonplace on our roads because they will give crucial context to AV systems beyond what they can sense in their immediate vicinities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Qualcomm, the announcement of the partnership with LG came around the same time as another 5G collaboration, albeit one that doesn't focus on vehicles. Qualcomm recently formed a &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/10/17/verizon-qualcomm-and-novatel-wireless-announce-collaboration-expedite" target="new"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Verizon and Novatel Wireless to develop 5G New Radio millimeter wave technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that development places greater emphasis on mobile devices than cars, the advancement of any 5G technology is a win for the future of the Internet of Things, connected cars, and autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Cities that host self-driving car pilot programs seem to enjoy a lot of benefits as a result of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The municipalities open to on-road autonomous vehicle testing can attract permanent outposts of businesses working on AV development. The college town of Ann Arbor, Mich., has become home to research facilities for companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734742" target="new"&gt;Navya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735186" target="new"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;. In Pittsburgh, the city's Strip District is being revitalized &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736486" target="new"&gt;thanks in large part&lt;/a&gt; to companies like &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/pittsburgh/self-driving-ubers/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.argo.ai/" target="new"&gt;Argo AI&lt;/a&gt;. And the Bay Area, of course, is the primary testing site for more than a few AV outfits.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While harder to quantify, there is also a halo effect that occurs in pro-driverless car cities. They are able to brand themselves as forward thinking, which can lead to other progressive industries migrating to their borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So cities must be lining up to attract self-driving car companies, right? Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://avsincities.bloomberg.org/" target="new"&gt;new project&lt;/a&gt; by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Aspen Institute called the Global Atlas of Autonomous Vehicles in Cities charts where AV development is taking place around the world. The collaborative effort is billed as a tool for cities to gain an understanding of what their peers are doing to promote autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This Atlas is the world's first inventory of how cities around the globe are preparing for the transition to a world with AVs," reads the Atlas's main page. "As cities seek to learn from one another, they can look to this map for up-to-date information on what's underway worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Atlas lists 35 cities around the world that already have autonomous vehicle projects up and running. Geographically, the US has the highest number of cities participating with ten. In Europe, the UK and the Netherlands are leading the way with four cities each. And China has the most in Asia with three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As news of autonomous vehicle development has spread, one might expect the number of cities that are researching AVs with the intent of launching pilot projects to be larger, but there are only 18 cities currently included.&lt;/p&gt;

{image 1}

&lt;p&gt;The report acknowledged that even for cities that have pilot programs, things are still in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"City planning for autonomous vehicles is new. Fully a quarter of the 38 cities surveyed only prioritized the issue in the last year. Fewer than 1 in 10 cities have been working on AVs for more than three years," the report found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving "last mile" problems was the primary reason that cities decided to launch autonomous pilot programs. "The most common anticipated role for AVs is bridging existing gaps at the edges of transit systems." While those in more concentrated urban areas tend to have a number of ways to get around, those on the outskirts of public transportation and who might not be serviced by ride-sharing services like Lyft still have many issues getting around.&lt;/p&gt;

{image 2}

&lt;p&gt;Understandably, launching an autonomous pilot program comes with a number of challenges for cities. Chief among those is money. The biggest barrier to AV pilots was "lack of funds." But on the positive side, "local opposition" to autonomous vehicles was tied for the smallest barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part of the Bloomberg initiative is that it is ongoing. Municipalities will be able to continually refer to it to learn more about which cities are getting involved with autonomous vehicles and how they're doing it. That kind of open exchange of information can only benefit the future rollout of more self-driving programs.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the autonomous vehicle industry is best viewed through the lens of the food chain. The larger companies, be they OEMs or tech giants, try to gobble up the little ones, often startups tackling a particular piece of the overall puzzle that the larger companies hope to be the first to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a limited number of these startups out there, the giants try to snatch them up as quick as they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; is the definition of a "big fish" in the autonomous vehicle sea. And the company is certainly hungry. Following the release of GM's third-quarter earnings, CEO Mary Barra and CFO Chuck Stevens each spoke on the company's recent acquisition of Lidar manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/strobeinc/" target="new"&gt;Strobe Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, and explicity stated that it won't be the last such purchase for GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have been actively looking at technology opportunities to enhance and speed the development, safely, of autonomous vehicles into the market," said Stevens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is fast-moving and we're going to look at what makes the most sense to allow us to go with speed, with safety and to deliver value," Barra added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For GM, the acquisition of Strobe, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737289" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in October, represents what the company believes could be a game-changing addition for its self-driving division, &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Strobe's new chip-scale Lidar technology will significantly enhance the capabilities of our self-driving cars. But perhaps more importantly, by collapsing the entire sensor down to a single chip, we'll reduce the cost of each Lidar on our self-driving cars by 99%," Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt wrote in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/how-were-solving-the-lidar-problem-8b4363ff30db" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt;. "As the cost of our self-driving vehicles declines, we'll be able to accelerate the rate of vehicle production and more quickly roll out our technology to suburban and rural areas where ride sharing is less common today."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late September, Crunchbase published &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/23/automakers-accelerate-their-interest-in-startups/" target="new"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing how outright mergers and acquisitions by major automakers have been eclipsed in favor of investment rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While it was a big year for startup investment by automakers, M&amp;A has been slower. That's not abnormal, as car companies generally don't buy a lot of startups, although they do the occasional big deal or smaller asset purchase," Crunchbase's Joanna Glasner wrote. However, she also commented on the benefits of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The global recession of 2008-2009 required heavy cuts to R&amp;D for many struggling automakers, and in the last couple of years they've been playing catch-up. Bringing in an outside startup can be a good way to speed up internal efforts."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its stock hitting record highs in recent months, GM stands out as a leader among major automakers in the AV space. If competitors see acquisitions paying off big for GM, it's likely that we'll see more automakers following suit.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If there was ever any question as to whether Velodyne was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; industry leader in Lidar, it was eliminated with the announcement last summer that two of the biggest global names in autonomous vehicles, Ford and Baidu, had placed their faith -- and their money to the tune of $150 million -- into the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our investment will accelerate our efforts in autonomous driving with what, in our view, are the best Lidar sensors available today," Baidu Senior Vice President Jing Wang &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160816005465/en/Velodyne-LiDAR-Gears-Autonomous-Revolution-Investments-Ford" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, The Verge's Ben Popper wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16491052/velodyne-lidar-mapping-self-driving-car-david-hall-interview" target="new"&gt;in-depth profile&lt;/a&gt; about the man behind &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt;, founder David Hall. Hall is an inventor first and foremost and his background is unique in the tech industry. The story is worth reading in full, but here are three key takeaways about Hall and the company that made him a billionaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Velodyne started out making speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velodyne didn't start out making sensors for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its first product was a speaker, the ULD-18, that was released in 1988 and became a hit with critics and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As I heard the solid, gut-punching bass note, I felt the wood floor flex under my feet! The impact of the floor shock reminded me of the shift caused by a Richter 4.5 earthquake," wrote a critic for Stereophile. &lt;a href="http://velodyneacoustics.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne Acoustics&lt;/a&gt; continues to make high quality speakers that are prized by audiophiles. It was only last year that Velodyne's Lidar operations were spun off into a separate company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Hall revolutionized Lidar design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In autonomous vehicle circles, there is a certain lore around the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, an autonomous vehicle competition sponsored by a division of the US Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2005 event hosted many participants that went on &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/cmu-solves-12-year-old-darpa-grand-challenge-mystery" target="new"&gt;to become&lt;/a&gt; pioneers and leaders in the world of autonomous vehicles. Hall's team didn't win the challenge, but it did make waves with a first-of-its-kind rotating Lidar design. The sensor's software allowed a vehicle to construct a three-dimensional, 360-degree map of its environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was a groundbreaking design, one that Hall patented in 2007, that meant you could not only see and avoid obstacles, you could localize yourself on a real-time map, allowing for navigation, even if you lost GPS," writes Popper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Velodyne has its eyes on more than cars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late last year, Velodyne announced a new product called the Velarray. It's a solid-state Lidar, meaning it doesn't rotate, and will supposedly cost a mere $50. That's a price point that will be nothing short of game-changing if the sensor is up to the task of powering a self-driving car. And according to Hall, it will do even more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When we get the cost down these will be in everything," he told The Verge. "Forklifts, golf carts, anything that can run into something else."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hall's career story is a fascinating one. Even just in his time at Velodyne, he's drastically changed direction more than once. And as his history shows, when he says he and his company are going to do something -- no matter how big -- there's no reason to believe they won't achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Proponents of autonomous vehicles believe that self-driving cars will help cure a bevy of problems that plague our streets, including over a million annual road traffic deaths globally and the unsustainable emission of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may seem like a lesser problem, traffic congestion is interrelated with both issues. Additionally, the time saved by reducing commute times even minimally would amount to a huge societal benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driverless cars could accomplish this and more by traveling at speeds that help traffic flow more smoothly, preventing the "phantom" traffic jams that seem to develop without a clear cause. More efficient traffic flow would be further enhanced by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications that allow cars to signal their intentions to surrounding vehicles and to an overall infrastructure grid so other road actors can react accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few countries suffer from worse traffic congestion than China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2088876/chinas-more-300-million-vehicles-drive-pollution-congestion" target="new"&gt;In 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the number of registered cars in China topped 300 million, nearly matching the number of &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is home to ten of the 25 most congested cities in the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/"target="new"&gt;TomTom Traffic Index&lt;/a&gt;. Self-driving cars could help ease these issues, but until now, China had prohibited testing them on public roads. But in late December, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport announced that companies that have tested driverless cars on private roads can now apply for permission to test on public roads in the Chinese capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, the application process to test a driverless car in Beijing will work similarly to states like California. A Chinese autonomous vehicle company will need to already be registered with the government and must have already performed extensive testing at enclosed facilities. Once approved, all self-driving cars in Beijing will be required to have a human operator behind the wheel, ready to take control of the car if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awarded permits in China will be determined by a council "made up of experts in transportation, telecommunications, automobiles, computer science, and law," Yiting Sun &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609807/china-is-opening-up-city-roads-for-driverless-cars/" target="new"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; at the MIT Technology Review. This determination will be made solely on the federal level, although local municipalities may have a say in which roads and highways will be made available for AV testing. In the US, permits need to be awarded by both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a given state's Department of Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain states in the US have also begun to do away with the absolute requirement that AVs on public roads be attended by a human operator. In October, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737298" target="new"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; became the fifth state to allow companies that have proven their autonomous systems to be highly effective to test "true" driverless cars. Given that this development only came years after driverless cars first began testing on American streets, it may be some time before truly driverless cars are seen on Chinese roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that China is the world's most populous country, the importance of this development can't be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is both an enormous step towards improving safety, transportation accessibility and environmental sustainability in China, and an enormous step in the global advancement of driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;An announcement made by Waymo in November may serve as the single story that best sums up the year 2017 in self-driving car news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; revealed that, in 2018, it would launch &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;a ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; in the Phoenix area using autonomous vehicles without human operators on-board. It would be the first company to do so anywhere, and Waymo wasn't shy in declaring wider implications for the launch of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With Waymo in the driver's seat, we can reimagine many different types of transportation, from ride-hailing and logistics, to public transport and personal vehicles, too," the company &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/with-waymo-in-the-drivers-seat-fully-self-driving-vehicles-can-transform-the-way-we-get-around-75e9622e829a" target="new"&gt;proclaimed&lt;/a&gt;. "We've been exploring each of these areas, with a focus on shared mobility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, 2017 was an exciting year for news surrounding the driverless car. Companies took a major step away from the theoretical and into the concrete, with the announcement of new self-driving projects with real timelines attached to them. So if 2017 was a year of telling for AV developers, 2018 will be a year of showing, according to Roberto Baldwin at Engadget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"2017 was all about the AI hype," Baldwin &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/23/self-driving-cars-2018/" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "In 2018, companies are going to have to start delivering on their promises to make self-driving cars a reality. Because, eventually, our lives will depend on it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entitled "Fragmentation in self-driving cars will eventually be a problem," Baldwin's piece is a meditation on the state of the driverless vehicle industry as the calendar turns. Baldwin believes that technological differentiation from one developer to the next could lead to a confusing and ineffective autonomous landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At some point, autonomous cars will be on the road and if there isn't a federally regulated standard governing how these vehicles interact with the world, there will be chaos as consumers, cities and automakers with competing systems follow slightly different rules," he writes. "For example, if every vehicle treated an intersection differently, the resulting chaos would be no better than when humans are behind the wheel."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that isn't to say that governments should leap in with a series of tightly worded regulations prescribing industry best practices and laws that all cities must follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time being, the AV industry's greatest strength is its diversity. Since anyone is yet to perfect driverless car technology, we have no idea where the game-changing innovations will come from. Competition among major automakers, tech companies and startups is the driving force behind the eventual establishment of industry standards. And as Nvidia senior director of automotive Danny Shapiro told Engadget, overly strict government regulation could stop that innovation in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The autonomous vehicle industry is just getting started, and it's going to be decades and decades of development," Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, keeping an eye on the long game of the driverless car space is the single best perspective for evaluating progress. But as 2018 progresses, industry competition figures to yield a series of exciting new developments for autonomous technology and business structures.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Sometime within the next few years -- no one's sure exactly when -- digital society will upgrade from 4G to 5G wireless networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure is being built right now, with no clear standards yet for speed. But we do know that it will be faster and significantly more reliable, perhaps even replacing WiFi in homes. Plus, it figures to have a wider variety of uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"5G is about more than just shuttling GBs to and from your iPhone more quickly," a 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/what-is-5g-and-when-do-i-get-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; explained. "The 5G revolution will cast a much wider net. It's an information conduit being built to connect self-driving cars, VR headsets, delivery drones, and billions of interconnected devices inside the home."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not a coincidence that the projected timelines for the widespread introduction of driverless cars and the introduction of 5G connectivity seem to intersect around the year 2020. The anticipated speed and reliability of 5G figures to be a significant catalyst in enabling autonomous systems, which will suck up vast amounts of bandwidth, to operate at a high level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of this future, &lt;a href="http://www.lg.com/us" target="new"&gt;LG Electronics&lt;/a&gt; has poured significant resources into becoming a vehicular telematics powerhouse. At the end of 2017, LG announced another move meant to shore up its position, a partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.here.com/en" target="new"&gt;HERE Technologies&lt;/a&gt; to develop a joint offering for high-precision mapping and location services for self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're presenting a new standard for autonomous mobile communication solutions in cooperation with HERE, which has unsurpassed cutting-edge automotive guidance technology," LG executive vice president J.Y. Kim wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lg-electronics-and-here-technologies-partner-on-autonomous-cars-300575395.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "With partners like HERE, LG can continue to advance the next generation of connected car technologies to help prepare automakers for the self-driving era."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HERE is perhaps best known for its HD Live Map, a cloud-based map service that identifies static road signals such as lane markings, stop signs, speed limit signs and traffic lights. The company is developing HD Live Map to integrate with ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) across the platforms of various automakers, optimizing safety for its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LG and HERE will use the underlying technology of HD Live Map in the development of their joint AV mapping platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To operate safely and efficiently, autonomous vehicles will need many kinds of robust data sources and powerful communication technologies," HERE vice president Moon Lee noted. "We believe our Open Location Platform-powered services can play a critical role in next-generation telematics technology for autonomous vehicles, and we're excited to be working with LG to make this a reality."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, HERE was acquired by a consortium of automakers including BMW, Audi and Daimler for $3.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougnewcomb/2016/06/27/inside-audi-bmw-and-daimlers-3-billion-bet-on-heres-mapping-business/#6fff8e176343" target="new"&gt;Forbes reported&lt;/a&gt; at the time, the primary goal of the acquisition was to empower the development and operations of autonomous systems. With the announcement of HERE's partnership with LG, the company appears to be well on its way toward achieving those goals.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The rise of voice assistants such as the Alexa-powered Amazon Echo in recent years has shown the viability of artificial intelligence in the home. It's no secret why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to manifest a thought by simply speaking it out loud is an incredibly powerful, and frictionless, experience. You can put on your favorite music without scrolling through a streaming app. You can set up a reminder for yourself without entering it into a calendar. You can add an item to your grocery list without having a physical grocery list. You can even &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; those very groceries all by uttering a single sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, though, the home is not even the place where a voice assistant has the most potential. Sure, it's a convenience, but putting down what you're doing for a second to perform a task on your computer or phone isn't the worst thing in the world. When you're driving a car, however, a few taps on your phone can become a matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why many experts believe that automobiles represent a more significant growth space for voice assistant technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kia.com/us/en/home" target="new"&gt;Kia&lt;/a&gt; certainly do. The South Korean automakers both plan to launch artificial intelligence-based voice assistant services in select new vehicles beginning in 2019, with a goal of including the technology in all new vehicles by the year 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automakers, which are both part of Hyundai Motor Group, are currently developing a product known as Intelligent Personal Agent that will perform tasks in and out of the vehicle, as well as give users requested information like weather and traffic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Sophisticated voice recognition and AI integration are core to effectively providing drivers with the massive content and data that future connected vehicles have to offer," Hyundai director of infotainment development Paul Choo wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2449" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "These elements play a key role in delivering connected-car-generated information."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is a collaboration with AI company &lt;a href="https://soundhound.com/" target="new"&gt;SoundHound&lt;/a&gt;, and will be based upon the preexisting Houndify platform. The Houndify &lt;a href="https://www.houndify.com/" target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; touts capabilities like "deep meaning understanding," "conversational intelligence" and multilingual text to speech. Companies that already offer products based on the Houndify platform include Yelp, Uber and Expedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We spent a decade developing Houndify, the most advanced voice AI platform, to enable partners the ability to create customized experiences for their products," SoundHound founder and CEO Keyvan Mohajer noted. "We are thrilled to work with Hyundai Motor to revolutionize the in-car experience."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like Amazon Echo owners get the attention of their device with the prompt of "Alexa," future Hyundai owners will activate their car's AI system with the simple phrase "Hi, Hyundai." The list of functions will be extensive. Using their voice, drivers will be able to open and close car doors and change the temperature inside the vehicle. They'll be able to control infotainment systems, setting the destination for a navigation system or queuing up a favorite podcast. They'll even be able to remotely control IoT-connected items in their home like thermostats or security systems. More services are expected to be added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In advance of the 2019 rollout, Hyundai and Kia demonstrated the new AI capabilities of the Intelligent Personal Agent at the CES trade show in Las Vegas in January.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the leaders in the autonomous vehicle race is a never-ending process. Like an actual sporting contest, there are favorites and underdogs, and plenty of movement in and out of both camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google spinoff &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; is unquestionably in the favorites category. This year, Waymo will become the first company to test driverless cars on public roads without a human attendant, and the first company to launch a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; featuring autonomous vehicles exclusively. If Waymo is 1, then GM's autonomous division &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; is 1-A, with &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737210" target="new"&gt;100 driverless cars&lt;/a&gt; many self-driving cars operating in the hectic &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737053" target="new"&gt;streets of San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and more coming soon to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737461" target="new"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency to think of companies such as Waymo, GM and other leaders in the space -- Uber and Tesla -- as singular entities. But the reality is that these are multi-faceted organizations with lots of employees. And as the market for driverless cars has heated up, many of those employees have left big companies to launch their own startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these startups may be smaller in size, they still have huge ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is certainly the case with &lt;a href="https://aurora.tech/" target="new"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Palo Alto outfit has an impressive trio of co-founders, including former Tesla Autopilot leader Sterling Anderson, former head of Google self-driving Chris Urmson, and former Uber AV engineer Drew Bagnell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until the start of the year, Aurora had been operating mostly in stealth mode, but the company kicked off 2018 with &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2018/01/04/from-stealth-to-stardom-ex-google-tesla-uber-robocar-icons-snag-vw-hyundai-deals/#6d586a9a1a65" target="new"&gt;a major announcement&lt;/a&gt; that it was working with both Hyundai and Volkswagen to power the automakers' impending autonomous vehicle projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a sparse website (motto: "We do self-driving cars") that displays a long list of &lt;a href="https://aurora.tech/openings.html#apply" target="new"&gt;job openings&lt;/a&gt; in Palo Alto, San Francisco and Pittsburgh, Aurora isn't exactly shouting from the rooftops about its driverless system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen's announcement of its partnership with the company, though, provides an idea of what the AV veterans Anderson, Urmson and Bagnell have up their sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Specialists from the Volkswagen Group ... have already been working intensively with experts from Aurora to integrate Aurora's self-driving system including sensors, hardware and software, such as Machine Learning and AI technology in Volkswagen Group's vehicle platforms," reads the &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/releases/967" target="new"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;. "With the customer experience at the center of this technology development, the Volkswagen Group is focused on creating new solutions, with the goal of providing best-in-class user experience with a focus on safety, convenience and usability."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen plans to leverage Aurora's technology to build upon its &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736552" target="new"&gt;Sedric concept&lt;/a&gt;. First unveiled in March of 2017, Sedric will represent a "family" of fully autonomous vehicles of various purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Aurora's work with Volkswagen reportedly has been ongoing for about a year, the company's engagement with Hyundai is a more recent development. Hyundai says its goal in working with Aurora is to have Level 4 autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Level 4 autonomy, a driverless system is expected to complete the entirety of most standard drives on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that remains is how close is Aurora to catching its founders' former employers. The Volkswagen and Hyundai news is certainly encouraging. In the future it may not be necessary, or even desirable, for every automaker to have its own autonomous vehicle platform. So collaborating with a third party that provides off-the-shelf solutions like Aurora makes a lot of sense. Volkswagen, for one, seems to see this as just the beginning of an ongoing and fruitful relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Long-term probably only a handful of companies will actually be setting the standard and developing a self-driving system which actually can be delivered into many OEM's vehicles. I personally believe [Aurora] will be one of these," Volkswagen Group Chief Digital Officer Johann Jungwirth told Forbes. "Until now Aurora hasn't been open yet for outside investment. We are very open to that and interested in that. That's all I can say at this time."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;At CES 2018 in Las Vegas, Nvidia -- one of the leading software and hardware companies in the driverless vehicle space -- made it clear that it doesn't take its industry-leading position in autonomous vehicle systems lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Now, we've built PCs, laptops, game consoles, supercomputers and I can tell you, without exception, building a computer for autonomous vehicles is of a level of complexity the world has never known," CEO Jensen Huang &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/01/07/nvidia-captures-pole-position-at-ces-amid-flurry-of-auto-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; a crowd of over 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This computer is on all the time, monitoring all of the sensors that are coming at it," he added. "It can never fail -- it can never fail -- because lives are at stake. And it has to make the right decision, running software the world has never known how to write."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big-time computing capabilities are an under-appreciated aspect of the self-driving car. Nvidia &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/uber-selects-nvidia-technology-to-power-its-self-driving-fleets" target="new"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; autonomous vehicles will require 50 to 100 times as much computing power as the connected cars of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it appears that many in the autonomous vehicle space think Nvidia is up to the challenge. At CES, Huang announced that Nvidia now has a staggering 320 partnerships with other companies in the self-driving car category. While many of the collaborations were previously known, this was the first time Nvidia itself had released a complete tally of them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia also took the opportunity to announce four more collaborations. The company revealed new deals with &lt;a href="http://uber.com/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://volkswagen.com/en.html" target="new"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.zf.com/corporate/en_de/homepage/homepage.html" target="new"&gt;ZF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Baidu_Inc?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index" target="new"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Uber first launched its self-driving Volvo XC90s on Pittsburgh roads in 2015, it used Nvidia GPU computing technology. Now as Uber expands its fleet of self-driving cars and fleet trucks, it will continue to utilize Nvidia technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen plans to leverage the Nvidia Drive IX platform, an AI software development kit, to transform cockpit experiences for drivers and create improved safety features. Features built through Nvidia Drive IX will be incorporated in the forthcoming I.D. Bus, Volkswagen's electric, AI-infused re-imagining of the classic VW Microbus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the car," &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/volkswagen-and-nvidia-to-infuse-ai-into-future-vehicle-lineup" target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess. "Autonomous driving, zero-emission mobility and digital networking are virtually impossible without advances in AI and deep learning. Combining the imagination of Volkswagen with Nvidia, the leader in AI technology, enables us to take a big step into the future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nvidia-ZF-Baidu project is a tricontinental one, as the California software company will be working with the German auto supplier and the Chinese tech giant to combine their proprietary AV technologies to build a single China-specific autonomous vehicle platform. The technologies involved are ZF's ProAI car computer, Baidu's Apollo open driverless platform, and the newly announced Nvidia Drive Xavier, an autonomous machine processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia also announced a deal with Mercedes-Benz. Similar to its project with Volkswagen, Nvidia is partnering with Mercedes-Benz to build a new vehicle cockpit experience, known as MBUX, designed for the driverless age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I want to build the world's most advanced cockpit of the future and it's going to have amazing computer graphics but most important is that it will have artificial intelligence so it can revolutionize the user experience," &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/01/09/mercedes-ces-2018/" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Huang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an overwhelming list of projects for Nvidia, and one that will require time to fully work through. But given the stature of the company's partners, it's safe to say that no roundup of CES "winners" in 2018 will be complete without the inclusion of Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Even among eccentric tech executives, Tesla CEO and Chief Designer Elon Musk stands out. On Tuesday, while Waymo and Uber spent another day squabbling over alleged theft of trade secrets, Musk took the high road -- 400 million miles high, eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A test launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket designed and built by SpaceX, Musk's aerospace startup, carried the Tesla founder's personal Tesla Roadster out beyond the bonds of Earth to eventually orbit around the sun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sports car in Midnight Cherry, an example of the electric car maker's first model, made from 2008 to 2012, isn't quite driverless: It's carrying a space-suited dummy named Starman, in a pleasure-driving pose with one arm resting on top of the convertible's door. (The space suit is SpaceX's own design.) But if the journey goes as planned, the car will find its way around the sun and past Earth and Mars, as long as the hardware and the laws of physics last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its estimated range of 200 miles on a charge only applies on Earth. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;On board the car is also a toy Roadster with its own tiny astronaut, as well as an optical storage device containing Isaac Asimov's &lt;i&gt;Foundation&lt;/i&gt; trilogy of sci-fi novels and a plaque with the names of more than 6,000 SpaceX employees, SpaceX said during a YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c" target="new"&gt;livestream&lt;/a&gt; of the launch. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;SpaceX is streaming &lt;a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXxyXggQenJM" target="new"&gt;live views&lt;/a&gt; of the Roadster online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Roadster isn't the first electric car to leave Earth, as &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/39606-spacex-falcon-heavy-fourth-car-space.html" target="new"&gt;Space.com&lt;/a&gt; points out. The three lunar rovers used on NASA's Apollo missions got there first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the February 6 test launch is to find out how the Falcon Heavy performs. Every rocket needs a payload for realistic testing, and usually it's just a block of cement or some other weighty object that can be placed where the crew or cargo would go. Musk, who no doubt is getting ready to replace his Roadster with one from the &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/roadster" target="new"&gt;new batch&lt;/a&gt; due in 2020 anyway, is just using a payload with a bit more flair. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The car's svelte 2,700-pound curb weight doesn't even begin to simulate all that the Falcon Heavy can carry. It's powerful enough to lift nearly 64 metric tons, or the weight of a fully loaded Boeing 737, into orbit, according to SpaceX. Only the Saturn V, used for the Apollo moon missions in the 1960s and 1970s, has had a greater carrying capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX calls the Falcon Heavy the most powerful operational rocket in the world, with more than 5 million pounds of thrust at lift-off, equal to the power of 18 Boeing 747s. Its three rocket cores contain 27 engines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Falcon Heavy took off from Launch Complex 39A NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral, Fla., the same launchpad the Saturn V used. But unlike the classic NASA rocket, the Falcon Heavy sent at least two of its giant lower stages back to Earth. Those two stages had come back from earlier SpaceX launches and returned together to their designated landing pads to be reused again. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Another stage of the rocket was designed to land on an autonomous barge off the Florida coast. It wasn't clear late Monday whether that maneuver had worked. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;SpaceX built the Falcon Heavy so it could launch bigger satellites and future manned spacecraft. It has already launched multiple supply missions to the International Space Station. Musk's goal is to eventually mount a mission to Mars. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The roadster's trip, which will take it as far as 400 million  kilometers away from Earth at speeds up to 40,000km per hour, may last a billion years, SpaceX says. By then, everyone who pre-ordered a Tesla Model 3 may actually have their cars. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Luxury German car brand Mercedes took the wraps off its 2019 C-Class this week, which has inherited some semi-autonomous vehicle technology from the company's E-Class line of sedans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C-Class, the most successful model series from Mercedes-Benz, features the company's driving assistance systems, offering the driver support and providing for a higher standard of active safety than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/vehicles/passenger-cars/c-class/"target="new"&gt;C-Class&lt;/a&gt; is able to drive semi-autonomously in certain situations and also uses map and navigation data for assistance functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active Distance Assist Distronic, available as part of the driving assistance package, is able to support the driver in numerous situations on the basis of map information and predictively adjust the vehicle's speed when approaching bends, junctions or roundabouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one instance, Distronic can maintain a safe distance to the vehicle ahead when the driver is in congested traffic by automatically maintaining a set desired speed from 12mph upwards, and also keeps a safe distance to the vehicle in front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other new developments include intuitive features like Active Lane Change Assist and Active Emergency Stop Assist, both of which are new functions of Active Steering Assist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active Steering Assist helps the driver in keeping the vehicle in the center of the lane when driving on straight roads or in slight bends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone by Mercedes' February 13 announcement, Nissan recently confirmed rumors, via &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SVNB-0FWJk/"target="new"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, that it will debut its all-new Altima midsized sedan at the 2018 New York Auto Show, which takes place at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with upgraded styling, the company, which has aggressively developing autonomous driving technology, is expected to include at least some self-driving or driver-assisted technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies are just two examples of legacy auto manufacturers hoping to lure consumers with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology company Continental recently a development partner and system integrator of the collaboration between BMW, Intel and Mobileye for automated driving, while Audi is bringing what it claims is a world first to its 2019 A8 luxury sedan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audi's Traffic Jam Pilot has been specifically &lt;a href="https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/presskits/techday-piloted-driving-9181/"target="new"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; for SAE Level 3 automated driving, which means the driver no longer has to monitor the surroundings continuously and that the vehicle system will alert the driver when he or she needs to retake control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system handles starting from a stop, accelerating, steering and braking in its lane, and the company claims the technology can also handle demanding situations such as vehicles cutting in closely in front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The control signals that the Audi AI traffic jam pilot requires for conditional automated driving are obtained from the central driver assistance controller and from a redundant data fusion in the radar control unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time global automakers are investing heavily in ADAS and automated vehicle technology, the US Department of Transportation (DoT) is &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740497&amp;"target="new"&gt;gearing up to solicit feedback&lt;/a&gt; regarding regulations for self-driving vehicle technology, including a public meeting on March 1 that would seek input regarding various autonomous features and advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoT &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/regulations-fr/notices/2018-02738/"target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the objectives of the public meeting are primarily to get feedback on the draft AV 3.0 Framework and identify priority federal and non-federal activities that can accelerate the safe rollout of AVs.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;With California and Arizona hosting advanced tests for self-driving vehicles, and Washington DC's mayor paving the way for self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles, other states are ramping up their efforts to respond to the burgeoning technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Massachusetts held a statehouse briefing on autonomous vehicles to explore the concerns and benefits of introducing self-driving vehicles to the state's roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the topics discussed were possibilities of lower emissions, increased public space and reduced traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If you want one fact on transportation, it's this: U.S. News &amp; World report ranked us the No. 1 state in the country across all categories, including being No. 1 in education and No. 2 in health care. We were No. 45 in transportation. We have a lot of work to do," Chris Dempsey, executive director of Transportation for Massachusetts, said in remarks &lt;a href="http://www.gazettenet.com/Autonomous-vehicles-may-be-on-Mass-roads-soon-15595287/"target="new"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by the Daily Hampshire Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The embrace of self-driving vehicles would also require investment in the state's physical infrastructure, such as repairing roads and bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The February 15 meeting followed a report from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) &lt;a href="https://www.mapc.org/farechoices/"target="new"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, which found ride-hailing services such as Lyft and Uber were actually making traffic in Boston worse, as many of the people using the services would have otherwise taken public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These transformations may become even more profound if widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles makes on-demand mobility even less expensive and more efficient," the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, the state's governor Charlie Baker &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-baker-creates-commission-on-the-future-of-transportation-in-the-commonwealth/"target="new"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Executive Order No. 579 establishing the commission on the Future of Transportation in the Commonwealth to advise the Baker-Polito Administration on future transportation needs and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governor named 18 appointees to the commission, which will develop a range of scenarios anticipated between 2020 and 2040 and be used to inform the panel's findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission will meet monthly and will provide a report on the analysis of members and make recommendations by December 1, of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation (MTF) President Eileen McAnneny, who will serve on the commission, said in a statement that its creation reflects MTF's recent report stressing how transportation is undergoing disruptive change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indiana, a state senate committee took testimony Tuesday on &lt;a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2018/bills/house/1341/"target="new"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; to regulate autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill proposes a series of regulations guided by oversight panels compromised of state departments of insurance and transportation leaders, and would also bar local governments from banning self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The proposed legislation has divided industry groups, with some questioning the safety of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How are [autonomous vehicles] going to react when they come into a construction zone and you have a 180-pound man who is working a couple feet from 55 mile-an-hour traffic?" Operating Engineers Union leader Todd Vandermyd &lt;a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/industry-groups-divided-selfdriving-car-regulations-bill-140773/"target="new"&gt; questioned &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the nation's capital this week, Mayor Muriel Bowser &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740544&amp;"target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new agency that will help prepare the city, its residents as well as the streets, for autonomous vehicle testing and other developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Interagency AV Working Group is made up of representatives from other city agencies that focus on transportation, disability rights, environmental issues and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency's first task is to create a proposal to test autonomous and self-driving vehicles on 10th Street, SW, near the L'Enfant Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen's concept car -- I.D. Vizzion -- a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel, will debut at the 88th International Motor Show in Geneva in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the reveal of its first all-electric vehicles in the new I.D. family, the company now plans to show off, for the first time,  &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/detailpage/-/detail/World-premiere-of-the-ID-VIZZION-in-Geneva-Volkswagen-shows-the-potential-of-its-new-range-of-IDmodels/view/6263949/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da?p_p_auth=kYDRWB9n/"target="new"&gt;its concept&lt;/a&gt; for a fully autonomous car that also uses electric power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept car lacks a steering wheel or visible controls, and the vehicle -- or others designed like it -- would be aimed at customer groups who cannot drive because of their age or other factors.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The Vizzion is the fourth member of the Volkswagen I.D. family, and features a 111 kWh lithium-ion battery, enabling a driving range of up to 415 miles, when braking regeneration is factored in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on its intelligent management, the two electric motors cooperate with maximum efficiency and drive all four wheels of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the kick-off of the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the auto manufacturer and tech giant Nvidia showcased the future of artificial intelligence in consumer vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of this announcement included the I.D. Buzz -- another part of the I.D. family. Volkswagen will use the Buzz as part of its electric car campaign, which will then gradually introduce autonomous driving capabilities starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One potential outcome of AI infusion into Volkswagen I.D. Buzz are what the company calls Intelligent Co-Pilot capabilities, which will include convenience and driver assistance systems based on processing sensor data from both inside and outside of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The systems can be enhanced throughout the life of the vehicle through software updates, and can gain new capabilities as further developments are made in autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to deep learning, this VW will learn to accurately assess situations and analyze the behavior of others on the road, enabling it to make the right decisions, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the Nvidia Drive IX Intelligent Experience platform, AI-enabled features such as facial recognition for unlocking the vehicle from the outside, driver alerts for bicycles, gesture recognition for user controls, natural language understanding for voice control and gaze tracking for driver distraction alerts are all possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Buzz will be followed by a new electric SUV, the I.D. Crozz. After that debut, more than 20 fully electric vehicles are planned by 2025 toward its goal of becoming the world leader in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models based on the Modular Electrification Toolkit (MEB) architecture are planned to offer the latest driver assistance systems to be prepared for the respective levels of autonomous driving that are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MEB electronic systems will also be gradually introduced to vehicles with conventional drive systems that are based on the MQB (Modularer Querbaukasten -- German for Modular Transverse Matrix) architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2017/03/Autonomous_driving.html/"target="new"&gt;showed off&lt;/a&gt; its Sedric self-driving concept car, which is the first vehicle from the company to have been created for Level 5 of autonomous driving, which means a person as a human driver is no longer required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also designed without a steering wheel or pedals, the Sedric could point the way to future interior design cues for autonomous vehicles -- the car acts more like a lounge than a traditional four-wheeled car, with sofa-like seats, large window surfaces and transparent high-resolution OLED screen, which allows passengers to look out at the front.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There's no stress-free way to get around Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city's public transportation systems are short on maintenance and heavy on passengers. Sidewalks are overcrowded, too, so much so that many New Yorkers choose to walk in the street itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the roads, of course, are no less congested with cars. It's not uncommon to watch the same traffic light cycle from green to yellow to red three times before actually making it through an intersection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say New York City could benefit from any development that relieves traffic in its many forms. The self-driving car has long been viewed as a possible solution in the future, but the city has been largely resistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that GM's autonomous vehicle subsidiary &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; would begin testing Level 4 self-driving cars in New York City early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruise has already begun the process of mapping a geofenced section of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Autonomous vehicles have the potential to save time and save lives, and we are proud to be working with GM and Cruise on the future of this exciting new technology," Cuomo noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-cruise-automation-applying-begin-first-fully-autonomous-vehicle" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The spirit of innovation is what defines New York, and we are positioned on the forefront of this emerging industry that has the potential to be the next great technological advance that moves our economy and moves us forward."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement represents a large step for New York, which had previously  taken a fairly conservative approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislation is part of a program in the state's fiscal year 2018 budget that allows for approved testers to operate through April 2018. With Cruise's testing reportedly starting "early" in 2018, the company would have four months of testing at most before having to apply for the ability to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Empire State is also taking the additional step of requiring that two Cruise operators monitor the cars from inside during testing. Most states require one, and a few have eliminated the requirement for in-vehicle operators altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Cruise, New York City certainly represents one of the best cities in the world to pursue one of its goals: testing vehicles in the most chaotic circumstances possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Testing in the hardest places first means we'll get to scale faster than starting with the easier ones," CEO Kyle Vogt wrote in a recent &lt;a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/why-testing-self-driving-cars-in-sf-is-challenging-but-necessary-77dbe8345927" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; about testing Cruise vehicles in San Francisco. "This may seem counter-intuitive, but by testing in densely populated areas we expose our software to unusual situations at a much higher rate, which means we can improve our software at a much higher rate. Based on our experience, every minute of testing in San Francisco is about as valuable as an hour of testing in the suburbs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruise operates a fleet of 100 driverless Chevy Bolts in San Francisco, where the company is headquartered. According to Cuomo, the company will also open an office in New York. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Passing legislation that will govern the operation of self-driving cars on public roads is a formidable task, even compared to the normally tedious process of creating new laws in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, there are an endless number of interests to be considered: OEMs who want to develop and sell their products; truckers and their unions that want to protect jobs; and tech companies that think regulation is the enemy of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, there's the best interest of the American people, but even that is muddled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicles could improve the safety of citizens in the long term, but in the short term those new technologies actually run the risk of jeopardizing that safety. Perhaps the most challenging aspect is the vast amount of unknowns. How do you write laws to govern a world that doesn't exist yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is daunting, the need for autonomous vehicles laws is becoming more and more necessary as technology advances with each passing year. Lawmakers want to get rules on the books to govern the industry before the horse gets too far out of the barn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently AV bills made it out of committee with a great deal of support in both the House and the Senate. But according to a report by &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/362883-driverless-car-bill-hits-senate-speed-bump" target="new"&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt;, the Senate bill, known as the American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies (AV START) Act, may undergo some changes before its sponsors are ready to introduce it to a vote in the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Bill sponsors hope to iron out some of the kinks over the next few weeks, but it's unclear whether major sticking points, such as concerns over safety and trucks being excluded from the legislation, can be easily resolved," The Hill reported. "The Senate is also facing a tight timeline and daunting to-do list before the end of this year, including spending bills and a major tax overhaul."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislation is currently going through a process known as "hotlining." The term refers to bill sponsors getting feedback from other senators and making revisions to help ensure the legislation has the votes needed before bringing it to a vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Some folks have some holds on it. There are some folks who have some issues," US Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) told The Hill. Peters is one of the bill's two co-sponsors along with South Dakota Republican John Thune. "We're going to keep working on it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SCourtneyDC/status/936674671264661505" target="new"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) are among the lawmakers with holds on the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foremost goal of the AV START act is to widen opportunities for driverless car testing, largely by limiting the ability of individual states to regulate it within their own borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) allows exemption permits for 5,000 self-driving cars to be on public roads every year. The Senate bill proposes widening this number to 25,000, and ultimately increasing it to 100,000 within three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also seeks to organize various committees to ensure that AV technology lives up to its society-helping potential, including a group to establish methods for improving transportation opportunities for the elderly and disabled.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Connected cars open up a wide range of possibilities for drivers and passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive, coffee-stained road atlas has become a thing of the past as GPS navigation systems make getting from A to B far easier than ever before. Music and podcast streaming services no longer live exclusively on a phone and can now be selected seamlessly through a car's infotainment system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing these connected car advancements does run the risk of contributing to distracted driving. But when used safely, they can make the driving experience more enjoyable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, shopping has been excluded from the connected car experience. Now, however, General Motors is looking to change that with a new product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;'s Marketplace is a commerce platform where drivers can make reservations, place orders ahead of time and pay for goods or services from the comfort of the driver's seat. The partner brands at launch include retail chains, restaurants, gas stations and travel services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The average American spends 46 minutes per day on the road driving. Leveraging connectivity and our unique data capabilities, we have an opportunity to make every trip more productive and give our customers time back," GM Vice President Santiago Chamorro wrote in a &lt;a href="http://www.gm.com/mol/m-2017-dec-1205-marketplace.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "For most retailers and consumer brands the daily commute is the only time not accessible in a consumers' day."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WysXyfRbC_M" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select 2017 and 2018 model-year Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles will have Marketplace installed into their infotainment systems through 4G LTE connectivity. And GM owners will be able to buy 4G LTE data packages and renew OnStar subscriptions through Marketplace, which will not require a separate data plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies that will be participating in the platform include Dunkin Donuts and Wingstop, which will allow customers to order ahead and pay for what they want, thus cutting down on wait times. TGI Fridays patrons will be able to book a reservation through Marketplace. Both Shell and ExxonMobil are participating and will alert drivers of the nearest service station and provide a description of the amenities offered at each one. The parking app Parkopia will allow customers to find, reserve and pay for a spot at participating garages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken individually, these could be seen as providing only minor benefits. But collectively, they offer the chance to remove key points of friction from a driver's day, which could make a big impact on a person's overall outlook.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is something that should be on everyone's radar regardless of what industry they work in. While it's easy to be rendered numb by the day-in, day-out news of hacks and private information leaks from banks, online retailers and more, those instances only highlight how important it is remain vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity issue is of particular importance to the automotive industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connected cars are already on the road in great numbers, and like anything else tethered to a network, the vehicles offer hackers an opportunity to access compromising data remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infotainment systems on connected cars include things like location services and perhaps personal information like credit card numbers. A hacker might even be able to access a driver's phone if it is connected to the infotainment system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As concerning as a data breach is, what's even scarier is that someone might be able to remotely access a vehicle's driving functionality and use it to cause harm. It's a terrifying scenario, which is why it needs to be addressed head on. Connected car companies need to constantly be on guard against the worst-case scenario, because the reality is that hackers have already imagined something even worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One company focused on connected car cybersecurity is &lt;a href="https://us.blackberry.com/" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt;. After seeing its position in the smartphone market diminish considerably, Blackberry has found new success in the automotive sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company recently showed its leadership by publishing &lt;a href="https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/7-pillars-automotive-cybersecurity" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry's 7-Pillar Recommendation for Automotive Cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; that proposed industry-wide guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper was authored by BlackBerry Technology Solutions president Sandeep Chennakeshu and outlined seven principles for the protection of connected cars: secure the supply chain; use trusted components; employ isolation and trusted messaging; conduct in-field health checks; create a rapid incident response network; use a lifecycle management system; and make safety and security a part of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Protecting a car from cybersecurity threats requires a holistic approach," &lt;a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/blackberry-outlines-framework-to-secure-connected-and-autonomous-vehicles-nyse-bb-2242809.htm" target="new"&gt;Chennakeshu&lt;/a&gt; noted in a statement. "Leveraging our experience as a leader in cybersecurity and embedded automotive software, BlackBerry has created a recommended framework to protect cars from cybersecurity threats. If followed, we believe vehicles will not only be secure but BlackBerry Secure."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining cybersecurity best practices is an extremely difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology is constantly evolving and as soon as one hole is patched, hackers find another one to exploit. As the Internet of Things takes on a growing and more crucial role in society, it isn't just companies like BlackBerry that are looking to protect connected products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, the US Department of Transportation &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736369" target="new"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; a set of guidelines for autonomous driving systems. The plan is broader than BlackBerry's guidelines, and while it pertains specifically to the self-driving car, it recognizes the importance that vehicle cybersecurity will play in the future of mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"NHTSA encourages entities to document how they incorporated vehicle cybersecurity considerations into ADSs, including all actions, changes, design choices, analyses, and associated testing, and ensure that data is traceable within a robust document version control environment," according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf" target="new"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a business that stands to profit off of better-defined vehicle cybersecurity regulations, BlackBerry has an obvious self-interest in setting the industry standards. Regardless of who writes the rules, however, there is a clear need for industry standards to be established. But they also need to be flexible. Because as connected cars evolve, so will the ways that hackers try to attack them. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In the world of startups, "stealth mode" refers to companies that develop a product with zero public profile whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice has become increasingly popular in recent years. One of the advantages of operating in secrecy is that it prevents competitors, especially large companies with abundant resources, from putting those resources to use in order to copy and scale a similar product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stealth mode also helps a startup make a huge bang when it comes out of the shadows. And then there's the advantage of not having to adhere to publicly announced timelines or show off new technology before it's complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of autonomous vehicles, few companies come out of stealth mode with the same momentum as &lt;a href="https://www.ouster.io/" target="new"&gt;Ouster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Lidar company not only came out of stealth mode with the announcement that it had received a whopping $27 million in funding from investors such as Cox Enterprises and Amity Ventures, but Ouster also said that its 64-laser Lidar sensor, the OS1, is 60 times lighter, 30 times smaller and three times more energy efficient than the &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt; HDL-64 Lidar, which is the current industry standard. Perhaps most importantly, at $12,000, Ouster's Lidar is six times cheaper than Velodyne's, and it's available for purchase right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ouster CEO and Co-Founder Angus Pacala told &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/12/11/robocar-lidar-startup-ouster-has-a-novel-pitch-you-can-buy-our-sensor-now/#3d1b539655fe" target="new"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, there has been a lot of talk about improving Lidar and lowering its price, but it hasn't gone beyond talk. He explained his company's rationale for remaining in stealth mode as a desire to make sure it could walk the walk before it talked the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we have a device that's on the market... is a really big deal very few other companies can claim," Pacala said. "Most companies are making the claim that they'll have something at some point, but they don't have anything now. We've really tried to avoid hyping the company or the products before they're available... to reverse this trend of brinksmanship when it comes to Lidar."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouster says that it will begin manufacturing up to 1,000 units of the OS1 per month at its San Francisco factory beginning in January 2018 and hopes to ramp that number up to 10,000 units per month by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pacala says that some early customers have already begun receiving their Lidars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually the foundation of an autonomous vehicle's sensor suite, Lidar sensors shoot out thousands of laser pulses per second, bouncing them off of surrounding objects. The speed with which a given pulse bounces back to the sensor allows accompanying software systems to construct a sort of three-dimensional map of its surroundings, telling the self-driving system what is around it and how fast it is traveling. In its early iterations, Lidar sensors became known for their "coffee can" shape atop self-driving prototypes; Pacala says the Ouster OS1 Lidar is half the size of a coffee &lt;em&gt;mug&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ouster claims the resolution of its Lidar matches that of the HDL-64, that may be an outdated standard. In November, Velodyne announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738731" target="new"&gt;set to begin production&lt;/a&gt; on the VLS-128, a Lidar product with twice as many lasers and significantly higher resolution. But the HDL-64 already retails for over $70,000, so it stands to reason that the new and improved version will cost even more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, now that Pacala's company is out of stealth mode, it still has to show customers that its Lidar does what he says it does. But if Ouster can match the capabilities of the HDL-64 at one sixth the price while being smaller and more efficient, it could potentially challenge Velodyne for Lidar supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;While they exist in varying degrees, there are really only two fundamental problems that a tech product can have: it doesn't work or it can't be acquired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every new piece of technology that gets released claims to solve some problem, but if it doesn't do that or can't be purchased, it's a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Lidar sensors that underpin the majority of self-driving cars right now, both issues exist to a degree. Lidar technology &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work, but some argue it is not sophisticated enough to be reliable for vehicles traveling at highway speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while Lidar sensors can be purchased, they come at a very steep price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost is so high that many industry insiders say that autonomous vehicles won't become a viable mobility option until the price comes down significantly. Talk of how to make Lidar better and cheaper dominates the self-driving car news cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where there's a widely acknowledged problem, there are sure to be a wide swath of companies looking to solve it, and profit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those is &lt;a href="http://www.tetravue.com/" target="new"&gt;TetraVue&lt;/a&gt;, a startup based in Vista, Calif. TetraVue is focusing its efforts on a form of Lidar, known as flash Lidar, that would be new to the consumer AV industry. The traditional Lidar sensors that power most of the self-driving cars of today operate by moving and sending out millions of laser pulses per second. Flash Lidar sensors, on the other hand, take a "snapshot" of a vehicle's surroundings in such a way that a 2D image is transformed into a 3D one and still delivers range information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash lidar is essentially a hybrid of standard Lidar sensors and video cameras. The data from a flash Lidar provides an autonomous operating system with a three-dimensional, high-resolution feed of its surroundings. Tetravue CEO Hal Zarem told &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/tetravue-says-its-lidar-will-dominate-the-robocar-business" target="new"&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that he thinks his company can replace traditional Lidars and reduce the role of radar and cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all this means little without knowing how much a flash Lidar will cost, and TetraVue has yet to release any pricing information. Flash Lidars are not new. They have been used for military applications for quite some time. In those situations, money is no object. Consumer applications are a different story. But Zarem says the TetraVue flash Lidar sensors will be affordable compared with traditional, high-end Lidars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In mass production, we think we can get to the cost points the industry requires, on the order of a few hundred dollars," Zarem told IEEE Spectrum. For comparison, the &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt; HDL-64 Lidar, which is as close to an industry standard as there is right now, retails for around $70,000, and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738731" target="new"&gt;a newer model&lt;/a&gt;, with twice the lasers has already been announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, TetraVue announced a &lt;a href="http://www.hatch-mag.com/2017/02/21/startup-buzz-tetravue-raises-10-million/" target="new"&gt;$10 million Series A&lt;/a&gt; round of fundraising led by Robert Bosch Venture Capital and Nautilus Venture Partners. The money was raised to further develop its flash Lidar. The device is apparently far enough along that TetraVue &lt;a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/14/1262004/0/en/TetraVue-Debuts-First-Long-Range-High-Resolution-4D-Camera-at-CES-2018.html" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would debut the product at the CES 2018 trade show in Las Vegas in January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its announcement, TetraVue wasn't shy about the new product's potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This new camera technology is poised to transform markets including autonomous vehicles, machine vision, factory automation and the entertainment industry," according to TetraVue.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, Boston's Seaport district originally evolved around shipping. But based on recent developments, it may eventually need to be renamed Boston's Driverless Carport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738961" target="new"&gt;Early in December&lt;/a&gt;, ride-hailing company &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; and Boston-based autonomous vehicle developer &lt;a href="http://www.nutonomy.com/" target="new"&gt;NuTonomy&lt;/a&gt; announced a new initiative to offer rides in driverless cars to Lyft customers in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After placing orders for a ride through the Lyft app like normal, a select number of passengers will be notified that their driver will not be a driver at all, at least in the human sense. Instead, one of NuTonomy's driverless cars will pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, Delphi Automotive (&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736848" target="new"&gt;now known&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="http://www.aptiv.com/" target="new"&gt;Aptiv&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737696" target="new"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; NuTonomy for $450 million to further bolster its self-driving car pursuits. It appears Aptiv has taken a liking to NuTonomy's hometown because in mid-December Aptiv announced that that it had opened a new technology center in the same Boston Seaport neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Boston has become a leading global city for the development of autonomous driving solutions, making it the ideal location for our new technology center," Aptiv President and CEO Kevin Clark wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aptiv-opens-boston-technology-center-300570192.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We look forward to working closely with Mayor [Marty] Walsh and Boston's world-class research centers and talent base to move mobility forward in the City and across the globe."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home to some of the world's best engineering universities --including MIT, where NuTonomy got its start -- Boston has become one of the preeminent sites for autonomous vehicle companies on the east coast. The city is embracing its new identity. &lt;a href="https://imagine.boston.gov/" target="new"&gt;Imagine Boston 2030&lt;/a&gt; is a citywide plan to grow the economy while improving quality of life and neighborhood vitality for all citizens. &lt;a href="http://goboston2030.org/en/" target="new"&gt;Go Boston 2030&lt;/a&gt; is a transportation-specific urban planning initiative to bolster access to and from all parts of the city. In his comments on Aptiv's new technology center, Mayor Walsh contextualized how greeting AV developers with open arms fits into both of these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A year ago, I issued an executive order that welcomed researchers and companies to Boston, inviting them to explore how autonomous vehicle technology can help further our transportation goals of safety, access, and reliability, as outlined in Boston's long-term plans Imagine Boston 2030 and 'Go Boston 2030,'" Boston Mayor Marty Walsh noted in the same statement. "We are pleased that Aptiv will locate their new mobility innovation center in Boston, tapping into the wealth of talent here and strengthening Boston's role as a leader in innovation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boston's winding layout was not originally designed with facilitated transportation as a top priority. And &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/10/17/driverless-cars-could-cut-down-boston-awful-traffic-report-says/qrvBumihSXXwNalyCk15QP/story.html" target="new"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that the city could see a serious reduction in traffic congestion with the introduction of self-driving cars. Plus, as &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; CEO Kyle Vogt &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737053" target="new"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; in a recent post about his company's testing in San Francisco, AV systems learn at a significantly faster rate when they're driving around chaotic city streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Aptiv, NuTonomy and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738143" target="new"&gt;other developers&lt;/a&gt; testing autonomous vehicles in Boston, it's an exciting opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long, the old Boston joke about having to "pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd" may refer to a self-driving "cah."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A bill moving through the Utah legislature would legalize self-driving cars across the state and set up licensing, registration and insurance rules for them.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;House Bill &lt;a href=" https://le.utah.gov/~2018/bills/static/HB0371.html" target="new"&gt;371&lt;/a&gt;, which a legislative committee endorsed and sent to the full House of Representatives on Wednesday, February 21, could make Utah a leading state in allowing autonomous vehicles to roam across urban and rural areas. Under the proposed law, local governments couldn't impose their own regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utah is the 13th largest state by area, spanning sparsely populated deserts and snowy mountains -- a particular challenge for fledgling robot drivers -- as well as the sprawling Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Robert Spendlove, a Republican from Sandy, says it could help the state's growing technology sector to take the lead in self-driving cars, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/02/22/utah-soon-could-be-first-state-to-fully-legalize-self-driving-cars-on-its-roads/" target="new"&gt;Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporters say allowing self-driving cars will help to make roads safer because robot cars don't run red lights, drive drunk or text while driving. (Surveys suggest consumers &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740775&amp;" target="new"&gt;haven't quite bought&lt;/a&gt; the safety argument yet.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spendlove's bill would set up a standard way for owners to register and insure autonomous cars. It would also make sure crashes are handled the same way when there's no driver behind the wheel: The self-driving car would have to remain at the scene, just like a human driver does, and the car's owner would have to report the crash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill will define different rules for each level of autonomous technology, from Level 1 systems like adaptive cruise control to future Level 5 vehicles that won't need a driver, pedals or a steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it mostly amends existing laws, it's an ambitious measure on a technology that's still evolving and controversial. Spendlove has said he may put off the bill's effective date until the middle of next year to allow for more work on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promise of tech investment and the prospect of driverless vehicles hitting the road in the next few years are leading many states to craft laws and programs to deal with these cars. This month, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740650" target="new"&gt;Massachusetts and Indiana&lt;/a&gt; have debated autonomous vehicle regulation and the District of Columbia has created an agency to prepare for testing and other developments. Legislatures in five states have passed laws on autonomous vehicles, and 30 others have considered legislation, according to the &lt;a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Automated_Driving:_Legislative_and_Regulatory_Action" target="new"&gt;Center for Internet and Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Some proponents of the technology say the growing patchwork of laws could hamper the industry, and the federal government is trying to step in with &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740572" target="new"&gt;national regulations&lt;/a&gt;. But states that step forward may stand to gain. &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Arizona, which is home to some chipmaking operations but not one of the country's biggest tech or car hubs, has become a hotbed of self-driving activity since its governor gave an executive order on autonomous vehicles in 2015. Late last month, the state gave Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740723&amp;" target="new"&gt; license to operate&lt;/a&gt; a car-for-hire service with its driverless minivans. Waymo's operations so far have been focused on the greater Phoenix area. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Digital technology services specialist UST Global and Net4Things, an Internet of Things (IoT) company targeting service providers, have partnered to develop the connected car market in Europe and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a special focus in Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ust-global-and-net4things-sign-partnership-to-deploy-connected-car-675129763.html"target="new"&gt;the two companies will offer complementary  IoT technologies&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the connected car market. The two officially inked their partnership at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on February 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service providers will be able to receive consulting services and support from UST Global when launching a new business line, and the two companies are promising an end-to-end joint solution for a customer that can be launched in less than ten weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Net4Things Global Connected Car Platform (N4T GCCP) helps enable wireless carriers to be part of the connected car ecosystem, by linking them to smart advertising, insurance telematics, remote diagnosis, booking, e-call and infotainment and into other potential revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, which is based in Madrid, also offers a module that allows service providers to assemble an accident recreation through the Net4Things Instant Crash Report, which the firm said could reduce fraud and improve safety on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UST Global, which is headquartered in Aliso Viejo, Calif., and operates in 25 countries, recently acquired Pneuron a startup that helps customers build, deploy and run applications that require components from widely diverse sets of platforms and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other connected car partnership &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zubie-inc-partners-with-xirgo-technologies-to-expand-coverage-of-connected-car-market-300604495.html/"target="new"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, Zubie, a connected vehicle platform provider, announced it has partnered with Xirgo Technologies, a hardware provider in the telematics industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal will bring together Zubie's connected car platform with Xirgo's expertise in hardware customization for the transportation industry, expanding the range of solutions that Zubie can deliver into tracking for fleets of all sizes, heavy duty truck tracking and asset tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's web, iOS and Android applications offer insight to their clients across four pillars of connectivity -- vehicle location, vehicle health and diagnostic information, driver safety and trip management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Zubie platform was designed for businesses with small and medium sized fleets of two to 200 vehicles, it is also available for individuals and families who want the benefits of a connected car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the benefits of the Zubie platform will now be accessible through Xirgo devices, such as live location tracking, curfew scheduling, detailed trip history, geofence alerts, point-of-interest reporting and dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zubie also offers driver behavior analysis such as alerts and reports for safety infractions and fuel efficiency and vehicle health management data including check engine light diagnosis, battery level monitoring and preventative maintenance reminders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Map and trip time, mileage, top speed, hard brakes, hard accelerations, speed, idle time and fuel cost, the ability to categorize of trips for business expenses and tax deductions and on-demand tow truck network for quick assistance are additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the feature set is a fuel finder component that will find the location of the cheapest gas near the driver, and integration with platforms like Fleetio, Expensify, IFTTT and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zubie had previously joined forces with RepairPal to offer real-time car repair information and access to certified repair shops, and in November 2017 announced it had tracked one billion miles for its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>A new study by the University of Michigan shows that the components and computer power to operate connected and fully autonomous vehicles could eliminate their benefits, specifically by creating more pollution than conventional cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when the world switches to 100% renewable energy will the environmental benefits of electric and connected cars be achieved,
&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b04576"target="new"&gt;according to researchers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper, published by researchers at the University of Michigan and the Ford Motor Innovation Center in February, shows that autonomous cars could have a substantial energy toll, effectively making them more polluting than current manually driven vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their results the researchers used the 2015 US average mix for electricity generation: 34% coal, 32% natural gas, 20% nuclear, 6% hydro, 5% wind, and 3% other renewables including solar. The team tested several vehicles, including the Tesla Model S, the Ford Fusion and Waymo's Chrysler Pacifica. 

&lt;p&gt;The technology installed in connected vehicles and the infrastructure -- such as Vehicle-to-Everything technologies -- require a significant amount of power to operate. The results indicate that connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) subsystems could increase vehicle energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 3% to 20% due to electronics power consumption, weight, drag, and data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study identifies four factors in using connected and autonomous vehicles that contribute to more energy use:&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CAV components increase energy consumption. In the Tesla Model S, the &lt;a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/drive-px/"target="new"&gt;Nvidia Drive PX2&lt;/a&gt; uses 96W of power, and the &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/hdl-64e.html"target="new"&gt;Velodine HDL-64E Lidar&lt;/a&gt; another 60W. Total power usage of the AV electronics exceeds 200W.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The components increase the weight of the vehicle -- adding four to ten kilograms (kgs) depending on configuration -- pushing up its fuel or power use. In the case of combustion-engine connected vehicles that could add from 0.073 to 0.27 liters per 100 kilometers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exterior-mounted components increase the aerodynamic drag. A small roof rack mounted on a passenger car can increase fuel consumption by 0.5%. A large roof rack, such as the Velodine, can impact fuel economy by as much as 15%.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Data transmission can have an impact on the power use of the cellular networks. The researchers estimate that connected vehicles will use about 1.4MB/mile driven, based on data usage from map applications. A conservative estimate is that a light vehicle will use about 200GB over its lifetime. That will correspond to 275 Megajoules of power including the consumption of the basestation, telecom network, and data centers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"GHG emissions increase by 2.8&amp;#8722;4.0% after the addition of a small or medium CAV subsystem to a platform vehicle. This modest increase rises to a significant impact of approximately 20% with a large subsystem," according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional concern is the potential increase of car use because of convenience. Autonomous cars could encourage people to engage in longer commutes, as they won't need to drive or park the cars, making public transport even less appealing than it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The arrival of autonomous cars will increase the Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), reverse the millennial trend eschewing driving, [and] decimate public transport," said former NYC Traffic Commissioner Samuel Schwartz -- a.k.a. Gridlock Sam -- during a conference in Barcelona in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/evMKn20T2Uo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"There could be a rebound effect. They could induce travel, adding to congestion and fuel use," Greg Keoleian, the senior author, &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/exposing-the-power-vampires-in-self-driving-cars"target="new"&gt;wrote in the study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are considerable advances in technology that could reduce the power consumption over the next few years, such as 5G networks and optimized components, vehicles manufactured today will be operating for many years, and their electronics will continue to draw power the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We knew there was going to be a tradeoff in terms of the energy and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the equipment and the benefits gained from operational efficiency. I was surprised that it was so significant," Keoleian wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) &lt;a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/67216.pdf"target="new"&gt;reported in November 2016&lt;/a&gt; that "projected energy use reaching as low as less than 40% and as high as three times the current level of U.S. [light-duty vehicle] LDV fuel consumption," when factoring CAV technology adoption.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"CAVs are a disruptive technology that will likely transform personal mobility and the built urban landscape in the coming decades  Some effects such as shared mobility and optimized routing will decrease energy use and emissions, while other effects such as increased mobility demand will increase energy use and emissions," the Michigan study concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Security is shaping up to be a major concern not only among industry players and OEMs in the connected car space, with companies such as Arilou Information Security Technologies offering technologies to secure Ethernet connectivity in connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hungarian security specialist, part of the NNG Group, has launched the Ethernet Security Hub, which acts as a translator to bridge gaps between various electronic systems in the vehicle and allow them to securely communicate with each other, even if they were not originally intended to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology allows operators and owners to granularly control the vehicle's GPS transmitter, for instance restricting transmission of the car's location so that it only sends location information when an accident occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reduces the amount of information transmitted from the vehicle through the cloud, which could help prevent attacks on in-vehicle communication systems, while also adding to driver privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Ethernet Security Hub provides not only comprehensive control of the communication channels, but also better identifies hack attempts, and allows drivers to maintain control in the event of an attack," Arilou founder and CEO Ziv Levi wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.nng.com/newsroom/press-releases/arilou-develops-first-kind-technology-automotive-ethernet/"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also claims the Ethernet Security Hub would not interfere with the rest of the vehicle's Ethernet capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The technology is flexible and can be configured to fit the individual system architectures of any OEM vehicle, including heavy-duty trucks and buses as well as other modes of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is betting Automotive Ethernet will continue to be the preferred form of communication for data heavy communications systems in connected vehicles, which require greater bandwidth to transmit data at the speeds necessary to maintain driver safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arilou is not the only player in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argus' automotive cyber security division develops technologies for vehicles enabling connectivity features while protecting vehicles from hackers, as do Cisco and Harman's TowerSec division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automotive Ethernet, a flavor of regular Ethernet, is designed to offer cars greater bandwidth than their usual CAN and LIN networks, offering speeds of up to 100 Mb/s in its current form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IEEE802.3 working group, which is responsible for Automotive Ethernet, is &lt;a href="http://www.ieee802.org/3/ch/index.htmla/"target="new"&gt;working on&lt;/a&gt; much faster multi-Gig standard for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As automated driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) become more complex, Ethernet is seen as a key technology to rapidly process the information gathered by LIDAR, radar and other sensors that keep the vehicle on the road -- but consumers are wary of how safe those systems are.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Nearly a third of Americans surveyed in a November 2017 &lt;a href="https://blog.thalesesecurity.com/2017/11/28/new-report-discovering-consumer-attitudes-toward-connected-car-security/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Thales said data security features were the most important consideration when purchasing a connected vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the survey found the vast majority of U.S. residents (87 percent) believe the government should implement stricter data security regulations for connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should come as little surprise then that the global autonomous vehicle security market revenue is projected to reach nearly $7 billion in 2017 and is expected to reach $15.6 billion by 2023, according to &lt;a  href="https://industrytoday.co.uk/automotive/global-autonomous-vehicle-security-market-revenue-is-estimated-to-be--6-87-billion-in-2017-and-is-expected-to-reach--15-68-billion-by-2023/"target="new"&gt; recent research&lt;/a&gt; from Report Sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;While the evolving conversation about allowing self-driving cars onto our roads largely focuses on the technology of the vehicles themselves, far less of it takes into account the capacities and capabilities of our roadways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if two UC Berkeley graduate students get their way that may not be the case much longer. Specifically, designated lanes for autonomous cars are a major key in unlocking the full potential of self-driving car technology, and these lanes could spell the end of traffic jams and allow for highway travel at speeds far greater than current legal limits, according to the students' proposed project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Barrs and Baiyu Chen represented Team Berkeley at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers' 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.aem.org/news/april-2017/video-winners-of-infrastructure-vision-2050-challenge-look-beyond-status-quo/"target="new"&gt;Infrastructure Vision 2050 Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, taking home first place and $50,000 for a proposal they call the Hyperlane, a plan that would allow self-driving cars to travel at high speeds in designated lanes that would be constructed independently from -- but adjacent to -- existing roadways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with paid commuter lanes, owners of autonomous vehicles would pay to use a Hyperlane to access a road that would offer less congestion and the ability to travel at higher speeds. That fundamental similarity aside, though, the Hyperlane concept represents a complete departure from existing highway travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using advanced sensors installed on the physical road in conjunction with a central computer system, the Hyperlane would control participating automobiles with 5G technology to shepherd them to their destinations at speeds as fast as 120mph. Connected to every vehicle, the central computer would arrange a traffic pattern that would create optimum efficiency and, of course, safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We liken the Hyperlane network to an air traffic control system," Barrs told &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/03/self-driving-cars-high-speed-lane-berkeley-california"target="new"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrs and Chen estimated that, between the newly constructed roads, the on-road technology and the computer connectivity necessary to support a Hyperlane, such a project would carry a cost of over $11 million per mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such an enormous undertaking would likely need heavy subsidies to be viable for construction, the two students devised a pricing plan that they say would make the venture economically sustainable. A dynamic pricing plan not unlike Uber's surge pricing would make usage of the road more expensive at busier times of the day (and vice versa), ensuring that the road would never be over- or under-used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dynamic pricing ensures demand is distributed -- using price as the motivating incentive for users to use, or not use, the network," read a slide from Barrs and Chen's award-winning presentation, &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/08/self-driving-cars-hyperlane-2050/"target="new"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they first began researching transportation solutions, Barrs and Chen explored the possibilities of installing high-speed rail in the US. Once they determined that their biggest priority for their own proposal would be to connect disparate areas within major urban centers, though, they decided that a car-based proposal would be their best bet. Throughout their design process, however, they never stopped taking inspiration from bullet trains in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We started to deconstruct the high-speed rail experience and that's when we realized we could remove the tracks and deploy new, emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles," Barrs told Fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, Team Berkeley's proposal raises significant questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a time of intensifying economic stratification in the US, wouldn't infrastructure that benefits early adopters of autonomous vehicle technology -- i.e. the wealthy -- benefit a small, privileged class? Not if the Hyperlane works according to plan: A well-trodden lane for autonomous vehicles would ease traffic congestion for everyone on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, much of the viability of the Hyperlane plan relies on emerging, unproven technology. Regardless, the type of forward thinking incentivized by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers -- and exemplified by Barrs and Chen -- is essential as we look to integrate self-driving cars onto our roads in the most effective ways possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Ericsson's 5GCar project, which the Swedish telecommunications company has developed with several other partners, has now been accepted by the European Commission for Phase 2 of its 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership (5G PPP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award means that &lt;a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2017/6/ericsson-leads-european-5gcar-project" target="new"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; and its partners are eligible to receive funding from the European Union for the 5GCar project, which will seek to develop vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, the 5G PPP represents a coalition of public and private entities seeking to further 5G infrastructure throughout EU member countries. It is one of many sub-organizations that falls under the umbrella of the European Union's &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/what-horizon-2020" target="new"&gt;Horizon 2020&lt;/a&gt; research program. With nearly 80 billion euros ($91 billion) of total funding available between 2014 and 2020, Horizon 2020 supports research and development in science, technology and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;For its part, the 5G PPP has some ambitious goals. The group seeks to "[provide] 1000 times higher wireless area capacity and more varied service capabilities compared to 2010." It also plans to "[save] up to 90% of energy per service provided," and "[reduce] the average service creation time cycle from 90 hours to 90 minutes." &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Of the 101 proposals received by the European Commission for 5G PPP's Phase 2, Ericsson's 5GCar project was one of 21 that were retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By its very nature, the initiative will have a broad scope. V2X technology comprises many subcategories of autonomous vehicle technology, including vehicle-to-infrastructure, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian. A main objective of 5GCar is to "propose 5G radio-assisted positioning techniques for both vulnerable road users and vehicles to increase the availability of very accurate localization," according to the &lt;a href="https://5g-ppp.eu/5gcar/" target="new"&gt;proposal page&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a greater emphasis will be placed on understanding how self-driving cars relate to their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ericsson is the lead partner on the 5GCar project, but only one of 14 total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others include Volvo, King's College London and French telecommunications company Orange. Ericsson is a secondary partner on several of the other 21 Phase 2 projects, including &lt;a href="https://5g-ppp.eu/5g-Transformer/" target="new"&gt;5G-Transformer&lt;/a&gt; ("aims to transform today's mobile transport network into an SDN/NFV-based Mobile Transport and Computing Platform") and &lt;a href="https://5g-ppp.eu/matilda/" target="new"&gt;Matilda&lt;/a&gt; ("aims to devise and realize a radical shift in the development of software for 5G-ready applications, as well as virtual and physical network functions and network services, through the adoption of a unified programmability model").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the European Union has allocated 154 million euros ($175 million) for 5G PPP's Phase 2 projects.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This news is further evidence that the public and private sectors throughout Europe are quite serious about developing and implementing 5G technology in earnest, and they're willing to work together to do so. European companies such as Ericsson, Volvo and Orange will benefit in the short- and long-term, as they're helping shape the infrastructure on which their own products will someday be used.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Swift Navigation, a tech company that builds GPS technology designed for use specifically in autonomous vehicles, has raised $34 million in a Series B round of fundraising led by venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates. The influx of cash follows Swift's $11 million Series A round from 2015 and raises the company's total fundraising tally to over $47 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipse and First Round Capital also joined in the latest round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift Navigation specializes in Real Time Kinematics (RTK) GPS technology, which can accurately track global positioning all the way down to the centimeter. The company offers two products, both of which act as sensors and GPS receivers for various types of devices. The first, known as the Piksi, has applications in autonomous vehicle guidance, general and industrial robotics, aerial drones, precision agriculture and marine positioning. The second, the Duro, is "a &lt;a href="https://www.swiftnav.com/duro"target="new"&gt;ruggedized version&lt;/a&gt; of the Piksi." With a military-grade, weatherproof enclosure, the Duro thrives in tracking vehicles that operate in particularly tumultuous environments. The company's most recent round of fundraising comes on the tails of Swift's introduction of the Duro &lt;a href="http://mil-embedded.com/news/carnegie-robotics-swift-navigation-showcase-duro-a-gnss-receiver-at-xponential-2017/"target="new"&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RTK tech used by both the Piksi and the Duro is 100 times more accurate than the GPS used by most smartphones, according to Swift Navigation, even though it uses the same components as cell phones for its products. This repurposing of already available technology gives Swift Navigation a leg-up in the marketplace, according to CEO Timothy Harris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This allows us to offer pricing at ten times less than competitors," Harris told &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/28/swift-navigation-raises-34-million-for-autonomous-vehicle-gps/" target="new"&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt;. "For autonomous vehicles to become mainstream, the cost cannot be in the $10,000 range, but needs to be at a price point that can be built into a fleet of self-driving cars."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That $10,000 figure is at the top of a $7,000-to-$10,000 range in which most highly accurate GPS receivers are sold, according to Harris. The Piksi, meanwhile, retails for a mere $595. Swift Navigation has over 2,000 customers, a clientele that  ranges from companies designing self-driving cars to NASA missions monitoring ice and snow depth in various parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/helena-ball/2016-30-under-30-swift-navigation.html" target="new"&gt;Inc. honored&lt;/a&gt; Harris and fellow Swift Navigation co-founders Colin Beighley and Fergus Noble, naming them to Inc.'s 30 Under 30 list of young entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although continuing to cater to a wide range of uses, including drones and robotics systems, Swift is now focusing the greater part of its efforts on automated driving and facilitating the achievement of target zero (or vision zero -- the international plan for zero automotive-related deaths -- and contributing to the advancement of autonomous transportation," according to the profile.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift Navigation was founded in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For New Enterprise Associates, Swift Navigation represents one of several investments in companies that specialize in assisting self-navigating vehicles. Within the past couple of months, NEA has also led rounds of fundraising for &lt;a href="https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2017/06/28/nea-leads-50m-round-in-u-s-autonomous-driving-technology-start-up-drive-ai" target="new"&gt;Drive.ai&lt;/a&gt;, which develops deep learning intelligence software for autonomous vehicles, and &lt;a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/drones-autonomous-vehicles-on-echodynes-radar-as-it-pulls-in-29m-from-investors/" target="new"&gt;Echodyne&lt;/a&gt;, which specializes in designing radar array systems for drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Swift, the association with NEA serves as validation of the quality of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Swift Navigation is at the epicenter of some very exciting advancements in self-driving cars and autonomous robotics," &lt;a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/swift-navigation-raises-34-million-series-b-round-next-generation-high-accuracy-gps-2224243.htm" target="new"&gt;said Forest Baskett&lt;/a&gt;, one of the general partners at New Enterprise who led the Series B round for Swift. "NEA is thrilled to lead this round of financing, which will allow Swift to bring more innovative navigation products to market and sustain its rapid growth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift's ability to effectively raise money to help bolster sales, further fund research and development and expand the company's workforce speaks to both the importance of emerging low-cost precision GPS and the company's leading position in that space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Swift is, I think, leading the revolution at this point," Todd Humphreys, director of the University of Texas at Austin's Radionavigation Laboratory, told Inc. in last year's profile. "They are the best-funded early movers."&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Swedish transportation company Einride made major waves in the world of autonomous vehicles when it unveiled the T-Pod, a concept for a self-driving fleet truck that could be revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While most self-driving trucks are built more or less like standard ones so that a human driver can take over when desired or necessary, the T-Pod has no steering wheel -- in fact, it has no room for a driver at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean the truck will never be controlled by a human. While &lt;a href="https://www.einride.eu/#/pressrelease" target="new"&gt;the T-Pod&lt;/a&gt;, which will weigh 20 tons when transporting cargo at full capacity, will spend the majority of its journeys driving itself on highways, it will be remotely controlled by a human being when navigating urban destinations or other challenging environments. How exactly that remote control will take place is unclear. It's easy to imagine an arcade-style setup that simulates actually being in the vehicle, but Einride did not provide greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further differentiating the T-Pod from other AV transport trucks preparing to enter the marketplace is its electric powertrain. &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734192&amp;amp;" target="new"&gt;Nissan's semi-autonomous Leaf&lt;/a&gt; is an electric vehicle that will become available in North America later this year, but its status as a passenger vehicle is a far cry from the T-Pod prototype. Relative to the much smaller Leaf, the T-Pod's supposed electric capabilities are impressive. According to Einride, it will be able to drive 124 miles per charge. The new Leaf will go up to 200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T-Pod is not an early prototype. &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/05/einride-self-driving-truck-giant-freezer-wheels/" target="new"&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt; reports that the company wants to deliver the product to at least one customer by the end of this year. Its main sights are set on 2020, though, when Einride plans to have a fleet of 200 trucks working a fixed route between the Swedish cities of Helsingborg and Gothenburg, transporting two million pallets of cargo annually. Google Maps pegs the trip at 219km, or 136 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the T-Pod is unique in many ways, it will have plenty of competition when its ambitions expand beyond Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber is now considered as a leader in the autonomous truck space after buying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/18/12533736/uber-otto-trucks-acquisition-anthony-levandoswski" target="new"&gt;Otto&lt;/a&gt; for $680 million last year. And last month, pictures leaked of &lt;a href="http://jalopnik.com/heres-the-first-look-at-googles-self-driving-semi-truck-1796465587" target="new"&gt;the autonomous truck that Waymo is developing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler has also been testing self-driving trucks on open roads &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/04/daimler-self-driving-truck-test/" target="new"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanging over any discussion of self-driving trucks is the number of jobs that would be lost if they were to fully -- even partially -- replace their human-driven counterparts. There are 2.5 million trucking jobs in the US alone. As seen in the photographs of Waymo's driverless truck, most current prototypes allow room for a driver who would navigate the vehicles during more difficult portions of a drive. Success for Einride's T-Pod would surely elicit further resistance from those invested in keeping trucking jobs alive.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;How many times have you purchased a new phone, only to find out the next hot device is right around the corner with even more bells and whistles? The same is becoming true when buying a new vehicle. With the pace of change in connected vehicle technology, the new car you drive off the lot today with the latest and greatest technology and driving features is well on the way to being obsolete tomorrow. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in the age of the Internet of Things (IoT), where vehicles connect to devices, other vehicles, infrastructure and myriad services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many automakers are unable to innovate fast enough to keep up with the pace of change, struggling to ensure the connected cars of today can connect with the new devices, networks and services of tomorrow, while remaining safe and secure. The challenge is compounded by the fact that both the IoT and the number of connected cars are growing exponentially. By 2020, the number of connected "things" is expected to reach &lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3598917" target="new"&gt;20.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;, while the number of connected vehicles on the road is predicted to hit &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-connected-smart-cars-2016-10" target="new"&gt;381 million&lt;/a&gt;. Here are four ways to future-proof the connected car:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Standardize for security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of new devices and connections also means the rise of new cyber threats for the connected car's massive attack surface. While we cannot anticipate all possible security risks five or ten years down the road, we can better prepare to combat them by standardizing in-vehicle networks. Instead of relying on the numerous siloed, heritage networks, each with different protocols and security strategies, automakers can future-proof the connected car with an Internet Protocol (IP) over Ethernet backbone architecture for in-vehicle networking. This enables the standardization of all communications that pass through the backbone, which analyzes and controls traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With IP over Ethernet, the cars of today can seamlessly make way for new connections, while ensuring data security (and thus, driver safety). The technology not only allows automakers to utilize proven enterprise security technologies (including access controls, intrusion prevention and detection, firewalls, credentialing and more), but also makes the vehicle's architecture more agile. Automakers can essentially plug and play new sensors, devices and actuators as they come along, without the need to worry about incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Optimize bandwidth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest roadblocks to the evolution of the connected vehicle is bandwidth. Highly automated connected cars of the near future will generate prolific amounts of data (up to &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3147892/internet/one-autonomous-car-will-use-4000-gb-of-dataday.html" target="new"&gt;four terabytes&lt;/a&gt; per hour). Although existing network technologies, like Controller Area Network (CAN) and Local Interconnect Network (LIN), may be adequate for basic telematics and control, they are not sufficient for next-generation connected car features and capabilities that are beginning to materialize. For instance, highly automated vehicles will need to be able to pipe high-definition video from multiple cameras to a central brain to avoid collisions and keep drivers safe. Fortunately, the latest Ethernet standards for automotive can increase bandwidth by a factor of 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, future-proofing the connected car not only requires increasing bandwidth, but also using it more efficiently. Fog computing, which brings the cloud to the edge with distributed computers and storage, can dramatically help optimize bandwidth. Using configurable rules, fog computing technologies can determine what data to send immediately, versus what data to store or forward (perhaps when it is more cost effective). Edge analytics helps filter and compress the data so that only the most essential and actionable information is sent to a central brain in the car, or to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple examples of where fog computing would apply. When on cruise control, a vehicle's speed rarely changes. So, sending speed data to the cloud only when there's a change, instead of every fraction of a second, can save a great deal of bandwidth. Or when a car is at a stoplight on a desolate road, a single video frame may be all that is needed to understand the surroundings for automated driving or navigation. This uses vastly less bandwidth than a stream of high-definition video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Virtualize for agility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant amount of computing power is required to provide the intelligence needed in the connected car, especially in highly automated vehicles. In fact, today's connected cars have the computing power of &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf" target="new"&gt;20 modern PCs&lt;/a&gt; and feature about 100 million lines of code. Undoubtedly, as cars become more complex and more automated, more computing power will be necessary. Automakers can future-proof the connected car by consolidating computing power into a virtualized, centralized compute and service device that is expandable over time. This eliminates the complexity of relying on more than 100 individual computers onboard, as the various electronic control units (ECUs) are streamlined and consolidated by virtualizing some of their common logic. For example, automakers can centralize computer vision object recognition so that different ECUs controlling assisted parking, assisted steering and lane keeping (and eventually highly automated driving) are simplified. Each ECU does not need its own computer vision stack and computing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through virtualization, automakers can also prolong the vehicle's life by making it easily upgradeable with more compute and storage to run the latest applications and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This allows for a more service-oriented architecture (SOA), which provides the flexibility needed to introduce new applications and services, thereby reducing future manufacturing and maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Simplify management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tens of millions of vehicles connecting to numerous services globally, it will be impossible for automakers to manage the connectivity and performance of each one without automation and a unified view. To future-proof the connected car, automakers should adopt a centralized, automated approach to managing large numbers of vehicles and the services to which they connect. This can be achieved by IoT connectivity management platforms, which manage how and when a vehicle connects, and what it can do with its connections throughout its lifecycle. Such platforms can also provide monitoring and diagnostics, continuous learning and even self-healing. Moreover, they provide automakers and other members of the ecosystem with a unified view of information, as though they were looking at a single pane of glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With information on vehicle performance, service usage, security and more at its fingertips, an automaker can easily make informed decisions that ultimately provide better safety and convenience. For example, if an automaker detects a pattern of repairs that suggests a vehicle's drive train might have a design weakness, it can change the health monitoring telematics configuration of all the vehicles that have that drive train -- all with a single click from a cloud-based controller. Or, when a new security threat is detected, an automaker can see at a glance which vehicles are affected, and which need a software update or reconfiguration. It can then push out the updates immediately to mitigate risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of the cars of today may not be completely ready for the connections of tomorrow, automakers can jump on the fast track to innovation by leveraging proven enterprise technologies -- like standardization to IP over Ethernet, virtualization, fog computing and automation -- to future-proof their vehicles. Consumers will have the peace of mind that their vehicles are safe, secure and agile enough to evolve at the pace of the IoT, without any bumps in the road.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Everywhere you look, there are signs that our trip to a future of autonomous vehicles is constantly accelerating.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Every week brings a new set of announcements of partnerships between automakers and software companies to advance their capabilities. Each year brings a new set of automobiles dripping with features that look like early stages in self-driving technology. Legislators are beginning to plan for roads filled with autonomous cars, and consumers grow more comfortable with the technology as they hear more about it. (See {doclink 734359}.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For German auto supplier Bosch, the company doesn't have to look far to see the promise of a growing enthusiasm for self-driving cars among enterprise and customers alike. Its sales figures tell the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of July, the company announced that it has seen a strong surge in sales at its automotive division, known as Mobility Solutions, which makes radar systems and video sensors, as well as various other advanced safety systems for self-driving cars. Last year was a wildly successful one for Mobility Solutions, which grew 5.5% to achieve $49.8 billion in sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That growth is only going to get faster. Bosch said that it expected Mobility Solutions would grow an additional 7% in 2017, pushing it to $53.3 billion in sales. While the scope of Mobility Solutions represents all automotive components at Bosch, it's clear that emerging autonomous vehicle technology is what's driving this recent growth. The company said that it anticipated a 60% boost in sales of radars systems and an 80% growth in video sensors this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobility Solutions itself is an enormous company under the umbrella of the Bosch conglomerate, employing 227,000 people, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bosch-autos-mobility-idUSKBN19P138" target="new"&gt;including 3,000 developers&lt;/a&gt; who are designing the various components of automated driving systems.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This includes crash avoidance systems that employ both the aforementioned radar and sensor technology, as well as various other software and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has brought a steady stream of announced partnerships and collaborations for Bosch, which is working with nearly every leader in the AV market. &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2017/03/16/bosch/" target="new"&gt;In March&lt;/a&gt;, software giant Nvidia revealed that it was working with the company on an AI car computer for the mass market. &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-daimler-bosch-selfdriving-idUSKBN1760SJ" target="new"&gt;In April&lt;/a&gt;, Bosch and Mercedes owner Daimler announced plans to develop self-driving "robo-taxis." &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/baidu-teams-up-with-bosch-and-continental-on-self-driving-tech/" target="new"&gt;In June&lt;/a&gt;, Bosch and fellow auto industry supplier Continental teamed up with Chinese Internet provider Baidu to work on autonomous vehicles and non-autonomous connected cars, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the company is doing well with its self-driving car projects, and it's not afraid to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are growing faster than the market," Rolf Bulander, chairman of Mobility Solutions at Bosch, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that statement is true, it perhaps undersells just how representative Bosch's figures are of the industry at large. While the company is certainly a forward-thinking leader in self-driving car technology, it's hardly an upstart. Bosch is &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/assets/PDF/CA105764617.PDF" target="news"&gt;the world's leading auto supplier&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while there's not a one-to-one correlation between Bosch's growth and the growth of the self-driving car sector, it's not far off. If Bosch is doing well, you can bet that everyone else is, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that gaming on cell phone apps has become an incredibly popular pastime. Mobile games generated a stunning $40.6 billion in 2016, a statistic that confirms a trend that is plainly evident in waiting rooms, public transit vehicles and restaurants across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As prevalent as gaming is, however, it is still considered a guilty pleasure by many and not exactly seen as productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are exceptions to the rule. Take &lt;a href="https://mty.ai/" target="new"&gt;Mighty AI&lt;/a&gt;, for example. The company's mobile app lets users make money -- a woman profiled in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mighty-ai-training-self-driving-cars/" target="new"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; story on Mighty AI made $300 last year -- by generating data that is invaluable for the artificial intelligence that powers self-driving car technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To safely and effectively navigate roads, autonomous vehicles need to be able to distinguish various factors of their environments from one another. Road signs need to be differentiated from the horizon, and different types of road signs need to be differentiated from one another. Yellow lights are different than the sunset, bicycles are different than motorcycles and pedestrians are different than Rollerbladers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemingly small details can greatly inform a car's decision making process. Sensor technology in autonomous vehicle prototypes has long been able to identify minuscule differences between separate physical entities. The issue lies in the machine having the intelligence to know exactly what those entities are, and how to react accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Mighty AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's app works like this: Users are given an image of an on-road scene from the POV of a self-driving car's onboard cameras. Painstakingly, users move pixel-by-pixel throughout the photograph, labeling everything from pedestrians to cars to scenery to signage. They use a different color to draw boxes around each, and the end result looks like something out of a coloring book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By cross-referencing millions of annotated images with one another, computers are slowly able to identify even obscure images from disadvantaged perspectives. The key word here is "millions." While machine learning technology lets software build upon its own knowledge, it requires an incredibly large data set first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the important role of the user information gathered by the app, Mighty AI has several safeguards in place to make sure it's getting reliable annotations from its users. To become eligible for paid "tasks," users must successfully complete a series of tutorials where they label parts of an image. Even for those users who are approved, there are further elements of accountability: Machine learning can establish which users are most precise and accurate in their labeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mighty AI's applications are actually broader than the already enormous task of teaching autonomous vehicles: The company utilizes user data to educate artificial intelligence of all sorts. Founded as Spare5, it relaunched under its new name in January of this year, with a $14 million round of fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seemingly every industry clamors for usable artificial intelligence technology, Mighty AI stands to have quite an effect across a variety of sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When new technologies are in their infancies, there are usually a large number of companies looking to get in on the action. As industries mature, however, the businesses that are most successful in the space expand their market share and the overall number of players shrinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Iagnemma, co-founder and CEO of AV software company nuTonomy, believes that the contraction in the autonomous vehicle space may be less than in other tech markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iagnemma explained his position in &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/07/11/driverless-tech-pioneer-predicts-multiple-winners-in-autonomous-car-race/#5c4e8bf671a4" target="new"&gt;a recent interview with Forbes&lt;/a&gt;. He spoke about the challenges of developing globally effective autonomous vehicle software and how those challenges can impact companies competing in the self-driving car space. His idea, essentially, is that the legal, geographic and cultural differences between various regions make it unlikely that any single company will be first to market in more than a handful of those regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the dirty little secrets I would say, is that the software today is pretty city- or country-specific," Iagnemma told Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think we sometimes think that once one company gets the technology right then overnight we'll have autonomous cars on the road in every major city worldwide," he continued. "But in fact that's not the case. It's going to be a city-by-city, country-by-country rollout of this technology, which is going to take some time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO of the Boston-based company listed a few reasons why translating self-driving car software from one locale to the next would require adjustments, including differences in traffic laws and the varying physical appearance of road markings and signage. A dilemma that would require more nuanced problem-solving, however, is cultural differences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In Singapore drivers generally obey the rules, but the attitude around pedestrians is actually quite different," he said. "It's culturally different. People drive safely, but it's not the same deference shown to pedestrians."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeals court in Singapore ruled last year that a pedestrian legally crossing the street was "&lt;a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/pedestrians-with-right-of-way-must-still-share-responsibility" target="new"&gt;15% responsible&lt;/a&gt;" for being hit by a car. While that is an extreme example, it illustrates how unwritten cultural norms can impact traffic patterns. The minimal space between automobiles in Beijing or New York City traffic would be seen as acts of aggression in more low-key cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that there are so many regional-specific elements at play, what that means is I think we're going to see the emergence of multiple winners per region," said Iagnemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the director of MIT's Robotic Mobility Group, Iagnemma joined co-founder Emilio Frazzoli in launching nuTonomy in 2013. The company has partnerships with Lyft, Peugeot and graphics chip maker Nvidia. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/3/15515410/groupe-psa-peugeot-nutonomy-partnership-self-driving-singapore" target="new"&gt;It launched a self-driving taxi program in Singapore&lt;/a&gt; with Peugeot earlier this year. Between his leadership role at an innovative AV company and his reputation as a thought leader in robotics, Iagnemma is worth listening to. If he foresees something to be a challenge for self-driving technology, then it almost certainly will be so.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Testing self-driving cars is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is the initial investment required to develop a baseline technology. Then, there's the challenge of putting that technology into a physical car, whether it be a pre-existing model or a brand new prototype.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only certain areas of the country allow AV testing on their roads, and they require extensive permits and permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these roadblocks are time-consuming, but they are also necessary to ensure that autonomous vehicles are not deployed prematurely, and that all of the proper precautionary measures are in place. Imagine if an issue like Samsung's exploding phones happened with self-driving cars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to an illuminating &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/inside-waymos-secret-testing-and-simulation-facilities/537648/" target="new"&gt;feature in The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, we now know that &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; has figured out a new way to test its vehicles to make sure they're safe: by operating them in a virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Until now, the project had been kept entirely under wraps -- as author Alexis C. Madrigal describes. The software used is called Carcraft -- a play on the massive multiplayer online game World of Warcraft. The "secret base," complete with real-world road architecture, is located in the Central Valley of California and is named Castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Waymo has never unveiled this system before," writes Madrigal. "The miles they drive on regular roads show them areas where they need extra practice. They carve the spaces they need into the earth at Castle, which lets them run thousands of different scenarios in situ. And in both kinds of real-world testing, their cars capture enough data to create full digital recreations at any point in the future. In that virtual space, they can unhitch from the limits of real life and create thousands of variations of any single scenario, and then run a digital car through all of them. As the driving software improves, it's downloaded back into the physical cars, which can drive more and harder miles, and the loop begins again."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key word there is "thousands."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To track a single scenario thousands of times on a physical road would take an unfeasible amount of time, and adding variables to those situations would multiply that already unreasonable amount of time by an order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using computer simulations, engineers can test self-driving cars over and over, providing an invaluable element of repetition--and the clarity that comes with it -- to their operations. It also helps save money on physical prototypes, meaning Waymo can reinvest that money back into software development until they're ready to produce hardware at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most critical is that neither the tests in the physical world nor the ones that take place virtually exist in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, both inform one another in every sense of the word, and create a feedback loop of learning that is accelerating Waymo's technological development at an incredible rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If other AV developers are doing the same thing, they may be eager to pull back the curtain soon for fear of giving investors the impression that they've fallen behind. If other AV developers aren't doing the same thing, they should probably start today.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In considering the connected car and its telematics services, the conversation tends to focus on either consumer or commercial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telematics involves the transmission of data from a vehicle across distances, which include GPS navigation, security features -- such as vehicle tracking and remote locking -- and vehicle diagnostic information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the regular driver those services are convenient. For fleet managers they are essential, helping them track vehicles and monitor their condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one fleet manager, however, where telematics becomes even more critical: The Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DHS recently awarded a five-year blanket purchase agreement for vehicle telematics services to &lt;a href="https://www.wexinc.com/" target="new"&gt;Wex, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a payments solutions company based in Maine that counts fleet management technologies among its specialties. With a fleet of about 52,000 vehicles, the applications of Wex's technology towards the DHS's fleet will be wide-ranging and of great importance: preventing terrorism, enforcing border security and providing disaster prevention and relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Department of Homeland Security operates one of the largest fleets in the US today, and it's an honor to be selected to work with this team," Bernie Kavanagh, senior vice president and general manager of North America large fleet and strategic relationships at Wex, &lt;a href="http://www.government-fleet.com/channel/gps-telematics/news/story/2017/08/department-of-homeland-security-signs-telematics-agreement.aspx" target="new"&gt;wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We're looking forward to arming DHS with WEX technology to provide their fleet managers access to data-driven insights to help them manage the daily operations of their fleet."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wex has developed &lt;a href="http://www.wextelematics.com/fleets-industry" target="new"&gt;fleet tracking solutions&lt;/a&gt; for several industries, including residential service vehicles, construction vehicles, heavy construction vehicles, delivery vehicles and long-haul trucks. With &lt;a href="http://www.wextelematics.com/sites/default/files/wex_telematics_for_dispatchdelivery.pdf" target="new"&gt;delivery vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, Wex promotes benefits like integration of Garmin GPS services that give assignments to drivers in real time and live alerts that notify managers when, say, a door to a vehicle is opened in an unexpected circumstance.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By optimizing these offerings, Wex is able to provide a 12.8% reduction of labor costs and overtime hours, a 10-20% decrease in fuel costs, and a 38% reduction in accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not revealed how exactly Wex will tailor its services to the varied fleet managed by the Department of Homeland Security, which face unique -- and especially critical -- challenges when it comes to operations and security. The nature of DHS's work means that such disclosures could compromise its efforts to combat hackers and terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a Homeland Security fleet still requires many of the same things that a normal one does. So it's likely that Wex's suite will look similar to those it offers to fleets of long-haul trucks and construction equipment. While fleets vary in shape, size and function, they can all benefit from the assurances and innovations brought about by enhanced vehicle telematics technology.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;On August 22, Apple fans everywhere released deep sighs of disappointment when The New York Times reported that the company had abandoned its ambitions to build a self-driving car -- although the company is reportedly continuing to develop autonomous systems that may be applicable to AVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the news all the more hard to swallow were all the juicy tidbits, such as using augmented reality to superimpose graphics onto the road through the car's windshield, as well as what "Titan" -- Apple's codename for its AV project -- &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Apple had brought on many talented engineers and designers to work on driverless cars, and the Times piece begged the question: What would these people do next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of them, the answer is becoming clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-30/group-of-17-apple-auto-engineers-is-said-to-join-startup-zoox" target="new"&gt;A Bloomberg report&lt;/a&gt; finds that 17 automotive engineers who once worked for Apple have moved on to work at self-driving car startup &lt;a href="http://zoox.com/" target="new"&gt;Zoox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engineers specialize in physical components of cars like suspension systems and braking that occur in both AVs and human-driven cars. With Apple having abandoned its goals of building an iCar, these employees likely had little reason to stick around in Cupertino, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Zoox is nominally a startup, it's far from a small-time operation. It raised $200 million in a 2016 round of fundraising, and was valued at over $1.5 billion dollars that same year. It is perhaps most notable, however, for the secrecy it imposes on its own operations. The only people who truly know what Zoox is working on are Zoox executives and employees. At IEEE Spectrum, journalist Mark Harris has dedicated a substantial amount of time getting the scoop on the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I first investigated this stealthy startup for IEEE Spectrum in 2015, revealing its ambition to develop a fully automated robotaxi from the ground up," &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/secretive-robotaxi-startup-zoox-prepares-for-realworld-testing" target="new"&gt;Harris wrote&lt;/a&gt; this March. "Two years later, Zoox is valued at US $1.55 billion, employs over 200 people, and has more than 50 PhDs and postdocs in computer vision, artificial intelligence, and automotive design -- many previously employed at Tesla. It remains one of the lowest profile companies in the Valley, shunning press coverage and sharing nothing more than a stylized infinity logo on its website."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, Harris' reporting remains our best account of the goings on at Zoox. The company is aiming to develop a vehicle with Level 5 autonomy, according to his report. Its first prototype is an all-electric car, and patents filed by the company reveal a design in which all four passenger seats face inwards, presumably eliminating any possibility of a human driving in Zoox's vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the level of enthusiasm that surrounds anything and everything Apple, this series of hires may be the most attention that Zoox has received by the media. Considering how secretive the company has shown itself to be, they're probably not all that happy about the press. Sooner or later, though, Zoox was going to have to engage in some level of publicity around its operations. The hires just made that day come a little sooner.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Car keys are an incredibly easy item to lose, and the consequences are beyond annoying: You're in a parking lot somewhere, and feel your heart sink when you realize your keys aren't in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you have to find a way to get home. Then, if you still can't find them and have to replace the computerized keys that are common for most modern vehicles, it'll set you back hundreds of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes keys so easy to lose is their small size, but if Jaguar Land Rover's latest concept design ever comes to fruition, that won't be a problem any longer.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The device that will access cars isn't a key at all -- it's a steering wheel. Known as Sayer, the steering wheel is designed to assist with all aspects of a person's life, using voice-activated artificial intelligence technology. It would live and function in your home, and it would attach to (and detach from) any self-driving car you may enter in the autonomous, ride-sharing future. Think of it like an Amazon Echo that you ping pongs between your home and vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Need to be at a meeting two hours away from home by 8 a.m. tomorrow?," asks &lt;a href="http://media.jaguar.com/news/2017/09/hello-my-name-sayer-i-am-steering-wheel-future" target="new"&gt;Jaguar's press release&lt;/a&gt;. "Simply ask Sayer from the comfort of your living room and it will work out when you get up, when a car needs to autonomously arrive at your door and even advise which parts of the journey you might enjoy driving yourself."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design was unveiled at the Jaguar Land Rover Tech Fest at Central St Martins, University of the Arts London, early in September. Under the theme "Tech with Heart," the inaugural event presented attendees with a forward-facing vision of futuristic automobile design. Jaguar engineers were on site, interacting with guests and participating in panels and demonstrations on the automobile of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

{videoembed | 736132}

&lt;p&gt;"Attendees can fast forward to the future and glimpse a world where cars drive themselves and vehicles are shared, not owned," read a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The removable steering wheel concept is exceedingly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It imagines that, in the future, our lives will be centered around the automobile, with a steering wheel serving as our personal assistant. It would act as a sort of concierge, immediately converting the preferences of a shared car to our own specific tastes. One can imagine sliding into the passenger seat of a car-share vehicle, inserting an AI-equipped steering wheel and having the configuration of the seat and temperature  adapt to preferred settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all concepts, Sayer is unlikely to come to fruition anytime soon. But the thinking behind it is significant. With so much attention paid to complete autonomous vehicles, Sayer represents a more device-centric approach that can work across platforms, and could represent a new direction for Jaguar Land Rover in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It's easy to see why so many companies with autonomous vehicle aspirations start off by getting involved with trucking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, self-driving freight trucks should be on roads in large numbers before consumer automobiles are. While the initial price of consumer AVs will likely be too expensive for people to trade in their conventional human-driven cars at first, trucking companies will have the capital necessary to make large initial investments and will also benefit immediately from the savings brought about by AV operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, for all the legitimate concern by drivers and unions over how autonomous trucks will affect jobs in the sector, the fact of the matter is that there is a shortage of truck drivers in the United States. Self-driving trucks will help alleviate that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When software company and AV tech leader &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/drive-automotive-technology.html" target="new"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; announced in August that it was a lead investor in &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2017/08/16/autonomous-truck-startup-tusimple/" target="new"&gt;a $20 million fund-raising round&lt;/a&gt; for Chinese self-driving truck startup &lt;a href="http://www.tusimple.com/index-en.html" target="new"&gt;TuSimple&lt;/a&gt;, it was seen as a logical and savvy move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It often seems that there is a greater diversity of technological approaches in AV trucking development than in consumer AV development, and TuSimple serves as yet another example of a company putting forth tech that we haven't seen elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using the conventional (and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;oft-maligned&lt;/a&gt;) system of lasers known as Lidar that we so often see on self-driving cars, TuSimple's platform relies on eight cameras and three millimeter-wave radar units for its core hardware. The company says this gives it a significant leg up on the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With trucks, the sensors must be even more powerful due to the longer stopping times required," according to &lt;a href="http://www.tusimple.com/core-en.html" target="new"&gt;TuSimple's website&lt;/a&gt;. "Our platform's camera and millimeter-wave radar array allows for sensing distances of up to 200 meters from the vehicle, compared to the standard 80 meters using LiDAR arrays. This allows our system to safely observe its surroundings when driving heavy freight trucks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interconnected world of AV development, there may be no single company that is multi-tethered to a greater degree than Nvidia. It is working on AI and deep learning cloud tech &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/gpu-accelerated-microsoft-azure.html" target="new"&gt;with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and its automotive partners form &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/automotive-partner-innovation.html" target="new"&gt;a long list&lt;/a&gt; that includes Toyota, Tesla, BMW and Baidu. While the nature of TuSimple's relationship with Nvidia is unclear beyond this initial investment, the startup figures to benefit greatly from this new association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nvidia is unrivaled in delivering the computing performance needed for autonomous vehicles," said Xiaodi Hou, CTO of TuSimple. "By combining Nvidia technology with our expertise in computer vision and artificial intelligence, we're building a world-class platform that will disrupt the freight industry. We highly value our strategic partnership with Nvidia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days after the investment was announced, news came out that TuSimple will test its trucks &lt;a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/082117_tusimple/chinas-tusimple-taps-tucson-as-test-site-self-driving-trucks/" target="new"&gt;in Tucson, Ariz&lt;/a&gt;. That will put the Chinese company head-to-head against American competitors Waymo and Uber in the AV trucking space. It will be interesting to see how TuSimple's prototypes stack up.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The connected car was once just a dream for consumers and automakers around the world. A concept we hoped would become a reality. Now, there are just shy of &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2970017"target="new"&gt;quarter billion connected cars&lt;/a&gt; on the roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex car innovations spark from simple ideas. Early-stage concepts become widely adopted technologies. These technologies go on to make driving more efficient, our roads safer, and our rides more connected.&lt;/P&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;But we don't get there without a little elbow grease, a lot of collaboration and the testing facilities to support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;AT&amp;T Drive Studio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Automakers and telecom companies are investing time, talent and tenacity to further the connected car industry. And we're carving out dedicated spaces to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is the AT&amp;T Drive Studio, the first connected car innovation center in the US opened by a wireless carrier. It's a place where the world's most innovative companies and developers converge to create the future of connected cars. And the future is in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTdxUdeVD6I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drive Studio is a fully staffed, dynamic environment. Auto companies from all over the globe come together to enhance the driving experience by improving vehicle safety, entertainment and security.  We're also working on voice services, remote vehicle access, smart home integration and more.&lt;/P

&lt;p&gt;Check out this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTdxUdeVD6I&amp;feature=youtu.be"target="new"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;American Center for Mobility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Beyond the AT&amp;T Drive Studio, we've teamed up with the American Center for Mobility to speed the development of self-driving vehicles. Working with the center and its collaborative approach of engaging the automotive ecosystem will give us the space to explore, create, collaborate and safely test driverless technologies for consumer cars and trucks as well as commercial vehicles and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening its doors this December, we'll serve as the Center's exclusive cellular network provider through 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large focus for AT&amp;T at the Drive Studio and the American Center for Mobility is understanding how we can deliver value via to V2X, domestically and internationally. V2X is designed to help vehicles "talk" with each other, the infrastructure around them, cellular networks and even pedestrians. This technology will help improve safety and vehicle security. It may also be used to help reduce traffic congestion, drive route efficiency and protect the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technology continues to be refined and will likely be coming to both human-driven vehicles and highly automated vehicles in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The road ahead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
These investments in innovation will allow AT&amp;T to continue to maintain our leadership position and evolve our products and WiFi capabilities to meet industry needs. This also helps ensure that we can keep our consumers connected virtually anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're innovating and collaborating to turn today's connected car dreams into reality. And as we look to 2018, expanded entertainment options, seamless functionality and more is right at our fingertips.&lt;/P&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The question of how insurance companies will build policies around the first generation of autonomous vehicles has prompted plenty of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long term, self-driving cars figure to be much safer than when human drivers are behind the wheel. This means that insurance policies will likely be less expensive than they are today, which, in turn, could hurt the business outlook for insurance companies, most of which are publicly traded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, however, the situation is far less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans as a whole still have mixed opinions on the viability of AVs, and it has seemed possible that initial insurance plans for driverless cars could actually be more expensive than those for human-driven cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, AV developers strongly believe that the cars they are working on &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; perform better than human drivers in specific situations. And insurance companies are all about numbers: If the data proves that self-driving cars are safer, premiums for autonomous vehicles will be lower than traditional automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla has already taken a step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a new partnership with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and Aviva, &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; plans to offer a service called InsureMyTesla, a customized insurance package for Tesla owners that accounts for the inclusion of Autopilot in the vehicles. The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2017/10/13/tesla-insuremytesla-insurance-program-us-canada/" target="new"&gt;Electrek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/insuremytesla" target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla touts some of the features of InsureMyTesla: A "New Car Replacement" service that "allows for a brand new car within the first year in case of a total loss." It also offers "[rates] guaranteed for one year," "genuine replacement parts" and "optional 24-hour roadside assistance beyond the Tesla warranty."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late last summer, Electrek first &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2016/08/30/tesla-enters-car-insurance-business-self-driving-cars-prepare-disrupt-industry/" target="new"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on InsureMyTesla, which was then first being introduced in Australia and Hong Kong. Since then, the program had grown to over 20 countries. The partnership with Liberty Mutual enabled Tesla to bring the service to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Automotive News &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20170604/FINANCE_AND_INSURANCE/170609884/" target="new"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that AAA would be raising rates as much as 30% for Tesla vehicles, based on data from the Highway Loss Data Institute that the insurance company claimed showed exceptionally high frequency and costs of claims for Tesla vehicles. Tesla strongly disputed that interpretation of the data at the time, and hinted that they would soon offer their own insurance for US customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Not to the exclusion of insurance providers but if we find that insurance providers are not matching the insurance proportionate to the risk of the car, then if we need to, we will in-source it," Tesla CEO Elon Musk told &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2017/10/13/tesla-insuremytesla-insurance-program-us-canada/"target="new"&gt;Electrek&lt;/a&gt;. "I think we will find that insurance providers do adjust the insurance cost proportionate to the risk of a Tesla."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, Tesla believes that its Autopilot-equipped cars are at least as safe as conventional automobiles. (It's also worth noting that electric cars are widely considered to require less services than non-electric vehicles, a fact that ought to drive down insurance rates for Tesla cars.) Insurers can certainly claim differently, and perhaps AAA won't be the only one to raise rates on Teslas. But by offering InsureMyTesla, Tesla is ensuring that customers won't be scared off by potentially high insurance costs.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A high percentage of American autonomous vehicle operations are concentrated in a small number of locales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States such as California and Michigan that offer incentives -- be they permissive on-road AV testing laws or tax benefits -- tend to attract the majority of self-driving car companies to their cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based in Massachusetts, driverless startup &lt;a href="http://www.nutonomy.com/" target="new"&gt;NuTonomy&lt;/a&gt; is a bit of an outlier. The company was founded by Karl Iagnemma and Emilio Frazzoli who decided to launch their venture after researching driverless technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Mechanical Engineering. From their headquarters in Boston, the two launched NuTonomy as an autonomous vehicle consultancy in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 2015, NuTonomy pivoted to developing self-driving cars itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, after quickly making significant waves in the driverless car sector, NuTonomy is ready for its next chapter, having been recently acquired by &lt;a href="https://www.delphi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Delphi Automotive&lt;/a&gt; for $450 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our mission has always been to radically improve the safety, efficiency, and accessibility of transportation worldwide," &lt;a href="http://www.nutonomy.com/press-release/delphi-reaches-agreement-to-acquire-nutonomy/"target="new"&gt;Iagnemma&lt;/a&gt;, who is NuTonomy's CEO, noted in a statement. "Joining forces with Delphi brings us one step closer to achieving our goal with a market-leading partner whose vision directly aligns with ours. Together we will set the global standard for excellence in autonomous driving technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NuTonomy's vision has, in fact, always been global. In their MIT days, Iagnemma and Frazzoli helped establish the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology. NuTonomy was actually spun out of this project, and the company has always worked closely with Singapore to test vehicles there. The company will remain headquartered in Boston after the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"When we formed the company, we realized that it was worth the cost to go halfway around the world to be able to reap these benefits of being in a place that's just, we believe, the best place in the world to develop driverless car technology today," Iagnemma &lt;a href="http://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2017/10/25/delphi-purchase-nutonomy" target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Boston public radio station WBUR recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the acquisition, Delphi effectively doubles the number of employees it has working on self-driving cars, which will now be around 200. Earlier this fall, Delphi announced that it would be spinning off its autonomous division into &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736848" target="new"&gt;a company all its own&lt;/a&gt; known as Aptiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are delighted to welcome Karl, Emilio, and their talented team to Delphi. The combination of the NuTonomy and Ottomatika teams, along with Delphi's industry-leading portfolio of perception systems and smart vehicle architecture solutions, further enhances our competitive position as the industry's most formidable provider of autonomous mobility solutions," said Delphi CEO Kevin Clark, referencing another company that Delphi acquired &lt;a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/august/spinoff-acquired.html" target="new"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. "This transaction is another example of our ongoing dedication to developing, implementing, and commercializing the highest performing and safest [automated driving] system available."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever driven a car through what meteorologists love to call "wintry mix" can attest to the challenges that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falling snow negatively impacts visibility and icy or snow-covered streets can wreak havoc on a vehicle's traction. One ill-advised turn of the steering wheel could result in a car careening off the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of white knuckles, self-driving cars face very similar struggles as humans in these conditions. Their sensors are vulnerable to being impaired just like human eyes, and the process of teaching autonomous vehicle computers to adjust their driving technique for icy roads is complicated by the large number of unpredictable variables that a vehicle encounters from second to second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of testing of self-driving cars takes place in regions of the western US where snow isn't a common occurrence, it can be tough for developers to build vehicles that are able to perform in winter conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why Waymo is building its operations in a part of the country where the weather is considerably less hospitable during the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Medium post titled "Michigan is Waymo's winter wonderland," Waymo CEO John Krafcik outlined how the Alphabet company is taking its self-driving cars to the Wolverine State for testing in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Now, just in time for the first snowfall of the season, Waymo self-driving cars will hit Michigan roads for the winter," Krafcik &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/michigan-is-waymos-winter-wonderland-9b3cffbb9bab" target="new"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. "Building on the snowy work we've done to date, we'll be giving our vehicles even more practice driving in snow, sleet and ice. This type of testing will give us the opportunity to assess the way our sensors perform in wet, cold conditions. And it will also build on the advanced driving skills we've developed over the last eight years by teaching our cars how to handle things like skidding on icy, unplowed roads."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Krafcik references, this isn't the company's first time testing its cars in wintry conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Making snow angels in Tahoe!," the company wrote in a tweet this past March, which included a photograph of a Waymo van in a snowy parking lot. "We're testing our self-driving Pacificas in cold weather and collecting snow data to train our software." The company's testing in Michigan will build upon the learning gained in Lake Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo is not new to Michigan, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2016, the company opened a 53,000 sq ft development center in Novi to "more easily collaborate with our Michigan partners," Krafcik wrote. Waymo has a large fleet of Pacifica minivans that are produced by Chrysler, which is headquartered in nearby Auburn Hills. But as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552598/waymo-michigan-self-driving-car-test" target="new"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt; points out, the Waymo move is still likely to cause waves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The arrival of Waymo's autonomous vehicles may, however, send a shiver up the spine of Detroit's Big Three: Ford, GM, and Fiat-Chrysler. Last January, the company took the stage at the North American International Auto Show to unveil for the first time its self-driving minivans. So it was probably only a matter of time before the company began testing in Detroit too."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, Waymo has been on the radar of these companies since its origins as a secretive division of Google. But as far as symbolism goes, Waymo's operations in Michigan are hard to ignore: It's creeping ever closer to the companies that historically have defined the American automobile industry. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting elements of an autonomous vehicle future is the prospect of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AV prototypes have already safely traversed millions of miles on American roads relying on their own sensors and mapping systems. As impressive as that sounds, the ceiling of what self-driving cars can do is so much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart cities have the potential to transform infrastructure, connecting vehicles to things like traffic lights and highway cameras, which would increase the efficiency of travel and provide alerts about accidents that could reduce traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While automakers and tech companies are able to more nimbly pursue development of their own vehicles, infrastructure changes require government cooperation and can get stalled in bureaucratic red tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Michigan recently took a bold step in the right direction by partnering with Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of Michigan's State Digital Acceleration (SDA) program, a three-year initiative designed to improve digital capabilities in a variety of realms, Cisco will help create an improved infrastructure for connected and self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Building on this state's leadership in automated vehicles and connected infrastructure, Cisco will explore a partnership with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to pilot Cisco Connected Roadways throughout the state to enhance passenger and roadside worker safety," Cisco Senior Vice President Alison Gleeson wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/government/kicking-off-ciscos-first-state-digital-acceleration-sda-program-in-michigan" target="new"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing the initiative. "The technology captures real-time data about traffic flows, environmental conditions, road conditions and more, which will enable the automation of critical safety decisions like reducing speed limits on variable message signs. These integrated technologies will be key to moving Michigan toward its goal of zero highway deaths."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cisco Connected Roadways provide a centralized view of highway systems, pulling from a number of different sources, which can make it easier for officials to make decisions as well as reducing operating and maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michigan was a natural choice for Cisco to work with. The state currently ranks Number 1 in the country for connected and autonomous projects and has committed to having 350 miles of connected roadways by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The state is electric right now," Gleeson &lt;a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/10/30/cisco-michigan-digital-acceleration-state/107162722/" target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The Detroit News after announcing the initiative at the 2017 North American International Cyber Summit in Detroit. "You feel it as you walk in the city of Detroit. You feel it everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michigan governor Rick Snyder hosted the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snyder has consistently pushed policies during his time in office with the goal of making the Wolverine State open to new economic ideas, especially autonomous vehicles. Late last year, he &lt;a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2016/12/09/autonomous-car-law/95199544/" target="new"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; legislation that made Michigan one of the friendliest states in the country for autonomous vehicle development and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This unique partnership with Cisco is an opportunity to collaborate on accelerating some of the great initiatives already in place, as well as championing new ideas and solutions that will further our commitment to being a digital leader in the nation," Snyder said at the Summit.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, Volvo has ostensibly been preparing to launch an ambitious autonomous vehicle pilot program called Drive Me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was first hinted at in &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/145619/volvo-car-groups-first-self-driving-autopilot-cars-test-on-public-roads-around-gothenburg" target="new"&gt;April 2014&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href="http://www.volvo.com/home.html" target="new"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; described a fleet of 100 self-driving cars on the roads around the Swedish city of Gothenburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, the automaker noted that its cars were already capable of semi-autonomous highway driving, and were moving closer towards driving in "highly autonomous mode."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year later, in &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/158276/volvo-cars-presents-a-unique-system-solution-for-integrating-self-driving-cars-into-real-traffic" target="new"&gt;in February 2015&lt;/a&gt;, Volvo provided additional details about what exactly it planned to do with those self-driving cars. The company announced that, by 2017, those 100 autonomous vehicles would service citizens in and around Gothenburg. In April 2016, Volvo upped the ante even further, saying that its 100-car program would roll out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11380388/volvo-autonomous-cars-test-china-hakan-samuelsson" target="new"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/26/11512808/volvo-autonomous-car-drive-me-self-driving-england-uk-london" target="new"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; at the same time as Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volvo even went so far as to say that its driverless cars would operate in "unsupervised" mode on certain roadways, meaning that people in the driver's seat could read or watch movies at their leisure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those keeping a close eye on these developments have noticed that Drive Me did not launch to great fanfare in 2017. In fact, it did not launch at all. With days to spare in the calendar year, an &lt;a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20171212/COPY01/312129966/volvos-drive-me-takes-detour-on-road-to-full-autonomy" target="new"&gt;Automotive News Europe&lt;/a&gt; report revealed that Volvo's Drive Me would not only be delayed, but significantly scaled back from the self-driving program that was promised back in 2015. The Gothenburg initiative will no longer feature 100 self-driving vehicles, but rather 100 &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; as participants in the driverless trial. The "self-driving" terminology may be a stretch, too, as Drive Me cars will debut with &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/autonomous-driving-levels-0-to-5-understanding-the-differences/" target="new"&gt;Level 2 autonomy&lt;/a&gt;, something that is already available in various consumer automobiles. Volvo says it won't be able to have Level 4 autonomous systems on the road until 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"On the journey, some of the questions that we thought were really difficult to answer have been answered much faster than we expected. And in some areas, we are finding that there were more issues to dig into and solve than we expected," Volvo AV director Marcus Rothoff told Automotive News Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volvo cited numerous reasons for the delay: making sure it don't betray customer trust by releasing an unfinished product, cost-prohibitive hardware, and the difficulty of designing electrical architectures for these vehicles. But one reason stands out as rather odd: AV technology is advancing &lt;em&gt;too quickly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The development in sensor performance and processor capabilities is going so much faster than we expected in 2013," said Rothoff "Because advancements are being made at such a rapid pace, we want to make this decision as late as possible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's some logic there -- figuring out which Lidar company to hitch your wagon to is a big decision -- but the overall reasoning folds under scrutiny. How can a company that has failed to deliver a much-hyped product blame the fact that technology progressed at a rate even faster than initially expected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delays and postponements are part of business. And frankly, in an industry that is currently long on bold pronouncements and short on cars that can actually drive themselves, we'll likely see many more delays in the AV sector in the next four or five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that building driverless cars is still a very hard job, no matter how many rosy predictions knowledgeable people continue to make about their rollout. But coming to grips with this reality may help Volvo be better prepared when its autonomous vehicles are eventually ready to take the road.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Snowy and icy road conditions don't present a huge challenge to autonomous driving systems; they present huge &lt;em&gt;challenges&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snow or sleet falling from the sky can obscure the "vision" of AV sensors like Lidar and cameras, inhibiting their ability to detect the car's surroundings. Even if the sensors themselves are unobstructed, sheets of snow or ice on pavement can block lane markings, limiting an autonomous vehicle's ability to locate itself on the road. Then there's the general difficulty of navigating on icy roads. Human drivers rely a lot on feel to maneuver in slippery conditions. Programming that nebulous "feel" into a computer is a true feat of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But autonomous vehicles don't get to decide which weather they drive in. They need to be ready for all conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why so much attention has been paid to testing driverless cars in wintry conditions. Of course, that can be difficult to do in popular self-driving sites such as California and Arizona. But Finland doesn't have such problems.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is what allowed the &lt;a href="http://www.vttresearch.com/" target="new"&gt;VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland&lt;/a&gt; to develop what it says is the first self-driving car to operate independently on a real snow-covered road. The drive was accomplished in the Northern Finnish town of Muonio by a self-driving car known as Martti. It is one of two AVs designed by VTT. The other's name is Marilyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3GgJoVTHSU?rel=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martti is built on the chassis of a Volkswagen Touareg. Its journey took place on an "intelligent road" known as Aurora E8. A significant aspect of VTT's AV testing involves telematic connectivity. The organization is working to develop a 5G system across Finland. By delivering a constant stream of data about road conditions, the intelligent road setup played an essential role in enabling Martti to drive in the snow. The company says it will use similar technology to empower AVs that are built to operate off-road, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We already have at our disposal an intelligent roadside unit, capable of feeding local information for the insatiable needs of Martti and Marilyn. This cart dubbed MARSU contains measuring devices for friction data and a communications module serving as a base station," VTT project manager Matti Kutila wrote in a &lt;a href="http://www.vttresearch.com/media/news/martti-developed-for-adverse-weather-conditions-is-the-first-finnish-robot-car-to-challenge-snow-and-ice" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Furthermore, next spring one of our vehicles can also be spotted in forest environments, when Marilyn and Martti get a new friend capable of tackling all terrains."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, Martti wasn't moving along the road at a crawl. Instead, the driverless car traveled at a speed consistent with local traffic in snowy conditions. The team at VTT believes its speed may have even been a record for a self-driving car on snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It probably also made a new world record in fully automated driving, making 40 km/h [24.8 mph] in a snowfall on snow-covered terrain without lane markings," said Kutila. "It could have had even more speed, but in test driving it is programmed not to exceed the limit of 40 km/h."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.liikennevirasto.fi/web/en/e8-aurora#.WjwmPSMrJbU" target="new"&gt;Aurora E8&lt;/a&gt; is something of a hybrid between a normal road and a public testing ground for self-driving and connected cars, so VTT's claim that Martti was the first fully autonomous vehicle to operate in snowy conditions on a "real" road is open to some interpretation. But the work being done here is important regardless. If driverless cars are the future of transportation, they can't hibernate during the winter. Like a US Postal worker, neither rain nor snow can stay these AVs from their appointed rounds.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;You may have heard this story before. A tech giant sees the head of its self-driving car project leave to start his own autonomous vehicle company. The tech giant finds reason to believe its former employee stole intellectual property, and sues him and his new startup. A drawn-out drama ensues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn't the story of &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; and its lawsuit against &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/pittsburgh/self-driving-ubers/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;. However, the situation that Chinese Internet behemoth &lt;a href="http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=188488&amp;amp;p=irol-irhome" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; finds itself in is, at least in the early stages, mirroring the circumstances that played out when Waymo filed suit against its co-founder Anthony Levandowski and Uber, which acquired Levandowski's autonomous truck startup Otto. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Google, Baidu first became known as a search engine. But it has since emerged as a player in the autonomous vehicle space. Now, Baidu is suing the Chinese self-driving startup JingChi. JingChi was founded in April by Wang Jing, a former AV executive at Baidu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu is suing for 50 million yuan, the equivalent of about $7.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-uber-lawsuit/exclusive-alphabets-waymo-demanded-1-billion-in-settlement-talks-with-uber-sources-idUSKBN1CH0QC" target="new"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported that Waymo unsuccessfully demanded $1 billion from Uber to settle its case, so Badiu's suit is significantly lower stakes from a monetary perspective. But Baidu's suit also asks JingChi to cease using any allegedly stolen technology in the development of its products. If it is determined that stolen technology is fundamental to JingChi's operations, the company could be crippled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a written message to the South China Morning Post, Wang denied the allegations and stated that JingChi was preparing a more formal response to the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Baidu's lawsuit is entirely without basis. Our lawyers will respond factually and legally," Wang &lt;a href="http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2125414/chinas-baidu-sues-its-former-driverless-car-chief-over-alleged-theft" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "Our headquarters will move back to China and within two weeks we will showcase our technological capabilities."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang also told the paper that JingChi was China's leader in self-driving car technology. That claim would find few supporters, as Baidu is by far the country's best-known AV developer. Its open source autonomous driving platform &lt;a href="http://apollo.auto/" target="new"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; has over 70 partners throughout various sub-sectors of connected automotives, many of them high-profile automakers. In July, Baidu &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734772" target="new"&gt;partnered with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; to leverage the American tech company's Azure cloud platform to optimize Apollo. In September, Baidu &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736835" target="new"&gt;unveiled Apollo 1.5&lt;/a&gt; and is set to launch Apollo 2.0 in Las Vegas on January 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps there is reason for Baidu to be wary of Wang and JingChi. Less than six months into its existence, JingChi raised $52 million in a pre-A round of fundraising led by Qiming Venture and Nvidia GPU Ventures. Nvidia is among Baidu's &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/nvidia-and-baidu-team-on-ai-across-cloud-self-driving-academia-and-the-home/" target="new"&gt;most prominent partners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, Baidu -- a company whose CEO once &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734357" target="new"&gt;live-streamed an illegal ride&lt;/a&gt; in a self-driving car -- is remaining quiet regarding the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The case has now entered the judicial process and for further information please look to publicly disclosed information from the courts," the company noted in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that electric vehicles represent the future of the automotive industry, and it's hard to argue with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, running a car on electricity is considerably less expensive than using gasoline as a fuel source. There are other savings, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance costs can be far lower for electric vehicles than their fossil fuel-powered counterparts because EVs are comprised of fewer parts that need less frequent servicing. Plus, the environmental benefits of electric cars and their reduced greenhouse gas emissions becomes increasingly attractive as climate change weighs more heavily on corporate and consumer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a series of roadblocks have delayed the long-awaited spread of electric vehicles over the years. Reshaping the primary energy source for the world's foremost form of transportation is no small feat, it turns out. And in a recent interview with Bloomberg, one of the inventors of the lithium-ion battery raised another issue that EV designers ought to pay close attention to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Cars are a completely new application, and we'll have to wait until we find out what kind of batteries will really be needed," &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-26/autonomous-cars-need-tougher-batteries-lithium-ion-pioneer-says" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Akira Yoshino, who created a prototype of the lithium-ion battery in 1985. "The future of batteries depends on what will happen to the future of the automobile society."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshino's concerns have to do with emerging driverless car technology, and the ways in which it may reshape vehicle ownership models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transportation experts expect that autonomous vehicles, which will likely be electric vehicles, will cause a shift away from individual car ownership and towards ride-hailing services offered by fleet owners. Since these driverless cars can theoretically operate 24/7, Yoshino believes that the current EV battery designs will have to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A car shared by ten people means it will be running ten times more," he said. "Durability will become very important."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for Japanese chemical company &lt;a href="http://www.asahi-kasei.co.jp/asahi/en/" target="new"&gt;Asahi Kasei Corp.&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, Yoshino invented a lithium-ion battery prototype that used polyacetylene as the anode, enabling the small, rechargeable electronic devices that are now so central to modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric battery concerns recently arose when &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="new"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; unveiled its &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738351" target="new"&gt;Semi&lt;/a&gt;, an all-electric freight truck that claimed impressive performance specs. Bloomberg reporters Tom Randall and John Lippert questioned whether Tesla will be able to live up to those promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tesla's current generation of high-speed Superchargers have a power output of 120 kilowatts and can add about 180 miles to the battery in a Model S sedan in 30 minutes. But that's for a passenger car, not a loaded truck," Randall and Lippert &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-24/tesla-s-newest-promises-break-the-laws-of-batteries" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "To meet Tesla's claim of 400 miles in 30 minutes for a semi carrying 80,000 pounds would require its new Megachargers to achieve output of more than 1200 kW -- or more than ten times better than Tesla's fastest chargers available today."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would seem to support Yoshino's claim that a new battery is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What isn't yet known is whether Tesla, or some other company, has already made significant strides toward creating one. While Musk is certainly given to grand talk, it's unlikely he would want to make promises he can't deliver on. So perhaps that increasingly durable battery that Yoshino envisions isn't that far away after all.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that market predictions need to be taken with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that no one can see the future, and with so many variables affecting industry trends, all prognostications come with a healthy margin of error. This is particularly true with emerging industries where the data set around which market predictions are made is relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hitting a number exactly on the head isn't the point of these reports. Instead, they exist to show where a particular market may be headed in broad strokes. The predictions are based on more than throwing darts at a board and even if the prophecies don't come true, they still provide a trove of useful insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is through that lens that a recent report from &lt;a href="https://ihsmarkit.com/" target="new"&gt;IHS Markit&lt;/a&gt; should be viewed. The global information and analytics company explored the future of the self-driving car industry and forecasted that more than 33 million autonomous vehicles will be sold by 2040. According to IHS Markit's analysts, the AV revolution will start long before that -- but it won't begin with individual consumer ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The first autonomous vehicle volumes -- beyond retrofit test vehicles -- will arrive in 2019 through driverless mobility services," Egil Juliussen, director of automotive technology research at IHS Markit, wrote in the &lt;a href="http://news.ihsmarkit.com/press-release/automotive/autonomous-vehicle-sales-surpass-33-million-annually-2040-enabling-new-auto" target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. "Volumes will surpass 51,000 units in 2021 when personally owned autonomous cars reach individual buyers for the first time, and IHS Markit forecasts estimate nearly 1 million units will be sold in 2025 across shared fleets and individually owned cars."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This projected trend is in line with the common belief that fleet vehicles will account for the overwhelming majority of self-driving cars when the technology first hits the market. Without the need for a human driver, autonomous vehicles operating within ride-hailing services will be able to run 24/7. Fleet managers will need to take advantage of this increased uptime to justify the added expense that will come with the first wave of self-driving cars. As the technology costs come down so will vehicle costs, which will then expand the market for the driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicle sales in the US, China and Europe will account for approximately 27 million of those 33 million annual sales, according to IHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is expected to be the leader in total volume at 14.5 million units, which is influenced by the fact that its enormous population could top 1.5 billion people by 2040. The US could account for 7.4 million units per year by that point, thanks to hosting the world's foremost AV developers. And while sales in Europe could be hampered by regulations that discourage ride-hailing services from operating, IHS Markit still predicts 5.5 million annual vehicle sales across the continent by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 2040 may seem far away, IHS Markit analyst Jeremy Carlson cited &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;'s forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;AV ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix as evidence that many Americans will have the opportunity to ride in a driverless car much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We as consumers are going to start to get hands-on experience much sooner than expected," Carlson told &lt;a href="http://www.thedrive.com/sheetmetal/17298/forecast-autonomous-vehicle-sales-to-top-33-million-in-2040" target="new"&gt;The Drive&lt;/a&gt;. "Consumers are going to get exposure in a handful of cities to start with."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those early consumer experiences are one of the factors that could contribute significantly to whether or not that 33 million statistic comes true or not.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Remember Google Glass?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long before augmented reality was a widely understood term, it seemed that everyone with an interest in consumer tech couldn't wait to get their hands on a pair of the glasses, which promised to help facilitate navigation, communication and entertainment for users on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta testers, known as "Explorers," were the first to try out Google Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it didn't go so well. Users earned the nickname "Glassholes," and the nerdy aesthetic of the glasses made it so few people were particularly enthusiastic about wearing them in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Glass never became the ubiquitous wearable the company expected. (The wearable did, however, find a &lt;a href="https://www.x.company/glass/" target="new"&gt;second life&lt;/a&gt; as a high-tech industrial tool.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One moral of the story is this: Design matters. A lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, most autonomous vehicles feature hulking sensor suites on their roofs. Developers are more focused on making sure the sensors and other technology actually work than with aesthetics.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is fine in the early stages of the development process. But at a certain point in the not too distant future, the look of an autonomous vehicle is going to play an increasingly important role in customers' decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest driverless prototype from the &lt;a href="http://www.tri.global/" target="new"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; (TRI) embraces this idea. At CES, Toyota unveiled a sleek Platform 3.0 autonomous concept vehicle that looks markedly different from other self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built on the body of a Lexus LS 600hL, Platform 3.0 is founded upon three core principles: Industry-leading performance, a design that can be reproduced at scale and a distinct, sleek design that consumers want to be seen in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our team has once again rapidly advanced our automated vehicle research capabilities," TRI CEO Gill Pratt wrote in a &lt;a href="http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+research+institute+introduces+next+generation+automated+driving+research+vehicle+ces.htm" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "To elevate our test platform to a new level, we tapped Toyota's design and engineering expertise to create an all-new test platform that has the potential to be a benchmark in function and style."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat driverless cars' reputation for unsightly rooftop sensor suites that make even the clunkiest roof rack look aesthetically pleasing, TRI worked with designers at Toyota design studio CALTY Design Research to develop a more visually appealing design alternative. They dubbed their philosophy "intelligent minimalism," using available sunroof space to lower the overall height of the car's embedded sensor systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Automotive designers' roles have been pivoting toward thinking deeper and greater on how to design and apply automated driving technology for drivers and passengers," Scott Roller, senior lead designer at CALTY, noted in the release. "It's exciting to integrate the components in harmony with the car's design."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platform 3.0 is more than just a design exercise. The concept car boasts performance benchmarks like 360-degree perception that extends 200 meters, and Lidar design and positioning that makes it easier for the vehicle to detect dark objects, small objects and low-level objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While plenty of autonomous driving concepts were paraded around at CES this year, few were as pretty as TRI's Platform 3.0. As engineers continue to work to improve the system, the concept is set to soon have brains that match its impressive beauty.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In order for assisted driving to work, vehicles have to collect and process -- on-the-fly -- all kinds of data about the world around them, especially where precisely other objects are at any given moment and how fast they are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That kind of precision and, especially, low-latency can only be achieved with the new 5G technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LTE 4G is already in use by several manufacturers for non-safety critical &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/vehicle-vehicle-communication"target="new"&gt;vehicle-to-vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) applications, such as exchanging, critical but not time sensitive information including weather, road conditions and traffic data directly between vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, only the arrival of 5G, offering latencies as low as 1 millisecond, will challenge the car industry's dedicated short-range V2X technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Huawei, along with Telefonica come in. Together, the two companies, &lt;a href="https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/press-office/-/telefonica-and-huawei-complete-world-s-first-proof-of-concept-test-of-5g-v2x-radio-for-urllc-assisted-driving"target="new"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt; that they have created the first proof-of-concept (PoC) testbed that can connect two vehicles on a 5G-based V2X network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perform the test Huawei and Telefonica used the 3GPP Release 14 New Radio (NR), which was approved in December, along with non-standalone (NSA) &lt;a href="http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1930-sys_architecture"target="new"&gt;5G specifications&lt;/a&gt;. A standalone standard (Release 15) for 5G is expected this June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called &lt;a href="https://www.comsoc.org/netmag/cfp/5g-ultra-reliable-low-latency-communications"target="new"&gt;Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication&lt;/a&gt; (URLLC) mode for 5G NR offers the possibility to support services with low latency and high reliability requirements. In this PoC test, it was demonstrated that URLLC can effectively support V2X with higher system capacity and better coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main applications will be platooning, where the platoon members are controlled by the 5G NR network. In this case scenario, the Huawei and Telefonica teams have achieved 99.99 % reliability within a 1 millisecond delay constraint, and decreased signaling overhead by 67% compared with current cellular systems.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Applications of the 5G-V2X services include extended sensors, advance driving and remote parking, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5G networks offer a new level of connectivity for vehicle communications, supporting advanced use cases, such as high-throughput sensor data/map sharing among vehicles; see-through capabilities streaming camera information from one car to another; and wideband ranging for improved positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve full autonomous driving, the industry is planning to develop 5G radio specifications, as well as new NR Sidelink, which will help enable full, V2V communications.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased with our further collaboration with Telefnica in 5G technologies," said Wen Tong, CTO of Huawei Wireless and a Huawei Fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The 5G-V2X PoC is another joint effort to pave the way for commercialization of 5G and lay a solid foundation to realize the 5G vision of enabling cooperative autonomous driving," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5G, with its ability to offer Gigabit speeds, ultra-reliable low latency communication, as well as a massive number of nodes, will support the platform for the next generation of always connected vehicles of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Transportation (DOT) is to hold a public meeting on March 1 that would seek input towards a planned document regarding automated vehicles, with stakeholders including auto manufacturers set to  attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document, Automated Vehicles (AV) 3.0, will provide a framework for automation in the surface transportation system and describe the department's approach to the safe rollout of self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOT representatives have said the objectives of the public meeting are primarily to get feedback on the draft AV 3.0 Framework and identify priority federal and non-federal activities that can accelerate the safe rollout of AVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public meeting will be an open listening session to provide as great an opportunity for comment as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/regulations-fr/notices/2018-02738/"target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; all comments provided during the meeting would be oral and all written comments and presentations should be submitted to the docket for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, the DOT and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety/"target="new"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;  federal guidance for Automated Driving Systems (ADS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidance focuses on SAE International Levels of Automation 3-5 ADS, which includes conditional, high and full automation, and clarifies the guidance process, revises unnecessary design elements from the safety self-assessment and aligns federal guidance with the latest developments and industry terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With conditional automation, a driver is a necessity but is not required to monitor the environment -- however the driver must be ready to take control of the vehicle at all times upon notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High automation means the vehicle is capable of performing all driving functions under certain conditions, and under full automation, the vehicle is capable of all driving functions in all conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months and years, NHTSA, along with other federal agencies including the DOT and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), will continue to provide guidance and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Public trust and confidence in the evolution of [automated vehicles] has the potential to advance or inhibit the testing and deployment of them on public roadways," the report concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphabet, with it self-driving car project Waymo, and General Motors, the twin titans of autonomous vehicles, were the top performing companies for vehicle testing, according to automaker &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/disengagement_report_2017"target="new"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; submitted to California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As part of its regulations, California requires companies testing its self-driving vehicles on public roads to submit a report on the year's test results, including disengagements, or incidents when a human operator had to manually take over the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the public advances of advanced drive assisted driving (ADAS) systems and the high-profile cross-country self-driving vehicle trials, some in the industry are skeptical as to how soon fully autonomous vehicles are a common presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some industry experts and analysts argue it will be at least a decade before the testing phase of the technology is complete and autonomous vehicles become widespread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the public is still not sold on the safety of autonomous vehicles, according to a January survey commissioned by the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://saferoads.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AV-Poll-Report-January-2018-FINAL.pdf"target="new"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; found a majority (63%) would not support "mass exemptions" from federal motor vehicle safety standards for self-driving cars, and overwhelmingly support (75%) the DOT developing new standards related to driverless vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A consumer group wants the US Senate to scrap a bill that would streamline regulation for self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/sites/default/files/2018-02/LtrSenate020918.pdf"target="new"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; sent to senators on February 12, Consumer Watchdog cited so-called disengagement reports by companies testing autonomous cars in California. Those reports showed how often safety drivers had to take over the cars because their self-driving systems failed or didn't respond correctly to what was going on around them. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Congress shouldn't allow self-driving cars on the road if they can't actually drive themselves yet, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As it stands, this piece of legislation gives self-driving car manufacturers full authority in deciding whether or not the vehicles they manufacture are prepared to roam the streets without human supervision," the letter said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Thune of South Dakota proposed the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/srpt187/CRPT-115srpt187.pdf" target="new"&gt;AV START Act&lt;/a&gt; in November. For now, the bill is stalled because three Senate Democrats, including California's Dianne Feinstein, have placed holds on it. Safety provisions are key concerns for them. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The bill would update federal vehicle rules for vehicle safety in order to help get self-driving cars on the road. After three years, it would allow the US Department of Transportation to give exemptions for up to 80,000 autonomous vehicles per manufacturer. The bill would require manufacturers to submit safety reports, but based on a voluntary safety assessment proposed by the Department of Transportation. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The act is also intended to keep autonomous car regulation from becoming a mishmash of different state laws while the DoT formulates new federal rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Watchdog says the AV START Act wouldn't create meaningful regulation or a way to verify that self-driving cars actually work. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740229" target="new"&gt;2017 reports&lt;/a&gt; from California, which allow autonomous vehicle testing but require companies to report things like accidents and test-driver interventions, showed all companies that tested cars ran into cases where safety drivers had to take over. Twenty companies filed reports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo's cars &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/42aff875-7ab1-4115-a72a-97f6f24b23cc/Waymofull.pdf?MOD=AJPERES" target="new"&gt;went furthest&lt;/a&gt; without human intervention, going an average of 5,596 miles before a driver had to take over. The automotive arm of Google parent Alphabet reported 63 incidents in 352,545 miles. In testing by most other companies, the cars went only a few hundred miles between incidents. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Drivers had to take over because the cars executed unwanted maneuvers, incorrectly predicted what other drivers and pedestrians would do, didn't perceive their surroundings correctly, or lost their GPS signals, among other things. In some cases, the self-driving cars appeared headed for a collision when the driver intervened. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;California hasn't yet allowed cars to hit public streets without a safety driver, though it has drafted rules that might allow it. But in Arizona, where regulation is more lax, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; has tested truly driverless cars on public roads and plans to launch a driverless ride-hailing service this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cities, states and the federal government are all looking to regulate aspects of autonomous vehicles. On Tuesday, Washington, DC, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740544&amp;" target="new"&gt;launched an effort&lt;/a&gt; to get self-driving tests going in some parts of the district. Indiana lawmakers are currently &lt;a href="http://wbaa.org/post/industry-groups-divided-self-driving-car-regulations-bill#stream/0" target="new"&gt;considering&lt;/a&gt; a state law that would supersede tighter local restrictions. But the DoT and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) traditionally have taken the lead in regulating vehicles in the US. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Congress is trying to catch up with the growth of autonomous cars. Last September, the House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving/u-s-house-unanimously-approves-sweeping-self-driving-car-measure-idUSKCN1BH2B2" target="new"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; a bill similar to the AV START Act that would let manufacturers deploy as many as 25,000 cars without meeting current safety standards in the first year, rising to 100,000 after three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has indicated the president supports the bills. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Like a new boyfriend promising not to hurt them like the last one did, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi gave investment bankers a Valentine's Day speech on Wednesday that included everything but roses.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Yes, things got weird with that other guy, but I'm making everything better, he seemed to be saying. I can even be a good provider, once I get these self-driving cars and developing markets going. &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Khosrowshahi confirmed what much of the world has been saying about the company, which he took over in August after a string of scandals knocked founder Travis Kalanick out of the top job and reshaped Uber's board. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"We have a long way to go, but we have to re-earn our consumer and driver trust," Khosrowshahi told the Goldman Sachs Technology &amp; Internet Conference, according to &lt;a href=" https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/ubers-dara-khosrowshahi-we-have-a-long-way-to-go-to-regain-user-trust.html" target="new"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Uber had been battling charges of &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/21/how-one-womans-blog-post-led-to-the-fall-of-a-silicon-valley-titan/" target="new"&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/12/15/jacobs-letter-uber-spy-tactics/#435a29477f9f" target="new"&gt;spying&lt;/a&gt;, a data-breach &lt;a href=" https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-cyberattack/regulators-to-press-uber-after-it-admits-covering-up-data-breach-idUSKBN1DL2UQ" target="new"&gt;coverup&lt;/a&gt; and Kalanick just being kind of a jerk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It looked messy and it was messy," he said. Consumers' view of the company has been "appropriately negative," Khosrowshahi said. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;That's done more than make the new CEO feel bad. Uber's ride-hailing market share fell from 82% to 70% in the fourth quarter of last year, which was Khosrowshahi's first at the helm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the same quarter, the nine-year-old startup also trimmed its ongoing losses, according to reports about the selected &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740608&amp;" target="new"&gt;financial details&lt;/a&gt; the privately held company shared on a conference call with investors on Tuesday, February 13. Uber &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/ubers-net-loss-widens-to-45-billion-for-tumultuous-2017/2018/02/14/c2372f16-11c5-11e8-a68c-e9374188170e_story.html?utm_term=.6bf3d4b6626f" target="new"&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down from the $1.46 billion it shed in the last quarter of 2016. Revenue grew 65%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company even grew while it was suffering all those embarrassments: Gross revenue for the full year rose 85% to $37 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Uber could make a profit if it stopped trying to break into less-developed markets outside the US and working on self-driving cars, Khosrowshahi said -- but it won't. Uber will keep investing in Asia, and driverless cars are the only way to eventually make rides cost $1 per mile, he said. They cost about $2.50 per mile today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The autonomous car effort got a shot in the arm last week when the company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740475" target="new"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; a lawsuit by rival Waymo after four days in court. Uber made the $245 million deal to put the battle behind it, Khosrowshahi said, according to &lt;a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/14/uber-could-be-profitable-if-it-wants-to-says-ceo/" target="new"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "It was a very, very significant distraction for the teams that were working on our autonomous technology." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new CEO's &lt;i&gt;mea culpa&lt;/i&gt; for Uber's sketchy past is a likely prelude to an initial public offering, which he has indicated might take place &lt;a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/new-uber-ceo-says-ipo-is-18-36-months-out/" target="new"&gt;next year&lt;/a&gt;. Big investors, including SoftBank, which &lt;a href=" https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-28/uber-investors-are-said-to-agree-to-sell-stake-in-softbank-deal" target="new"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; about 15% of Uber in late December at a discount, will eventually need to earn a return on Silicon Valley's most valuable startup. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Uber has brought its publicly available tool for viewing and analyzing Uber trip information to its hometown of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool, called &lt;a href="https://movement.uber.com/cities?lang=en-US" target="new"&gt;Uber Movement&lt;/a&gt;, provides large sets of data about the trips that Uber cars make, along with tools for crunching that data. Anyone with an Uber account can use it. It's designed to help city officials and the public study traffic trends and predict how events or changes might affect mobility around the region. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Uber released Movement for the San Francisco Bay Area on January 30, about a year after it was introduced. The tool is already available for at least three other cities -- Boston, Cincinnati and Washington, DC -- and the company has said it plans eventually to make it available for all cities where Uber operates. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Uber has been at odds with many cities since it started disrupting taxi services and transit in 2009. But the very popularity that makes Uber look like a threat to some city agencies also gives it great visibility into the day-to-day transportation experience. As a single entity providing a large percentage of the trips made in cities, Uber can uncover a lot of information about how well the road network operates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber says Movement provides planners with better, fresher information than they can get from traditional studies, which may be years old and not as comprehensive. Plus, the data and analysis are free and easily available online, a boon to both professionals and ordinary citizens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movement data is anonymized so users can't see who took each trip, Uber says. Its main function is to show how long trips took between one area and another during a given time period, date range, or day of the week. For example, if a construction project blocked one lane of a street for a week, Movement could show how much that slowed down drivers who traveled through that part of the city. In some cases, trip data could even help to reveal where potholes are.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The tool is one step toward making Uber a part of cities' overall transportation systems rather than just a provider of cars for hire. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi described this ambitious goal in a speech to an investment banking conference last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I want to run the bus systems for a city," Khosrowshahi said, according to &lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/14/17014762/uber-softbank-dara-khosrowshahi-goldman-sachs" target="new"&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;. He also envisions Uber trips that combine modes of transportation, such as a subway ride to a station where a car -- or a bike -- is waiting for the rider to travel the last mile to their destination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some municipalities are already integrating ride-hailing services into their transportation plans. Five cities in central Florida now offer &lt;a href="https://www.altamonte.org/736/Uber" target="new"&gt;discounted Uber rides&lt;/a&gt; as a form of public transit. But in many places, Uber's relationship with transit is tense and competitive. To some, the multiple-passenger service UberPool looks alarmingly like a replacement for public buses. Some cities are &lt;a href=" http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/transportation/article194515734.html" target="new"&gt;borrowing&lt;/a&gt; aspects of the private ride-hailing experience to help their own services compete against companies like Uber. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;When emergencies arise on the road and drivers are faced with a split-second decision, it's really not accurate to say that humans make a "decision." Rather, they react instinctively to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer, however, does &lt;em&gt;makes a decision&lt;/em&gt;, even when given very little time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choices a computer makes are a direct reflection of how it was programmed to behave by the humans that created it. This brings us to the self-driving car. Autonomous vehicles need a moral baseline from which they can make difficult either-or choices in case of an accident.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, whose morals should they be using?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ethics Commission at the German Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure believes that the primary aim of self-driving cars should be to improve the safety of everyone. It's literally rule Number 1 in &lt;a href="https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/EN/Documents/G/ethic-commission-report.pdf?__blob=publicationFile" target="new"&gt;a report published&lt;/a&gt; by the comission this July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The primary purpose of partly and fully automated transport systems is to improve safety for all road users," according to the report's first rule. "Another purpose is to increase mobility opportunities and to make further benefits possible. Technological development obeys the principle of personal autonomy, which means that individuals enjoy freedom of action for which they themselves are responsible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a total of 15 rules.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other rules outlined in the report narrow in on more specific matters.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The public sector is responsible for guaranteeing the safety of the automated and connected systems introduced and licensed in the public street environment," reads Rule 3. This means the German government has taxed itself with the the heavy responsibility of ensuring that private business, in its eagerness to introduce new products, does not release underdeveloped autonomous vehicles on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an ethical standpoint, Rule 7 does the most to address an issue many have wondered about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In hazardous situations that prove to be unavoidable, despite all technological precautions being taken, the protection of human life enjoys top priority in a balancing of legally protected interests," it reads. "Thus, within the constraints of what is technologically feasible, the systems must be programmed to accept damage to animals or property in a conflict if this means that personal injury can be prevented."&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, that means if a self-driving car is faced with deciding between whether to hit a dog or a human, it will hit the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As driverless car technology -- and public acceptance of it --advances at a rate faster than most thought possible, governments and private organizations around the world are scrambling to address unanswered questions about how self-driving cars will function when they're on public roads in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German researchers have determined that once we know how we want these cars to act from an ethical perspective, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734430" target="new"&gt;it will be fairly easy&lt;/a&gt; to program them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://moralmachine.mit.edu/" target="new"&gt;At MIT&lt;/a&gt;, the aptly titled Moral Machine lets users choose how they would act in difficult traffic scenarios if given the time to do so logically. Several large companies have also teamed together to form the &lt;a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/" target="new"&gt;Partnership on AI&lt;/a&gt;, which concerns itself with these same questions and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many groups working to address these issues, it's likely that we will be able to achieve consensus before autonomous vehicles take the road en masse. And as that world takes shape in the coming years, various societies will be able to approach AVs with a popular ethical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Legendary Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca once noted: "Management is nothing more than motivating other people."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While management is much more than that, requiring high-level decision-making and a strategic vision, among many other skills, Iacocca's quote does get to the heart of an important issue. An executive is measured largely by the work of those who work underneath him or her. The single most effective way to improve a business's operations is to persuade staff members to work more effectively toward a company's goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important at young businesses and startups, where inertia doesn't exist, it has to be created. Having people with talent and vision can make or break a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also propel already promising ones into the stratosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the hope at autonomous vehicle startup &lt;a href="https://www.nauto.com/" target="new"&gt;Nauto&lt;/a&gt;, which made two high-profile hires with the addition of Jennifer Haroon as vice president of business development and operations, and Sanket Akerkar as senior vice president of global fleets and insurance. Haroon was previously head of business at &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, where she was the Alphabet company's very first business hire. Akerkar comes from &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="new"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, where he was vice president of global enterprise sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nauto's value to our clients and partners increases exponentially with scale, and we now have executives who are uniquely skilled and experienced in leading global expansion and operating within and on behalf of some of the world's most dynamic and respected companies," Nauto CEO Stefan Heck told &lt;a href="http://fleetowner.com/people/nauto-appoints-microsoft-waymo-executives" target="new"&gt;FleetOwner&lt;/a&gt;. "From our time together at McKinsey through his tenure at Microsoft, I always valued Sanket's insight and respected his leadership ability and performance. Jennifer is truly a veteran in the autonomous vehicle space, and brings an incredible network, business acumen, drive and creative thinking to Nauto. We're fortunate to have them lead our growth and to help us realize our mission to deliver smarter, safer driving around the world."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nauto is developing inward-facing vehicle safety products by designing and manufacturing technology that seeks to eliminate various forms of distracted driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using advanced artificial intelligence software, Nauto products analyze footage from in-vehicle cameras to detect when drivers are distracted. Drivers are alerted if their face displays fatigue or distraction and offered coaching after the fact on how to improve their driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734807" target="new"&gt;In July&lt;/a&gt;, Nauto announced a $159 million Series B round of financing led by investors Greylock and Softbank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At a time when traffic fatalities are climbing and distracted driving causes more than half of all crashes, we're tackling that problem by putting Nauto's safety features into more commercial fleet vehicles -- from trucks and vans to buses and passenger cars -- to warn drivers and coach them on how to stay focused," Heck said at the time. "And, in pursuit of the profoundly transformational impact autonomous vehicle technology can have on business and society, we'll now more rapidly be able to gather the billions more miles of real driving experience and data required to get a precise understanding of how the best drivers behave behind the wheel."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleet owners want to make their drivers safer and their operations more efficient. Nauto offers them an opportunity to do just that, which should make life a little easier for Haroon and Akerkar.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For years, the role of Lidar in developing self-driving cars has been a constant source of contention and concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently recognized as the coffee can-shaped device perched atop driverless prototypes from Waymo and Uber -- it has since gone on to take different physical forms -- Lidar is a sensor that sends out millions of laser pulses per second that provide an autonomous vehicle with an understanding of its immediate surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an essential component of nearly all autonomous vehicles currently in development, and yet its shortcomings are discussed as often as its merits. The limited range of detection hampers Lidar's effectiveness at high speeds, and its high price point is considered among the foremost barriers to manufacturing AVs at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in recent months, many Lidar manufacturers claim to have developed technology that solves one or both of those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the leaders in that space is &lt;a href="https://www.strobeinc.com/" target="new"&gt;Strobe&lt;/a&gt;, a three-year-old Pasadena startup that says its product "meets the required situational awareness for all levels of autonomous operation." On October 9, &lt;a href="http://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; announced that it had acquired Strobe to integrate into its AV subsidiary, &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Strobe's new chip-scale Lidar technology will significantly enhance the capabilities of our self-driving cars. But perhaps more importantly, by collapsing the entire sensor down to a single chip, we'll reduce the cost of each Lidar on our self-driving cars by 99%," Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt wrote in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/how-were-solving-the-lidar-problem-8b4363ff30db" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the acquisition. "As the cost of our self-driving vehicles declines, we'll be able to accelerate the rate of vehicle production and more quickly roll out our technology to suburban and rural areas where ride sharing is less common today."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/a-deep-dive-into-the-tech-behind-gms-new-lidar-on-a-chip-company/" target="new"&gt;an Ars Technica story&lt;/a&gt;, Timothy B. Lee dug deep into the research of Dr. John Bowers, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a board member at Strobe, to evaluate the specific potential of the company's products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Strobe brags that its technology is 'practically suited to meet chip scale fabrication requirements for the automotive market.' The kind of lidar-on-a-chip approach pioneered at UCSB is designed for manufacturing at scale," writes Lee. "Strobe also touts a 'single laser-detector pair for each unit' -- a cost-saving measure that sets it apart from conventional spinning lidars that often have 16 or 32 lasers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acquirer is as important to this development as the acquiree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM and Cruise have been making a lot of headlines of late because of the perceived advanced state of their autonomous vehicle technology. By purchasing Strobe it could be a signal that GM is even further along than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Lidar sensors contribute to the redundancy and overlapping capabilities needed to build a car that operates without a driver, even in the most challenging environments," wrote Vogt. "Our new sensors are robust to interference from sunlight, even in extreme cases, which means they can continue to operate in situations where camera-based solutions fail."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM has seen share prices &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/03/gm-shares-jump-to-record-after-bank-of-america-upgrades-to-buy.html" target="new"&gt;reach record highs&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks in accordance with news that the company may be ready to launch its self-driving cars before competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Strobe in the fold, Cruise would appear to have extended its lead in AV development.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;With a simple voice command, Alexa -- Amazon's artificial intelligence software that powers its Echo devices -- can do an awful lot. Alexa can buy your groceries, order you an Uber or stream your favorite music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Alexa can recite the latest stock quotes, one thing it can't do (yet) is make investments for you. That transaction is a little too sensitive to be trusted to voice recognition tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Amazon does make investments under the Alexa name. &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-fund" target="new"&gt;The Alexa Fund&lt;/a&gt; is an Amazon-backed venture capital fund that invests in companies that innovate in the realm of voice technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those investments took place recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late November, it was announced that the Alexa Fund was one of several investors in a $23.3 million Series B fundraising round for the Vancouver-based connected car startup &lt;a href="http://moj.io/" target="new"&gt;Mojio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mojio operates from the philosophy that every car, not just new ones, should be a connected car. With more than 1 billion cars currently on the road, it isn't feasible to expect consumers to buy a new vehicle just because of its connectivity. Instead, Mojio produces telematics hardware that, after it is installed, converts any car into a connected car. The same locational, analytical and security services that automakers offer in their new connected models can also be accessed via Mojio's platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People don't want to wait for their next vehicle to access valuable safety and security features, let alone another 10 to 15 years for the promise of self-driving cars," Mojio CEO Kenny Hawk noted in a &lt;a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/11/30/1211852/0/en/Vancouver-based-Connected-Car-Cloud-Platform-Company-Mojio-Closes-30M-Series-B-Round-and-Reinforces-Canadian-Roots.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; announcing the fundraising round. "But they are willing to spend $10 to $15 per month to access actionable, real-world data that empowers smarter decision making around family safety, driving behavior, vehicle maintenance, and that offers a hassle free WiFi hotspot that doesn't drain your smartphone."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kensington Capital, a Toronto venture capital firm, was the lead investor for Mojio's Series B round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the investors from Mojio's Series A round, which raised $15 million, stuck around for round two: The Alexa Fund, BDC IT Venture Fund, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners and Relay Ventures. Two new investors, Trend Forward Capital and Innogy Ventures, also came on board for the Series B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, Mojio is partnered with seven wireless carriers--including the Canadian big three of Bell, Rogers and TELUS--to operate in five countries. The investment from the Alexa Fund represents more than cash for Mojio. With &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mojio/dp/B0192NS6VU" target="new"&gt;Alexa (the AI, not the fund) integration&lt;/a&gt;, Mojio users can now ask their in-home Amazon Echo questions about fuel levels, vehicle maintenance, or even vehicle location if someone else is driving the car.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;While the experience of a car driving humans instead of humans driving cars is set to be a jarring transition, it's possible that things won't be drastically different for many aspects of the automotive industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of cars manufactured and sold annually could hold steady, the lifespans of the cars might remain the same, and the frequency of service could stay constant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same cannot be said for auto insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently car insurance companies business models rely heavily on the liability of the insured -- in other words, the drivers. If a self-driving car gets in an accident with another self-driving car, it is unlikely that the passenger, even one sitting in what is ostensibly the driver's seat, would be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will people still need auto insurance? And if they do who, or what, will be insured?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an article for the &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/driverless-cars-will-change-auto-insurance-heres-how-insurers-can-adapt" target="new"&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; entitled, "Driverless Cars Will Change Auto Insurance. Here's How Insurers Can Adapt," two executives from the consulting firm Accenture, John Cusano and Michael Costonis, address this issue and describe what the future will look like for the companies involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three things the $200 billion auto insurance industry can expect as self-driving cars become the norm, and what they will mean for their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Individual vehicle ownership will decline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While fewer individual people are likely to own a personal car, the amount of vehicles owned by fleet companies will skyrocket. This trend is already taking place thanks to a variety of interrelated factors that have nothing to do with autonomous systems, such as waning interest in driving among young people, accelerating patterns of urbanization, and the rise of ride-hailing services. The same self-driving cars that is prohibitively expensive for an individual could represent an immediate cost savings for corporations thanks to their ability to operate 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe that most fully autonomous vehicles will not be owned by individuals, but by auto manufacturers such as General Motors, by technology companies such as Google and Apple, and by other service providers such as ride-sharing services," write Cusano and Costonis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For insurance companies, a decline in individual car ownership will lead to lower overall premiums. That could lead to a steep drop in profit margins for the insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Fewer human drivers means fewer accidents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurance premiums are, of course, based on risk. That's why the parents of teenage drivers have to make sky-high monthly payments for their kids to get behind the wheel. But when AV systems take over, those types of calculations for individual drivers will no longer apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since as many as 94% of accidents are attributed to human error, the number and severity of accidents and insurance claims will drop, also leading to lower premiums as insurers learn to price in accordance with real risk," write Costonis and Cusano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that self-driving cars become more mainstream in 2026, the drop in vehicle ownership and the drop in accident probability, could lead to as much as a $25 billion per year loss for auto insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Change means new opportunities for insurers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news isn't all bad for auto insurance companies, so long as they are able to find ways to pivot. Cusano and Costonis list three potential new sources of revenue for car insurers when autonomous vehicles become the norm: cybersecurity, product liability and infrastructure insurance. The digital systems that underlie a self-driving car will be in need of protection, and such a role seems like a perfect fit for evolving auto insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that protecting cars against hacking, cyber theft, and ransomware attacks could generate up to $12 billion annually in additional premiums. Helping manufacturers protect themselves against the potential liability from software bugs, memory overloads, and algorithm defects represents another potential $1.5 billion annual revenue bump. And insuring things like the cloud servers that power the infrastructure assets that communicate and manage autonomous vehicles could account for $500 million per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In the aggregate, these areas can generate $81 billion through 2026 ($15 billion per year from 2020 to 2026, with some fluctuations) and can more than offset the losses in premiums expected through 2050," the pair write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while there remains plenty of uncertainty as car insurance agencies undergo a fundamental shift, it is clear that that shift represents a chance for companies to find new opportunities that are more sustainable for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;On its face, the announcement that Ford abandoned plans to build an all-electric SUV at its Flat Rock, Mich., assembly plant would seem like unequivocally bad news for American manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the outsourcing of jobs is a hot-button issue, it's widely agreed that the more manufacturing jobs that stay in the US, the better. This is especially true in and around Detroit, which, while having made great economic gains in the last decade or so, is still recovering from serious decline suffered in the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since electric vehicles are notoriously low-margin products, it's easy to see why &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; would opt to build in Mexico, where manufacturing is cheaper. But the move isn't just to clear costs, it's to clear space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using the Flat Rock facility to build electric SUVs, Ford wants to use it to produce an even more forward-looking vehicle, &lt;a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/mobility/2017/12/07/ford-flat-rock-mexico-plans/108389628/" target="new"&gt;an entirely new self-driving electric-hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yet-to-be-named car will be the foundation of Ford's forthcoming fleet of driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford said it plans to invest $200 million in the Flat Rock plant over the coming years, an investment that comes on top of the $700 that the company announced it would pour into the development of electric and autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of the new electric-hybrid AV was announced by Ford executive vice president Jim Farley in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/optimizing-our-self-driving-vehicle-to-better-serve-you-3f5d394e1df0" target="new"&gt;a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; on December 6. He cited four core characteristics of the the car and its design, saying it would be "commercial grade," "hybrid-electric," "designed for purpose," and "integrated for safety."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our commercial fleets are known for their lower cost of ownership and durability," Farley wrote. "We're applying this knowledge and experience to our self-driving vehicle so it will be ready to meet the needs of both ride-hailing and delivery businesses operating in tough urban environments. Customers will only benefit if our vehicles are on the road, versus in the shop, so this is a critical component for a successful business."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By developing a hybrid-electric autonomous vehicle, Ford is charting a unique course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevailing belief is that the autonomous vehicles of the future will be entirely electric. And many of the driverless cars being tested today are already in line with that philosophy. With its hybrid strategy, Ford is banking that its customers will place a greater value on mileage range. A hybrid-electric vehicle can travel further faster than an all-electric one because of its dual fuel sources and the lack of need for timely charging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farley also notes that the hybrid approach will assist in the specific needs of an autonomous vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Hybrids help provide the significant amount of electrical power required for self-driving sensors and computing systems without having a significant impact on the mileage," he writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford's work on this project will involve &lt;a href="https://www.argo.ai/" target="new"&gt;Argo AI&lt;/a&gt;, the Pittsburgh autonomous developer that the automaker invested $1 billion in in February. Farley notes that the Argo team has now grown to 250 employees. Argo also &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=737872" target="new"&gt;recently acquired&lt;/a&gt; Princeton Lightwave to help build out its Lidar capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a legacy big three American automaker, the launch of any new model is a big deal for Ford. The launch of a new hybrid-electric self-driving one is an even bigger deal, and one that will be coming sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farley concluded his post by saying that Ford would begin rolling out new self-driving pilot programs in 2018 and that it already had identified the first city in which to operate its autonomous vehicle business model. Finding out which city that is is one of many reasons the autonomous industry will be keeping a close eye on Ford in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Secrecy has long been a core component of the Apple corporate culture. Even when its technology is not more technically advanced than competitors, Apple's popularity usually spawns copycats for every product it makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This secrecy helps prevent Apple's competitors from getting a head start. Plus, secrecy plays a huge role in Apple's brand aura. When a company doesn't say much publicly, it allows others to speculate widely. There are entire websites dedicated to Apple rumors, and the company supports this with well-timed leaks that tend to build up to a big reveal, a tradition started by Steve Jobs and carried on by Tim Cook today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to talent acquisition, all of the secrecy can have a negative effect. It can be difficult to attract top-level engineers and designers when they don't know what projects they will be working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the backdrop for a recent presentation given by Ruslan Salakhutdinov, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;'s director of artificial intelligence.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salakhutdinov was not a featured speaker at the 2017 Conference on Neural Information Processing System (NIPS) in December, but delivered a low-profile talk to 200 artificial intelligence experts on Apple's work in machine learning, much of it pertaining to driverless car technology. The very fact that Salakhutdinov spoke at all was newsworthy since the only time most people hear from Apple execs is at those aforementioned product reveals.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the AI chief stayed true to the corporate culture and played it close to the vest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The scale and scope of any car project at Apple remains unclear," reported Tim Simonite at &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-executive-reveals-more-of-its-self-driving-technology/" target="new"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;. "Salakhutdinov didn't say how the projects he discussed Friday fit into any wider effort in automated driving, and a company spokesman declined to elaborate."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, several of the projects that Salakhutdinov detailed were being discussed publicly for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One was a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) initiative that allows vehicular software systems to generate three-dimensional maps as they're on the move. High-definition 3D mapping is a core component of self-driving cars, which is why so many companies are working to develop &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; system that becomes adopted industry-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has a head start with its widely used Maps application, but others feel Google's market domination is not a given as autonomous vehicles move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salakhutdinov also discussed a new development in vehicle, pedestrian and object recognition through images provided by cameras. He claimed that the ability of software to identify these things even when they were moving in and out of the camera's view was a significant step forward for artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salakhutdinov's presentation followed the news in November that two Apple engineers &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738551" target="new"&gt;published a paper&lt;/a&gt; exploring different uses for the Lidar technology that forms the bedrock of so many AV systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two events come after a New York Times story &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=735700" target="new"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a heavily sourced story detailing the demise of Apple's ambitions to build a self-driving car from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple would focus on AI projects, of which cars would be just one application, many read it as a sign that the company was getting out of the car business -- even though it had never officially announced it was getting into it. Now, however, as Salakhutdinov's talk shows, Apple still seems to be very much in the game.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Michigan was, unquestionably, the epicenter of the automotive industry in the 20th century. And it remains so today. But as the 21st century unfolds, another global automotive hub is emerging in a country some might find surprising: Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Michigan remains home to the big three American automakers as well as Tier 1 suppliers like the automotive seating and electrical system company &lt;a href="http://www.lear.com/" target="new"&gt;Lear Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, Israel has become a powerhouse in the development of connected cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is more an exception of who in the connected car space isn't working in Israel these days," Will Simon, president of the US-Israel Transportation Innovation Center, &lt;a href="https://securityintelligence.com/how-israel-became-the-land-of-connected-car-research-and-development/" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lear became the latest company to establish itself in Israel when it acquired &lt;a href="https://www.exactorbit.com/" target="new"&gt;EXO Technologies&lt;/a&gt; on December 11. EXO is based in Tel Aviv and specializes in developing GPS technology for connected and self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The acquisition of EXO Technologies will provide Lear with a differentiated technology to significantly improve GPS accuracy and reliability, thereby enhancing vehicle safety and enabling autonomous driving," Lear president and CEO Matt Simoncini said in a &lt;a href="http://www.lear.com/Press-Room/4451/lear-to-acquire-exo-technologies-a-developer-of-gps-technology-for-autonomous-an.aspx" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The combination of EXO Technologies with Lear's existing resources further strengthens our connectivity capabilities. We see excellent growth opportunities for our E-Systems business as the proliferation of connected and autonomous vehicles will drive increased demand for improved accuracy and reliability in vehicle positioning."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXO specializes in highly accurate GPS systems. Standard GPS systems can be thrown off by errors caused by irregularities in satellite orbits and clocks. EXO's signature software, known as &lt;a href="https://www.exactorbit.com/solutions" target ="new"&gt;PICO&lt;/a&gt;, uses a proprietary algorithm to eliminate those factors in order to make GPS units on equipped vehicles accurate within 5 to 10 centimeters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While EXO has only been around since 2015, Lear was founded in Detroit 100 years ago. A top-200 Fortune 500 company, Lear provides seating and electrical systems to every major automaker in the world. Like many automotive companies, Lear has seen ample opportunity to expand into the connected car space in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the company bought the intellectual property of vehicle communication technology developer &lt;a href="http://www.lear.com/Press-Room/4243/lear-acquires-intellectual-property-from-autonet-mobile-a-leading-developer-of-c.aspx" target="new"&gt;Autonet Mobile&lt;/a&gt; and, a few months later, acquired V2V and V2I specialist &lt;a href="http://www.lear.com/Press-Room/4279/lear-acquires-arada-systems-a-leading-automotive-technology-company-that-special.aspx" target="new"&gt;Arada Systems&lt;/a&gt;. With the higher-profile acquisition of of EXO underway, Lear is making its biggest statement yet about its position in the connected car sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXO joins a list of other Israeli connected or autonomous vehicle companies that have been acquired this year, including &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738159" target="new"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, a cybersecurity company that was purchased by Continental, and the AV vision giant &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735423" target="new"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt;, which was acquired by Intel in an enormous $15.3 billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;What will car passengers keep their eyes on when they no longer need to keep their eyes on the road?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As autonomous vehicles progress, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734361" target="new"&gt;this topic&lt;/a&gt; remains one that's long on general answers, but short on specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will probably eat differently in their cars, opting for proper meals rather than right-handing fast food burgers while steering with their left hand. They'll watch movies and play video games, surf the web and shop online -- the same things they do when they're not in a car. And they might even read, if they can avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738572" target="new"&gt;getting carsick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question isn't if AV passengers will do these things, but rather how. Operating alongside the race to get self-driving cars on the road is a race to develop compelling infotainment experiences for people getting around in self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French automaker &lt;a href="https://group.renault.com/en/" target="new"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; recently made clear that it plans to operate on both of the parallel paths, with its sights set on not only manufacturing driverless cars, but also creating the full driverless car experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renault purchased a 40% stake in Challenges Group, a French magazine publisher, whose titles include the economic weekly &lt;a href="https://www.challenges.fr/" target="new"&gt;Challenges&lt;/a&gt; and the science and technology journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/" target="new"&gt;Sciences et Avenir&lt;/a&gt;, with hopes of developing content that will be exclusive to the automaker's forthcoming self-driving cars. Claude Perdriel, who had previously owned Challenges Group entirely, retains a 60% stake and the role of CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Today, French and European commuters spend about two hours in their car every day. Claude Perdriel and Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn share the same conviction, that with the development of the connected driverless vehicle, users will have more time to spend on other activities while in the car," the two companies said in a &lt;a href="https://media.group.renault.com/global/en-gb/groupe-renault/media/pressreleases/21201612/groupe-renault-acquiert-une-participation-de-40-dans-le-groupe-de-presse-challenges" target="new"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Together, the Challenges Group and Groupe Renault have everything that is needed to create a 'lab for testing innovation' to develop new editorial content and relevant technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the same obstacles that magazine publishers face in attracting new readers in traditional settings won't disappear just because those potential readers are seated in an autonomous vehicle. Magazine publishers have long struggled to transition into digital media companies and have failed to make up for the loss of print advertising revenue. Even digital native media companies are facing a bumpy road as they try, and mostly fail, to "&lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/7/3/16045198/fox-sports-mtv-news-vocativ-layoffs-pivot-to-video-77e441a49cb7" target="new"&gt;pivot to video&lt;/a&gt;." It's somewhat difficult to imagine a medium-sized French publisher paving the way for the on-road entertainment of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jalopnik called the acquisition "&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/in-insane-move-renault-buys-stake-in-media-company-to-1821270563" target="target"&gt;insane&lt;/a&gt;," primarily because Renault seems to be putting the cart before the horse. Renault doesn't expect its driverless car to be ready for another five years, so investing in a media company at this point seems a bit premature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The hurdles [for autonomous vehicles] -- regulations, public adoption, the technology itself actually working -- are sky-high to clear, but Renault felt it's worth the risk," wrote tech reporter Ryan Felton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While autonomous vehicles do face a series of obstacles before becoming commonplace on our roads, it's an impending reality in which automakers, tech companies and venture capitalists have already invested billions upon billions of dollars. To a certain extent, the autonomous vehicle industry may be approaching "too big to fail" status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean that driverless cars can save print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Renault and Challenges acknowledged in their joint statement: "In France, 5,000 newspaper kiosks are going out of business every year." And the novelty of reading a periodical in a self-driving car probably isn't enough to alter the public's media consumption habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that companies like Intel and Warner Bros. are working on &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738753" target="new"&gt;immersive Batman experiences&lt;/a&gt; for the self-driving car that utilize augmented reality doesn't make things any easier for the already-challenged magazine industry.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous-car promoters say the technology they love will someday do many great things for humanity, including making roads safer and helping the elderly get around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to a &lt;a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/228032/americans-hit-brakes-self-driving-cars.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="new"&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt; released February 21, robot vehicles have already done the impossible: Unite Americans of all ages, genders, regions and educational backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young and old, college-educated or not, more adults across the US are worried about self-driving cars and trucks than are feeling gung-ho about them, Gallup found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those results, which are based on interviews with nearly 3,300 US adults, are the latest evidence that while carmakers and Silicon Valley companies are heading into the autonomous future at top speed, many of the consumers they expect to buy into the new technology still prefer to go slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: 54% of US adults say it's unlikely they'll even use fully self-driving cars. Only 25% say it's likely. Even among those 18 to 35, only 36% expect to take the leap. Americans with college degrees think it's iffy (39% to 38%), while those with less education overwhelmingly doubt they'll go driverless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallup's findings echo those of a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740709&amp;" target="new"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; released this week by TV Rheinland, which found that many consumers in the US and Europe don't trust self-driving cars -- though those in China are much more open to the new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Gallup asked 3,297 US adults about their feelings on a scale from "extremely uncomfortable" to "extremely comfortable."&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Riding in a self-driving car every day would make 59% of Americans uncomfortable, the survey found. More than two-thirds of those over age 66 gave that response, but even among 18-to-35-year-olds, half said they wouldn't be comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education may open consumers up to the idea a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 45% of people with a bachelor's degree were uncomfortable with the idea -- but only 33% actually said they were comfortable with it. For those with less education, the split was 65% to 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing the road with self-driving trucks drew even stronger reactions. Overall, 62% of those surveyed said they were uneasy about getting on the road with robot trucks, and only 20% said it would be OK. Again, about half of the youngest group wasn't quite ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results may be bad news for those who want legislators and the public to embrace autonomous vehicles. Entire industries, including ride-hailing and &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603493/10-breakthrough-technologies-2017-self-driving-trucks/" target="new"&gt;long-haul trucking&lt;/a&gt;, have a lot riding on self-driving technology to cut costs and scale up their businesses. Tens of billions of dollars have been invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if consumers don't buy in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740086" target="new"&gt;retirement communities&lt;/a&gt; are considered a key early market for driverless ride-hailing, due to quiet streets and residents who've had to give up driving, yet more than two-thirds of people over 66 told Gallup they don't think they'll ever use a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be hard times ahead, but here's a potential glimmer of hope: &lt;a href="http://news.gallup.com/vault/227810/gallup-vault-misjudging-cellphone-adoption.aspx?g_source=link_newsv9&amp;g_campaign=item_228032&amp;g_medium=copy" target="new"&gt;In 2000&lt;/a&gt;, about one in five adults (not even counting seniors) told Gallup they would never get a cellphone. Now, 95% of Americans have one. Maybe the other 5% just can't find it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Automotive cybersecurity specialist Argus Cyber Security announced a partnership with connectivity and communications service provider Ericsson to offer cybersecurity tools for connected cars, which will include cloud-based services delivered to fleets as well as individual vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies will work together to help enable automakers to securely integrate and monetize the connected vehicle ecosystem. The partnership was announced February 26 at the start of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaboration involves integrating Argus Security Operation Center with Ericsson's Connected Vehicle Cloud platform to provide automakers with an additional layer of security that leverages intelligence findings across both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of Argus's and Ericsson's offerings is aimed at providing automakers cyber security coverage of the cloud, connected services and entire vehicle fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The combined insights provide automakers with actionable intelligence derived from big data analysis across millions of connected vehicles and their cloud services to identify the first signs of an attack campaign and mitigate its damage by rapidly immunizing the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaboration leverages Ericsson's communications expertise, built over 140 years and from connecting billions of people through connectivity infrastructure, and Argus' experience in cyber security and automotive, as well as the innovation of 39 granted and pending patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argus connectivity protection defends the infotainment or telematics units by preventing malware installation, detecting operating system anomalies, isolating suspicious applications and stopping attacks spreading to the in-vehicle network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, this suite secures the two-way communication channel with the outside world and operates across platforms -- Linux, QNX, Android and others -- to protect the car's most vulnerable attack surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's electric control units (ECU) protection technology protects different parts of the car, such as brakes, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), door control units or any other units deemed critical, from attacks originating inside and outside of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located on the ECU, this suite detects and prevents incoming attacks, as well as neutralizes malware resulting from supply chain attacks or other attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In order to enable an increasing number of vehicle cloud services to interact with a vehicle, we see the need for a holistic cyber security strategy, which demands multi-layered, end-to-end cyber security covering every node in the ecosystem, throughout a vehicle's lifespan," Yoni Heilbronn, chief marketing officer for Argus Cyber Security, noted in &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/argus-cyber-security-collaborates-with-ericsson-to-spearhead-seamless-end-to-end-cyber-security-across-connected-services-and-vehicles-300603771.html/"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heilbronn explained that through the partnership with Ericsson, Argus is looking to help automakers ensure the security and privacy of their customers through comprehensive cyber security solutions and services, while simultaneously maintaining consumer trust and brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Argus' multi-layered cyber security solutions embedded in the vehicle provide real-time protection from cyber-attacks, including attacks on remote vehicle commands originating from the cloud, such as heating the interior cabin and opening the vehicle door, through a smartphone applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are offering a proposition for automotive OEMs through the combination of Ericsson's Connected Vehicle Cloud's ability to manage a large number of connected vehicles with an in-vehicle expert like Argus and its capabilities for vehicle protection and threat detection," Claes Herlitz, head of connected vehicles at Ericsson wrote in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argus, an independent company of Elektrobit, a provider of automotive software products and services, also offers an over-the-air (OTA) software update tool that enables them to improve performance and security, as well as deploy new features throughout the vehicle's lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Mercedes-Benz parent company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740802&amp;"target="new"&gt;Daimler and Bosch let the world know&lt;/a&gt; they are partnering on a self-driving taxi that would begin testing itself on city streets in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Ford and Miami-Dade County are teaming up to test autonomous vehicles on the streets of Miami and Miami Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tenth-most congested city in the world and the fifth-most congested city in the US, Ford is looking to test how self-driving cars can reduce commute times and improve the efficiency of delivery-based businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of Ford's presence will involve pilot programs throughout the year that includes partners such as Domino's and Postmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knowledge gained from this customer experience research will be applied to the design of Ford's purpose-built self-driving vehicle that the company plans to launch in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've spent years researching and developing self-driving technology, studying changing customer behaviors, serving some of the largest fleets in the country with help from our dealers, and working with governments big and small," Sherif Marakby, Ford's vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/02/27/we_re-going-to-miami--the-first-proving-ground-for-our-self-driv.html/"target="new"&gt;February 27 statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Now it's time to pull it all together and head for the finish line."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the announcement, Ford also released a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=k4g8c3XR8f8/"target="new"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; with footage of its test vehicles already cruising the city's sun-washed streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marakby also noted Ford would continue to develop the self-driving technology powering its vehicles by expanding testing in partnership with Argo AI platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A new fleet of Argo vehicles is already on the streets, mapping the roads and accumulating miles that will help us improve the way they move through cities," Marakby explained. "The effort will grow throughout the year as we add vehicles and expand areas of testing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford's announcement follows recent developments in other states, as legacy automakers, government agencies and tech startups grapple with the implications of self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States such as California and Arizona are already hosting advanced tests for self-driving vehicles, and Washington DC's mayor is paving the way similar testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Massachusetts held a Statehouse briefing on autonomous vehicles to explore the concerns and benefits of introducing self-driving vehicles to the state's roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, the state's governor Charlie Baker &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-baker-creates-commission-on-the-future-of-transportation-in-the-commonwealth/"target="new"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Executive Order No. 579 establishing the commission on the Future of Transportation in the Commonwealth to advise the Baker-Polito Administration on future transportation needs and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Indiana, a Senate committee recently took testimony on &lt;a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2018/bills/house/1341/"target="new"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; to regulate autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill proposes a series of regulations guided by oversight panels compromised of state departments of insurance and transportation leaders, and would also bar local governments from banning self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740807&amp;/"target="new"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; currently moving through the Utah legislature would legalize self-driving cars across the state and set up licensing, registration and insurance rules for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a national level, Embark Technology, a startup developing self-driving trucks, announced this month it had completed a coast-to-coast, 2,400-mile journey from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Fla. test drive with a semi-autonomous truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embark started delivering refrigerators along a 650-mile stretch of Interstate 10 from El Paso, Texas, to Ontario, Calif., in October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Waymo's 360-degree video of a driverless Chrysler Pacifica makes a ride in one look fun and safe, especially with all the animations showing how parts of the technology work.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8R148hFxPw" target="new"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; may help the Google-backed autonomous driving company sell &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740775" target="new"&gt;wary consumers&lt;/a&gt; on cars with no one at the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at less than four minutes long, it leaves out some of the details that complicate the vision of a driverless future. Here are five things you won't learn from Waymo's video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1. Some places aren't so easy to navigate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Waymo shows a driverless car in a developed suburban area on a sunny day. It uses animation to show how the car senses everything around it, such as lanes, signals and crosswalks. It uses a combination of Lidar to build a detailed view of the surroundings, radar to detect objects and their speed, and cameras to capture things like the colors of traffic lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's probably an accurate depiction of how Waymo's cars navigate the Phoenix area, where the ride service is set to launch this year.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;But Waymo is launching in Phoenix for a reason, and it's not just that the state of Arizona allowed it. It's a modern city with relatively wide, well-marked streets and mostly clear weather. Less developed areas, &lt;a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/gms-cruise-explains-why-self-driving-tests-in-dense-cities-gives-it-an-edge/" target="new"&gt;jam-packed cities&lt;/a&gt; and regions with &lt;a href=" http://www.autonews.com/article/20160210/OEM06/160219995/self-driving-cars-succumb-to-snow-blindness-as-driving-lanes-disappear" target="new"&gt;tougher weather&lt;/a&gt; are harder for self-driving cars to master.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Engineers everywhere are working to solve those problems, and Waymo's minivans may even be ready to take them on. But what its video shows is more of a best-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;2. Self-driving cars still need help sometimes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
For all the talk of cars going driverless, we're not quite at the stage where autonomous Chevrolet Bolts and Chrysler Pacificas are going to head off on romantic weekends together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Disengagement reports" required from all companies testing in California show that last year, each faced situations where human operators had to take over. The reasons included software failures, impending crashes and unexpected actions by pedestrians or other drivers. Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740572" target="new"&gt;led the pack&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 with just 63 disengagements in 352,545 test miles, but that was still an average of one every 5,596 miles. Most other companies had to take over their cars every few hundred miles. Even when it starts allowing cars with no one in the driver's seat next month, California will make companies prove humans can take over their cars remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B8R148hFxPw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean users of Waymo's service will get stranded while their cars figure out what to do. But think of this generation of vehicles as teenagers who just got their licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;3. It's more than learning from 'experience'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What makes everything you can see right now possible is experience. Waymo has already self-driven millions of miles on complicated city streets, and it's constantly learning from every single mile it drives," the narrator claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting fine-grained data about every trip, plus additional miles traversed in simulations, does help autonomous driving platforms interpret what they see and predict how others will behave. But making multiple driving decisions per second also takes advanced &lt;a href=" https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/advanced-cars/deep-learning-makes-driverless-cars-better-at-spotting-pedestrians" target="new"&gt;algorithms&lt;/a&gt; -- or even &lt;a href=" https://qz.com/1204395/self-driving-cars-trolley-problem-philosophers-are-building-ethical-algorithms-to-solve-the-problem/" target="new"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; translated into code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may give an edge to companies like Waymo, which grew out of Google and is part of its parent company, Alphabet. Software is invisible, but it matters as much as the gear around the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;4. An autonomous car is a mobile device&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Waymo's video shows a cool, smart vehicle that knows how to get around by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But self-driving cars are part of complex systems that include onboard technology, cloud-based services and -- eventually -- roadway infrastructure. How much intelligence will reside in the car and how much in the cloud is still up for debate. Wireless networks, eventually using 5G, will play important roles -- and might raise &lt;a href=" http://www.businessinsider.com/how-5g-will-drive-the-adoption-of-self-driving-cars-2017-12" target="new"&gt;coverage issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, Intel, China's Baidu and other companies are building &lt;a href=" http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-hy-self-driving-maps-20180221-story.html" target="new"&gt;navigation platforms&lt;/a&gt; that use constant sensor data from cars to maintain a comprehensive map in the cloud. Wireless networks for cars and nearby infrastructure, such as &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740852&amp;" target="new"&gt;C-V2X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740672" target="new"&gt;WLANp&lt;/a&gt;, could provide traffic warnings and eventually trigger automatic braking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;5. Your automated ride may someday be 'free'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
This one is just speculation so far, but driverless cars may even change the way we pay for rides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how that might happen: Eliminating the driver is expected to slash the cost of getting driven across town. (Uber predicts average cost per mile will fall from $2.50 to $1.) At that price, local businesses might decide it's worth giving away rides just to get people in the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The store or restaurant might be &lt;a href=" http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/01/technology/future/free-transportation-self-driving-cars/index.html" target="new"&gt;the destination itself&lt;/a&gt; or just &lt;a href=" https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/self-driving-cars-free-future/548945/" target="new"&gt;a mandatory stop&lt;/a&gt; along the way where there's a good chance riders will spend some money.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Even if it never actually pays for the rides, marketing will probably help to make the rides pay off. Ride-hailing companies already know where you are, where you're going, and what spots you often visit. It's a perfect captive audience for advertisers -- if they can get you to stop staring at a car driving itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;This week at the Geneva Auto Show, Volkswagen officially debuted a school bus version of its awkwardly named SEDRIC (SElf DRIving Car), and the I.D. Vizzion concept car, which the company calls a "saloon" that riders can control through augmented reality, gestures and voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German automaker will bring the Vizzion to market in 2022, although it will initially launch with conventional controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to augmented reality features, which entail the use of virtual control elements and displays projected inside the car, the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740702"target="new"&gt;Vizzion is essentially a rolling smart device&lt;/a&gt; that acts like a chauffeur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring that vision to reality, Volkswagen has altered the layout of the vehicle's interior to reflect that new roll of all occupants as passengers -- think of the Vizzion as a living room on wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives the company a potential advantage in the large sedan market, as the lounge-like interior offers more space than any other vehicle in its category, with a panoramic moonroof spread overhead.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;While some analysts are skeptical as to when Level 5 automation -- vehicles fully capable of operating and reacting to unforeseen road conditions without human control -- will become a reality, Volkswagen claims driving at that level is already conceivable starting in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The all-electric vehicle architecture is also scalable, which means Volkswagen can adapt the drivetrain to vehicles of various sizes, including SUVs; busses; and smaller, sportier cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We plan to build around one million all-electric vehicles per year already by 2025," Dr. Herbert Diess, chairman of the Volkswagen Brand board of management, noted in a March 6 &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/detailpage/-/detail/Volkswagen-world-premiere-in-Geneva-The-ID-VIZZION--the-saloon-for-tomorrow-and-beyond/view/6334652/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da?p_p_auth=zj6znCYK/"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, noting the compact I.D. and the I.D. Crozz SUV would make their debut in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The I.D. Buzz large capacity passenger vehicle -- essentially the company's iconic Microbus reconstituted for the 21st century -- will follow those models in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Volkswagen took the wraps off the latest family member of the SEDRIC concept car line in the form of a &lt;a href="http://www.discover-sedric.com/en/"target="new"&gt;futuristic school bus&lt;/a&gt;, following the original SEDRIC, SEDRIC 42 and SEDRIC Nightlife models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons to school busses of the past end with the conventional yellow paint job -- Volkswagen's Self-Driving System (SDS) concept has the option of using the OneButton control element to call up the self-driving electric vehicle with one button and collect students door-to-door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed in a monolithic form with thick body pillars, roomy interior and yellow and black color scheme -- with stylized graffiti accents no less -- the youthful look of the vehicle is aimed at providing an inviting and fun experience, which continues into the interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside, aluminum boxes decorated with stickers form the basis for two of the four seats, while the front windscreen is designed as a large-format OLED screen and provides onboard entertainment, and is presumably chewing gum resistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is part of the company's goal of becoming a global leader in autonomous driving under the Together 2025 plan, a goal long in the making. It started in 2005 as a partnership between the Volkswagen Electronics Research Lab and Stanford University resulted in victory at the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, widely considered the dawn of the automated vehicle era.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Waymo, the self-driving car division of Google's parent company Alphabet, is working rental giant Avis to help manage its fleet of connected cars, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the agreement is limited to the Chrysler Pacifica minivans that &lt;a href=" https://waymo.com/"target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; has in Phoenix. The minivans are being used as part of a ride-hailing service that Waymo is testing in the city with volunteers. Residents in the Phoenix area who sign up and are accepted to Waymo's &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/apply/" target="new"&gt;early rider program&lt;/a&gt; are able to use the minivans to help them get around, whether that's commuting to the office or dropping kids off at soccer practice. In exchange for rides, volunteers in the program provide Waymo's team with feedback about the self-driving cars that the company will use to improve its service and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With members of the public using our growing fleet of self-driving cars, our vehicles need standard maintenance and cleaning so they're ready for our riders at any time of the day or night," Waymo CEO John Krafcik told &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/alphabet-inks-deal-for-avis-to-manage-self-driving-car-fleet"target="new"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. "Avis Budget Group is an ideal partner to provide fleet support and maintenance. With thousands of locations around the world, Avis Budget Group can help us bring our technology to more people, in more places."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In expanding the early rider program, Waymo added 500 new self-driving Pacifica minivans to its fleet of 100 that were already being tested on public roads. All the vehicles are owned by Waymo, but under the new agreement -- financial terms of which were not disclosed -- Avis will be responsible for servicing and storing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/"target="new"&gt;Avis&lt;/a&gt; is not buying any additional real estate, but will retrofit existing properties in the Phoenix area to accommodate the special needs of the autonomous cars, such as installing special tents to prevent them from getting rained on. Avis will also provide standard vehicle servicing, including oil changes, cleaning and tire rotation. The rental car company will not, however, be responsible for maintaining the tech hardware in the Waymo minivans, including the Lidar sensors that help the car measure its distance from surrounding objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Waymo vehicles don't need to be taken out of service to accommodate human concerns such as driver fatigue, the company expects its cars to be on the road much more than a standard one. The additional driving time will therefore require additional maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership, according to Bloomberg, is the first major one involving management of driverless vehicle fleets, allows Avis to gain a foothold in an industry that has the potential to disrupt the traditional rental car model.&lt;/p&gt;
"It's important for us to get involved now," Avis Chief Executive Officer Larry De Shon told the publication. "This just demonstrates that we can extend our business into fleet-management-as-a-service."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Alphabet and Waymo, the deal gives them access to a large network of cars and customers. While the current partnership is limited to the driverless Pacificas in Phoenix and is not exclusive, being aligned with Avis could provide Waymo with an easier way to add its technology to a greater number of vehicles in the future. Additionally, Avis owns the on-demand rental car company &lt;a href="http://www.zipcar.com/" target="home"&gt;Zipcar&lt;/a&gt;, which has more than 1 million members, and the door is open to potentially expanding the deal in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current agreement was hatched relatively quickly, with formal negotiations getting underway in January. The deal is expected to go into effect later in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;First Transit, the US subsidiary of British transportation company FirstGroup, has signed an agreement with GoMentum Station to continue its research of shared autonomous vehicles at the Concord, Calif. testing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In December 2016, First Transit &lt;a href="http://www.firsttransit.com/about-us/news/news-details/2016/12/06/first-transit-announces-first-autonomous-passenger-shuttle-pilot-in-north-america-with-easymile" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the first autonomous vehicle passenger shuttle pilot in North America. 
&lt;p&gt;That announcement came in partnership with EasyMile, a French startup that specializes in designing software for self-driving vehicles. By autumn of this year, First Transit and EasyMile plan to pilot an autonomous shuttle in San Ramon -- California's Bishop Ranch Office Park -- that will transport commuters between other transit options within the office park, including buses and bike-sharing services.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Now, First Transit will have the opportunity to test its shuttle at the world's largest secure autonomous vehicle test facility -- GoMentum Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owned by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, the 5,000-acre station offers the world's leaders in developing autonomous vehicle technology a state-of-the-art site for the testing of their products. The station's size allows for various types of terrain. Such a component is essential for developers of many autonomous vehicles. First Transit's shuttle will travel on pre-programmed routes throughout Bishop Ranch Office Park.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;First Transit will test two shuttles at GoMentum Station, and the agreement between the entities stipulates that First Transit will provide staffing, maintenance and support for the vehicles while testing them at the GoMentum. For First Transit -- or any other company -- having a large number of boots on the ground means increased opportunities for networking and potential collaboration with public and private entities.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gomentumstation.net/about/"target="new"&gt;GoMentum Station touts&lt;/a&gt; that it is "bringing together automobile manufacturers, communications companies, technology companies, researchers and public agencies with the aim of accelerating the next generation of transportation technologies." The station breaks down the types of autonomous vehicles it provides testing for into three groups: private, shared and commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Transit's shuttle falls into that middle group, which may be the least discussed of the three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the time approaches when self-driving vehicles become commonplace on our roads, however, that dynamic may soon start to shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early adoption of self-driving car technology will be prohibitive for the vast number of private citizens, while companies with large fleets of commercial vehicles will face a slow transition to AV technology for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared vehicles, however, seem like ripe candidates to be among the first self-driving automobiles on our streets. City buses, for example, travel premeditated, recurring routes, presumably making their programming easier than that of a vehicle that embarks on different trips each day. Consider the vast number of people that city buses transport within major metropolitan area, and the public funding of self-driving buses seems like an easy sell.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Of course, if all goes according to plan, First Transit's shuttle will be in operation long before that day comes. If successful, the First Transit shuttle and other projects like it may be influential in improving the public's attitude towards self-driving vehicles. If people have daily positive interactions with self-driving shuttles in and around their workplaces, they will likely think more favorably of autonomous vehicles at large.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The surface is only being scratched when it comes to how the Internet of Things (IoT) will affect our lives. But Cisco Jasper has taken a major step toward enabling enterprises of all sizes to explore what that future might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cisco Live! in Las Vegas, Cisco Jasper revealed its &lt;a href="https://www.jasper.com/products"target="new"&gt;new Control Center 7.0 platform&lt;/a&gt;. The solution is multi-tiered so that businesses, regardless of size or how far along they are in the development, can be empowered to get their applications off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco Jasper has seen its customers grow from 3,500 to 11,000 in the past year. Despite that growth, the company found that &lt;a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1862554"target="new"&gt;60% of IoT initiatives&lt;/a&gt; still get hung up at the proof-of-concept phase. It designed Control Center 7.0 to help customers get over that all-important hump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We first introduced our Control Center IoT connectivity management platform to the market over 10 years ago, and since then it has become the largest IoT platform with over 43M devices being managed today, and more than 1.5M new devices being added per month," Jahangir Mohammed, general manager of IoT at Cisco Control Center 7.0, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1862554"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "What we've learned from enabling IoT success for our 11K customers is that companies have different needs at different stages of their IoT journey."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address those needs, Control Center 7.0 offers multi-tiered solutions and premium services designed to provide greater flexibility to customers. True to its name, Control Center 7.0 offers greater control. Two of the new premium services available to customers are Threat Protection &amp; Smart Security (TPSS) and Traffic Segmentation that will allow customers to be better protected and better equipped for different revenue models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPSS is designed to protect against the malware and other cybersecurity threats that are as much a concern for end users as they are for developers. End users will be hesitant to adopt IoT applications if they feel their security could be compromised, so Cisco Jasper designed Control Center 7.0 to identify and analyze threats via the network, including when WiFi is being used. The security capabilities are further enhanced with closed user groups, two-factor authentication, and whitelisting features. There is also a user audit trail so that there is better tracking of user actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic Segmentation provides clearer visibility for developers to know exactly how their services are being utilized. By enabling data traffic and usage information to be segmented, enterprises can generate sharper, more granular insights into their business and utilize those insights to do everything from developing new services that add value to more accurately billing back third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while earlier Control Center editions ran exclusively on traditional cellular services, Control Center 7.0 now has the ability to support low-power devices via LTE-M and NB-IoT that can reduce connectivity costs and extend battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control Center 7.0 highlights the core capabilities that Cisco hoped to grow when it acquired Jasper last year. "When we acquired Jasper, we made a promise to the industry that Cisco and Jasper would be more than the sum of our separate parts -- that we would create something better together," Rowan Trollope, senior vice president and general manager of IoT and Applications at Cisco, wrote in a statement. "This is the realization of that promise."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new platform is available now, which means it's only a matter of time before we start seeing the applications that enterprises use the software to create. Because as great as the potential for IoT is, it is very much contingent on the platform the technology sits on. And with Control Center 7.0, developers now have a solution that could rapidly advance the timetable of their projects.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a set of bills that are under consideration by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, as well as a series of partnerships forged by various companies working on the design of self-driving cars, June was arguably the most auspicious month ever for the autonomous vehicle industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the month, working drafts for a &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/338669-house-panel-to-explore-14-driverless-car-bills-next-week" target="new"&gt;set of 14 bills&lt;/a&gt; focused on autonomous vehicle legislation was circulated to members of Congress and their staff for consideration, as well as representatives from various corners of the self-driving car industry for their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that input from everyone involved will strengthen the legislation before it hits the floor later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the single most noteworthy proposed bill in the package is the &lt;a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF17/20170627/106182/BILLS-115pih-PAVEAct.pdf" target="new"&gt;Practical Autonomous Vehicle Exemptions Act&lt;/a&gt;, or the PAVE Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Secretary of Transportation has a cap of 2,500 federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) exemptions. PAVE proposes increasing that number to 100,000, a move that would widely increase the number of self-driving cars that would be allowed for testing on public roads. Real-road trials yield remarkably valuable information to those testing autonomous vehicle technology, and opening up such opportunities would accelerate innovation in performance and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dramatically increasing the number of autonomous vehicles allowed on the road in a single fell swoop has the potential to sway the public perception of self-driving cars in ways good and bad, and the House committee plans to make conscious efforts to ensure that the outcomes in that arena are largely positive. The &lt;a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF17/20170627/106182/BILLS-115pih-EXEMPTAct.pdf" target="new"&gt;Expanding Exemptions to Enable More Public Trust (EXEMPT) Act&lt;/a&gt; would encourage the Secretary of Transportation to issue a large number of its FMVSS exemptions to autonomous vehicles that would give the public a favorable view of the technology, such as easily accessible buses, shuttles, or vehicles designed to transport the disabled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EXEMPT is one of several bills in the package that emphasizes the capability of autonomous vehicles to open up new transportation opportunities for the disabled or disadvantaged. The Disability Mobility Advisory Council Act would create a council whose job would be to do just that, while the Improving Mobility Access for Underserved Populations and Senior Citizens Advisory Council Act would create another council specifically to advise on how self-driving vehicles can best be of service to "populations underserved by traditional public transportation services," including senior citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such proposals from the public sector served as an encouraging sign for the progress of self-driving cars, so did a trend of collaboration among various private companies that are players in the emerging industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two big-name players in AV development struck agreements with rental car companies, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/alphabet-inks-deal-for-avis-to-manage-self-driving-car-fleet"target="new"&gt;Waymo partnered with Avis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/26/hertz-shares-soar-after-report-apple-working-to-manage-small-autonomous-fleet.html"target="new"&gt;Apple teamed up with Hertz&lt;/a&gt;, gaining access to large fleets of vehicles and companies that have unmatched experience in managing them. Many have assumed that old-school rental car companies would be victims of the autonomous vehicle industry, so their active participation in it is good news for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other announcements from the private sector brought further indication that the industry has taken off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chipmaker &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/06/27/nvidia-volkswagen-volvo-self-driving-cars-ai-intel.html"target="new"&gt;Nvidia will develop&lt;/a&gt; deep learning software to improve environmental recognition in forthcoming Volvo and Volkswagen cars, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15792422/gm-self-driving-chevy-bolts-rides-roads"target="new"&gt;GM revealed&lt;/a&gt; that 130 more self-driving Chevy Bolts will join the 50 that already cruise the streets of San Francisco, Scottsdale and Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, June's seemingly ceaseless activity represents a high point on the timeline of autonomous vehicle development. Of course, with AV work in the public and private spheres only accelerating, June may look like only the beginning in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;You're driving late at night down a dark, winding road. As you turn a sharp corner, an old man and his dog suddenly appear on the road in front of you. Without time to fully brake, do you plow into the man and his pet? Or do you swerve into a ravine, risking your own life in the process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do in this hypothetical situation, it's hard to think of it as a "decision." When faced with split-second situations on the road, drivers "react" more than they decide. It's because of that fact we rarely hold drivers accountable for ascribing any sort of logic to what they do when confronted with two devastating choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same understanding won't be extended to autonomous cars when they are involved in accidents on the road. Every move a self-driving car makes -- including those made in fractions of a second -- is the result of how human beings programmed it to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to challenging hypotheticals like the one described above, such questions are no longer theoretical. Engineers must determine ahead of time how our autonomous vehicles should act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such moral questions are inherently difficult and complex, a recent study shows that establishing a human consensus on them and transferring the resulting value systems into self-driving cars may not be so hard. In &lt;a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00122" target="new"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; published by Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, researchers from The Institute of Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabruck in Germany put people in virtual reality driving simulations, which yielded predictable patterns of decision-making that could serve as the foundation for an autonomous vehicle's thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the study, participants controlled a virtual car and had to choose which of two given obstacles they would sacrifice in order to spare the other. We randomly sampled obstacles from a variety of inanimate objects, animals and humans," researchers wrote in their article: "Using Virtual Reality to Assess Ethical Decisions in Road Traffic Scenarios: Applicability of Value-of-Life-Based Models and Influences of Time Pressure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our model comparison shows that simple models based on one-dimensional value-of-life scales are suited to describe human ethical behavior in these situations," according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute of Cognitive Science's work is not the first experiment with how people approach ethical dilemmas in traffic accidents. M.I.T.'s &lt;a href="http://moralmachine.mit.edu/" target="new"&gt;Moral Machine&lt;/a&gt; collects user data on decisions made between two car crash outcomes, albeit in a less high-tech way. Some of the scenarios presented require some deep thinking: Should a car with malfunctioning brakes stay its course and run over senior citizens legally crossing the street, or should it swerve to instead hit teens illegally crossing the street? The situations are hyper-specific -- not to mention unlikely -- but the data collected from them can produce some revealing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerful corporate entities are concerned with the moral quandaries of artificial intelligence. A group of companies including &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=652"target="new"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=956"target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=664"target="new"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=723"target="new"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; are members of &lt;a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/" target="news"&gt;The Partnership on A.I. to Benefit People and Society&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to develop best practices in artificial intelligence in technology such as autonomous vehicles. "Where AI tools are used to supplement or replace human decision-making, we must be sure that they are safe, trustworthy, and aligned with the ethics and preferences of people who are influenced by their actions," according &lt;a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/thematic-pillars/" target="news"&gt;to the partnership's website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way you shake it, there's something disquieting about the thought of machines making decisions about which human lives are spared and which are lost in a car accident or any other situation. However, with further research like that done by the Institute of Cognitive Science, we can take some comfort in knowing that driverless cars' moral baselines will be a reflection of our own as humans.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In late June, Republicans and Democrats in Congress went to battle during a hearing when Republicans presented a draft package of bills that will establish national standards for testing self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, mere days later in July, House Republicans intend to introduce those same 14 bills to the floor, according to a spokeswoman for the US House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was to introduce the bill package this week and hold formal hearings on the bills next week, Blair Ellis, the spokeswoman, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-selfdriving-idUSKBN19W0YJ" target="new"&gt;told Reuters on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;For House Republicans, the bills are part of an ongoing effort to achieve two primary goals related to the regulation of autonomous vehicle testing. The first is to create national guidelines that transcend state borders, and the second is to reduce the amount of red tape that limits the number of self-driving cars on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines," said Representative Robert Latta, Republican from Ohio, in &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-selfdriving-idUSKBN19I2I2" target="new"&gt;a subcommittee hearing&lt;/a&gt; last month. "This isn't the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government making sure that industry can innovate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the goals of creating national standards and eliminating strict regulations are closely aligned.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In California, for instance, companies such &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=652"target="new"&gt;Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla, &lt;a href="http://www.virtuapedia.com/proddir/dir_product.asp?dir_id=10&amp;p_id=956"target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and Uber have spent a lot of time and money at the national and state level lobbying lawmakers to ensure that they can test their self-driving prototypes on the roads of the Golden State. And while the state has been generally &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/californias-finally-ready-truly-driverless-cars/"target="new"&gt;quite friendly&lt;/a&gt; to the testing of autonomous vehicles, Republicans want to ensure that will always be the case by pre-empting future tightening of state regulations by establishing national standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the bills present a great number of measures. The headliner, though, would give the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the ability to allow annual exemptions from federal safety rules for up to 100,000 vehicles. Part of those safety rules, naturally, require cars to have drivers; exemptions permit for the sale of self-driving cars. Currently, the NHTSA only hands out a maximum of 2,500 exemptions each year, so the proposed increase would allow for an enormous increase in the number of autonomous vehicles on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the aisle, concerns about safety hazards stemming from a lack of regulation have put some Democrats in opposition to the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority," Frank Pallone, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey, said last month. He worried that states would be unable to address pressing, unforeseen safety issues that could arise "without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also included in the bills are measures that ought to be appealing to members across the political spectrum. Several of the bills directly seek to make sure autonomous vehicles will be of particular service to the disabled and the disadvantaged. Bills such as the Disability Mobility Advisory Council Act and the Senior Citizens Advisory Council Act would not in and of themselves create policy, put instead establish their eponymous councils for advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how the bills will fare once they reach the House floor. But if these measures pass, drivers nationwide can prepare to see many more driverless cars traveling alongside them in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Staying connected on the go has never been more beneficial to businesses and their employees. From the fleet driver who requires near real-time updates on the road, to the sales executive who needs access to blueprints while commuting, internet connectivity can be transformative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connected car technology can help mobilize these work tasks, providing employees with the necessary connectivity for work while in transit. For some industries, this has even proven to be essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you're probably thinking -- this all sounds great, but the data bill doesn't. Stay with me, we're just getting to the good part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While data usage concerns once served as a barrier for employees to work on the go; we're breaking down that wall. Staying connected on the road is now easier and more affordable than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point: as of the end of Q1 2017, we had 13 million connected cars on the AT&amp;T network and started offering unlimited data plans for mobile 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspots earlier this year. That means both consumers and businesses can now connect while on the go without being hindered by data usage concerns or cost limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Motors customers can already sign up for unlimited data for their vehicles through certain auto manufacturers at nearly 5,000 AT&amp;T retail stores across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we're rolling out shared unlimited data plans with centralized billing for enterprise customers this summer. That means they will be able to add embedded hotspot connectivity to corporate mobility accounts as easily as adding a smartphone. Mobile workers using connected car solutions will be able to share data more quickly and securely, better attend to customers, boost productivity and maximize efficiencies while on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new connected car plans for business, employees can connect multiple smartphones, tablets and laptops to a single vehicle hotspot without worrying about data overage charges. This could have a huge impact on how businesses operate in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business customers will also receive the benefits of high-speed connectivity with more flexibility by choosing unlimited data plans. Chevrolet is first to offer this plan, followed by other manufacturers later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlimited data on the go will help unlock limitless possibilities. And it's just the beginning.  Connected car technology is revolutionizing the way businesses operate, streamline and scale across multiple industries.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;And we're working to create a safer, more reliable, more enjoyable transportation experience, while improving countless corporate efficiencies every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The interaction with the pizza delivery person is one that has been lampooned in countless movies and TV shows. (The one in &lt;em&gt;There's Something About Mary&lt;/em&gt; is a personal favorite.) But the perennial Hollywood storyline may stop ringing true in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/08/29/dominos-ford-begin-research-pizza-delivery.html" target="new"&gt;Domino's and Ford&lt;/a&gt; recently announced a joint venture, in which some Domino's customers in Ann Arbor, Mich., will soon have their pizzas delivered by autonomous Ford Fusion Hybrid vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As delivery experts, we've been watching the development of self-driving vehicles with great interest as we believe transportation is undergoing fundamental, dramatic change," Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle said in a statement. "We pride ourselves on being technology leaders and are excited to help lead research into how self-driving vehicles may play a role in the future of pizza delivery. This is the first step in an ongoing process of testing that we plan to undertake with Ford."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these delivery cars will be outfitted with self-driving technology, humans will still be along for the ride. Ford safety engineers and other researchers will ride around in the vehicles, driving them and acting as de facto deliverers. They will not, however, actively deliver the pizzas, as customers will need to walk out to the curb to pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;Center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7eL_mCV8QYI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We don't want to wait until we get everything done on the tech and remove the driver," Sherif Marakby, vice president of Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification at Ford, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16213544/dominos-ford-pizza-self-driving-car" target="new"&gt;told the Verge&lt;/a&gt;. "We're trying to start doing the research. We still are working on the technology, because it's not ready to be put on public streets, It's simulating that the vehicle is in autonomous mode."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the delivery cars won't actually drive themselves will not prevent the company from gaining valuable information on how customers will interact with them, according to Domino's USA president Russell Weiner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're interested to learn what people think about this type of delivery," Weiner wrote in a statement. "The majority of our questions are about the last 50 feet of the delivery experience."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Domino's has undergone &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/2/28/16043242/dominos-pizza-tracker-pan-recipe-superfans-db39239ed88e" target="new"&gt;a widely lauded rebrand&lt;/a&gt; that has invigorated its business, especially among millennial customers. Much of it was achieved by the use of technology, including a delivery app that arrived long before those of its competitors and remains the gold standard for food delivery apps. In partnering with Ford's AV division, Domino's is once again embracing a technology that will continue to make the brand appealing to young consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one question still remains: If a pizza is delivered by an autonomous vehicle, do you still have to tip?&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Today we are all familiar with connected car features such as navigation services, media streaming, and remote access features like vehicle tracking. But that's only the tip of the iceberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As connected car technology advances -- and increasingly overlaps with autonomous vehicle technology -- our roads will be safer thanks to vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity. When cars can talk to one another and make their intentions clear, traffic accidents will decrease significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But automobiles are just one of the actors present on roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedestrians and, to an even greater degree, cyclists, present a different type of challenge for car safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volvo already has a &lt;a href="http://autoweek.com/article/technology/how-does-pedestrian-and-cyclist-detection-work-autoweek-explains" target="new"&gt;pedestrian and cyclist detection&lt;/a&gt; system available in its cars, and the European New Car Assessment Program will consider cyclist detection and emergency braking as part of its ratings beginning in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant step occurred in late August, when auto parts giant Bosch introduced an emergency braking and driver assistance system that will provide safety in urban environments that include heavy foot traffic and plenty of cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Driver assistance systems are the next step along the path toward accident-free driving," Bosch board of management member Dr. Dirk Hoheisel wrote &lt;a href="http://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/emergency-braking-in-two-blinks-of-an-eye-121600.html" target="new"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "These electronic assistants are always vigilant and, in emergencies, they respond more quickly than people can. They provide support just where drivers need it -- in busy city traffic."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driver assistance systems can comprise any number of features and services. Rear cameras to assist drivers with backing up are a form of driver assistance system. So are alarms that alert drivers when they're unintentionally drifting out of their lane, and lights installed in side mirrors that let drivers know when a passing vehicle is in their blindspot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 52% of all new cars in Germany have at least one driver assistance system, and that number is growing each year, according to a Bosch survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergency braking represents a particularly advanced form of driver assistance technology, and one that could avert catastrophe and save lives to a greater extent than its predecessors.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bosch cites in its press release, 12% of Germany's road deaths involved cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since cyclists often ride in very close proximity to cars and can act more unpredictably, having an incredibly quick reaction time is important. Bosch's new system can bring a car to a full stop from 25 miles per hour in 190 milliseconds, which is less time than it takes to blink twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"An emergency braking assistant may reduce braking distance by the few crucial centimeters that can mean the difference between life and death," says president of Bosch's Chassis Systems Control division Gerhard Steiger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can expect to see this technology quickly become more commonplace as it is distributed by Bosch and mimicked by other OEMs and parts suppliers. With the number of lives it figures to save, it's just common sense.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The most valuable asset for connected car manufacturers -- as well as the providers of the technology that goes into them -- is the vast amount of data that the vehicles generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OEMs can learn invaluable information about their customers' driving habits, informing how they design, market, sell and service their vehicles. Data from connected services like navigation or music streaming can also be leveraged in a variety of ways to help improve the consumer experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry, however, should not take it for granted that this data will be handed over on a silver platter. The recording, transmitting, analyzing and storage of this huge amount of data requires an infrastructure that is both vast and complex. For the foreseeable future, it's not something that any single company will be able to effectively handle on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an issue that companies have started addressing through collaborations, specifically by pooling resources to ensure that all of them will be able to offer adequate data-based services to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was recently announced that Denso, Ericsson, Intel, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), NTT Docomo, Toyota InfoTechnology Center and Toyota have formed a group named the Automotive Edge Computing Consortium. Their goal is to develop a shared ecosystem to support connected car services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The consortium will focus on increasing network capacity to accommodate automotive big data in a reasonable fashion between vehicles and the cloud by means of edge computing and more efficient network design," the companies wrote in a joint &lt;a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/news/2017/8/consortium-for-automotive-big-data" target="new"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. "It will define requirements and develop use cases for emerging mobile devices with a particular focus on the automotive industry, bringing them to standards bodies, industry consortiums and solution providers. The consortium will also encourage the development of best practices for the distributed and layered computing approach recommended by the members."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The establishment of the consortium isn't the only partnership Ericsson has forged recently. The company also teamed up with &lt;a href="https://www.zenuity.com/" target="new"&gt;Zenuity&lt;/a&gt;, a joint venture between &lt;a href="http://www.volvo.com/home.html" target="new"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.autoliv.com//" target="new"&gt;Autoliv&lt;/a&gt; that was formed this year to develop driver-assistance and self-driving systems. With Zenuity, Ericsson will build an end-to-end platform incorporating everything from IoT connectivity to autonomous functions called Zenuity Connected Cloud-Powered by Ericsson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With a strong focus on increasing safety through [Advanced Driver Assistance Support] and [Autonomous Driving] software and functions, our unique expertise in ADAS and autonomous technologies combined with Ericsson's technology leadership in complex connectivity solutions is a win-win for the entire automotive industry," &lt;a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2017/9/ericsson-and-zenuity-team-up-for-self-driving-cars" target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; Zenuity CEO Dennis Nobelius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the announcement of the Automotive Edge Computing Consortium states, the foundation of the consortium is the belief that data usage and data generation by vehicles is about to explode. Some estimates show that the data volume between cars and the cloud will grow a stunning 10,000 times in the next eight years, reaching 10 exabytes a month by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those counting, an exabyte equals 1 billion gigabytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the infrastructure that exists for vehicle-cloud interaction is nowhere near where it would need to be to support that amount of data. By teaming up, these companies are acknowledging that building a new infrastructure is something that none of them can do on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's also something that even this consortium of companies won't be able to do by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In the coming months, the aforementioned companies will initiate activities to invite relevant global technology leaders and expand the consortium," reads the press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect more partners to come onboard soon, as companies will want their voices heard and needs met as the data infrastructure of tomorrow is planned and built.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Last July, Elon Musk published a blog post on the Tesla website under the title "Master Plan, Part Deux." As its name indicates, the post is a sequel to the original Master Plan, written in 2006, which detailed how Tesla hoped to introduce a game-changing car and deliberately work to make it affordable and widely available over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the $35,000 Model 3 is being delivered to customers, it's impressive to look back and see how on-track Tesla has been with its original gameplan. It also lends credence to "Part Deux,"  which discussed Tesla's plans for developing electric trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In addition to consumer vehicles, there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport," &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux" target="new"&gt;Musk wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "Both are in the early stages of development at Tesla and should be ready for unveiling next year. We believe the Tesla Semi will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Musk has gone even further to stake Tesla's claim to the future of fleet trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September," he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/852580027178696704" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; this past April. "Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/852580027178696704"&gt;April 13, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the old business adage urges that one ought to "underpromise and overdeliver," it's more of Musk's style to overpromise and then, somehow, clear the high bar that he sets for himself and his company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With it now being September, Tesla has made no official announcement on when exactly -- or even if -- we'll indeed get a look at the prototype of the truck this month. Research analysts, however, see it as likely that the product will indeed be unveiled in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We expect Tesla's Electric Trucks to come soon, with SOP [start of production] in late 2018 based on plans to utilize slightly less vertical integration (Tesla does not see any reason to make their own Cabs or Gliders), and common sourcing with Tesla's light vehicles (uniquely possible for EVs)," analyst &lt;a href="http://www.barrons.com/articles/will-tesla-own-the-truck-market-too-1504620368" target="new"&gt;Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a report on Tesla's fleet trucks published early this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-the-biggest-catalyst-in-trucking-in-decades-1504708550" target="new"&gt;At Morgan Stanley&lt;/a&gt;, analysts Ravi Shanker and Adam Jonas dove in even deeper to explain how the production of self-driving trucks may work for Tesla. Based on a detailed series of assumptions about the company's manufacturing capabilities, Shanker and Jonas estimate that Class 8 electric trucks represent a net value "of $5.1bn or roughly 8% of Tesla's current market cap."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysts also assert that the new product offering could ignite further interest in the company's stock. The analysts proposed the &lt;a href="http://nacvshow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National American Vehicle Show&lt;/a&gt;, taking place in Atlanta on September 25, as a possible date at which the truck could be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was revealed last month, Tesla has been in communications with the Nevada DMV about a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735613" target="new"&gt;permit to test long-haul trucks&lt;/a&gt; on the state's public roads. So not only will automobile enthusiasts hopefully see the Tesla trucks in a showroom later this month, but residents of the Copper State could very well see them on their roads in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For those hoping their next vehicle purchase would be an Apple iCar, their dreams were deflated in August by a New York Times report that Apple had scaled back its goals for Project Titan, the code name for the company's self-driving car project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These days, Apple's automotive ambitions are more modest," &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=735700" target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Daisuke Wakabayashi. "The company has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is instead working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself... The project's reduced scale aligns Apple more closely with other tech companies that are working on autonomous driving technology but are steering clear of building cars."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Apple enthusiasts took that to mean that Apple had given up its autonomous vehicle ambitions altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, the company said it was still working on vehicular autonomy and exploring artificial intelligence, but was it really developing AV tech in earnest after things went awry in attempts at a ground-up Apple self-driving car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, apparently, is yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That news comes via the Twitter feed of MaCallister Higgins, who knows a thing or two about self-driving cars as co-founder of the self-driving taxi startup &lt;a href="https://voyage.auto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="new"&gt;Voyage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Going to need more than 140 characters to go over [Apple's] Project Titan," Higgins &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/macjshiggins/status/920326969522241536" target="new"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on October 17. "I call it 'The Thing.' " Accompanying the tweet is a ten-second video that pans the length of a Lexus RX 450h SUV, the vehicle that the California DMV granted Apple a test permit for in April of this year. Higgins's video shows a sensor suite atop the car that, compared to other rooftop sensor systems on self-driving cars, is quite oversized, hence "The Thing" nickname. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Going to need more than 140 characters to go over &amp;#127822;&amp;#39;s Project Titan.

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Verge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16496182/apple-self-driving-car-project-titan-sensor-lidar" target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that "the car appears to be outfitted with... six &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt;-made Lidar sensors, several radar units, and a number of cameras." In a subsequent tweet, though, Higgins says there were six &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; Lidar units in the front of the vehicle, making a total of 12. He speculated that the Lidar sensors do not have full 360-degree coverage in order to prevent them from interfering with one another. He also guessed that most of the vehicle's computing hardware was located on the roof, whereas most self-driving cars house these devices in the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In replying to Higgins, multiple users joined in with barbs about the amount of hardware on the car's roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm pretty sure that's more sensor synthesis than it takes to land on Europa and burrow into the sea," &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/920520452216381441" target="new"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; @SeamusBlackley. Another user had cost concerns. "That's what, $96,000 in Lidar? (assuming 12 Velodyne pucks at $8k ea.)," &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexqgb/status/920770701669253120" target="new"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; @alexqgb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, an Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. At least we know one thing hasn't changed from the early days of Project Titan: It still remains very top secret.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Every company in Silicon Valley likes to boast about how it's "disrupting" an industry, but few companies can claim the disruptive title quite like Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally founded in 2008 as AirBed &amp; Breakfast, the Bay Area startup introduced an online platform for travelers to find accommodations with locals. The product quickly gained momentum, offering tourists cost-effective and unique lodging opportunities, and empowering hosts to bring in a not insubstantial amount of income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disruption to the travel industry has been enormous: The hotel industry continues to lobby municipalities for tighter restrictions on Airbnb hosting, and some hotel chains have completely revamped their customer offerings in an attempt to win back travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another company that can legitimately say it has been disruptive is &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside Uber, the ridesharing company has revolutionized the way that people get around, especially in urban environments. With a large portion of its operations now fixated on the self-driving car industry, Lyft clearly has big plans to further alter the transportation industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's not surprising that when Lyft was looking for a new vice president of design it turned to a veteran of another disruptive company, Katie Dill, whose previous job was director of experience at Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The similarities are that Lyft is working at building a service that goes into the online and the offline worlds, it develops a community, and it's helping to leverage hospitality to make an experience great," Dill told &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/23/lyft-hires-katie-dill-as-vp-of-design/" target="new"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "It's growing rapidly, too -- earlier this year, only half the U.S. had access to Lyft and now it's 95%. That kind of rapid growth certainly has lots of potential, but also has lots of challenges."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent months have been kind to Lyft, and not just because rival Uber has languished among scandals and lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, the company &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/technology/lyft-waymo-self-driving-cars.html?_r=0" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a partnership with AV power &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; to launch autonomous vehicle pilot projects. In September, Lyft unveiled a similar partnership &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736849" target="new"&gt;with Ford&lt;/a&gt; that will see the automaker use its fleet of self-driving cars to give AV rides to Lyft customers once Ford feels its AVs are ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest news of Lyft's already momentous 2017 came earlier in October, when it &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2017/10/20/lyft-google-billion-dollar-investment-round/" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a $1 billion funding round led by CapitalG, the venture capital division of Waymo (and Google) parent company Alphabet. Beyond the obvious benefits of the influx of capital, the tightened alliance with Alphabet figures to be an incredibly valuable asset as the company ramps up its operations in the AV space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For her part, Dill believes that Lyft's work on self-driving cars is a natural extension of the values that brought her to the company: hospitality in transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"[Lyft co-founder and president] John Zimmer's background in hospitality is one of the things that inspired me most about Lyft in chatting with the team," Dill told TechCrunch. "Seeing how the company has brought that into everything they've done has been really inspiring. It's more than just a ride, it's more than transportation -- they really are building a community and ensuring that experiences are great through that lens and that absolutely will hold true with autonomous as well."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;We're not lacking for information on consumer attitudes towards autonomous vehicles. Plenty of surveys, studies and reports have been conducted to determine whether the public is ready for an autonomous future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the results are mixed and tend to follow predictable patterns. Younger people are more trusting of AV technology, for example. But each study is valuable in its own way. As more specific information becomes available on prospective users' attitudes, the better companies are equipped to develop autonomous vehicles that make users feel comfortable and enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edmunds.com/" target="new"&gt;Edmunds&lt;/a&gt; recently released a particularly &lt;a href="https://static.ed.edmunds-media.com/unversioned/img/industry-center/analysis/autonomous-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;useful survey&lt;/a&gt;, entitled "Transportation Transformation: The Current State of the Autonomous Car." The scope of the report is a bit more focused than its title suggests, in a good way. While the survey takes stock of general consumer attitudes towards self-driving cars, it dives deeper by gauging customer interest in active safety features and analyzing which automakers are leading in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While there are a number of ways one can define who's 'leading' in the race to autonomy, analyzing the prevalence of active safety features demonstrates just how ready OEMs are to bring this technology to mass production, and how willing consumers are to adopt it," Edmunds executive director of industry analysis Jessica Caldwell wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/car-buyers-are-ready-to-embrace-autonomous-vehicles-new-edmunds-report-reveals-300541160.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "While some car buyers may view a fully autonomous vehicle as a novelty, a vehicle that has the ability to prevent an accident before it occurs is seen as a safety breakthrough."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey, which is based on answers from 1,500 consumers, found that 65% of millennials would "feel safe" in a self-driving car that required a human in the driver's seat, ready to take over at any time. This number dwindles as the age of respondents increases, going down to 28% for those over 65.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since millennials are the car buyers (or ride hailers or ride sharers) of tomorrow, these numbers are encouraging. However, since older people, who may not be as mobile, have a lot to gain from autonomous vehicles it is unfortunate that they do not feel equally safe with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for active safety features, respondents seemed willing to pay for the premium feature. Forty percent of those surveyed said they would spend between $1,000 and $2,000 extra for a car with these types of systems. The features that were most attractive were blind-spot detection (61%) and pre-collision braking systems (52%). Drivers were less excited about adaptive cruise control (34%) and automatic parking (33%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a methodology that rewarded automakers for putting active safety systems as standard features in a high percentage of its models, Edmunds also rated automakers on their AV safety feature offerings. With a score of 57, Tesla came out on top. Rounding out the top five were Volvo (47), Honda (37), Mercedes-Benz (36) and Mazda (34). Luxury automakers generally fared better in the rankings, as price points were not taken into account, which makes appearances by Honda and Mazda at the top of the list all the more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active safety features are becoming more and more common in new vehicles, but there's still an enormous number of drivers that have never used them. As more people are exposed to these features and see their value on the road, interest in them is expected to rise.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In October, the founder of self-driving taxi company Voyage stumbled upon a prototype of an autonomous vehicle made by Apple testing in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MacCallister Higgins &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/macjshiggins/status/920326969522241536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="new"&gt;tweeted a video&lt;/a&gt; of his discovery, jokingly referring to the Apple car as "The Thing" because of the hefty set of hardware stacked atop the car. The vehicle appeared to have six &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt; Lidar sensors on the roof and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/macjshiggins/status/920455193778470913" target="new"&gt;six more&lt;/a&gt; in the front of the car. As one user noted, those sensors cost $8,000 a piece for OEMs, meaning the Apple vehicle had $96,000 worth of Lidar alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That kind of cost is not, to put it mildly, scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the autonomous vehicle community, this is a common refrain. In their current iteration, Lidar sensors are &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734982" target="new"&gt;widely considered&lt;/a&gt; to be too expensive to make manufacturing self-driving cars viable in big numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since any point of friction also represents an opportunity for innovation, a number of companies have thrown their hat into the ring and are trying to develop cheaper Lidar sensors that don't sacrifice safety for cost. At the Tokyo Motor Show in October, &lt;a href="http://global.pioneer/en/" target="new"&gt;Pioneer Corp.&lt;/a&gt; became the latest to do so when it unveiled plans to begin producing a vehicular Lidar system at a price point under $100 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pioneer hopes that its use of micromirrors will distinguish its Lidar sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The 3D Lidar... can be put into practical in-car use in combination with the MEMS mirror, characterized by a small aperture with a lens, and by optimizing the optical design," the company wrote in a &lt;a href="http://global.pioneer/en/news/press/2017/pdf/0907-1.pdf" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Ultimately, Pioneer aims to install 3D Lidar sensors in vehicles with Level 3 or higher autonomous driving technology on general roads, and applied in next-generation GIS service."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Tokyo Motor Show, a series Pioneer demonstrations showed just how the technology works. Alongside an operating Lidar system, Pioneer placed a monitor that showed a data map of what the sensor was detecting. Viewers were able to visualize what a self-driving "sees" based on the data provided by Lidar. A "Concept Cockpit" was also erected to simulate a Level 3 AV riding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Pioneer could be seen as a late entrant to the Lidar market, Senior Executive Officer Satoshi Ohdate believes that there is still an opportunity for a dominant market leader to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The car makers haven't yet settled on specific partners when it comes to Lidar," Ohdate told &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/pioneer-leaps-into-driverless-car-fray-with-microscopic-mirrors" target="new"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. "There is plenty of opportunity if you are offering something good at low cost."&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A self-driving car is truly greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing holistic vehicle awareness isn't the responsibility of any single component. It comes from having a suite of sensors that include Lidar, radar, and cameras all working in concert to help a car understand its surroundings. But a diverse group of sensors isn't enough: Self-driving cars need even more tools to build awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief among those is three-dimensional, high-definition mapping. Having a digital map for reference gives an autonomous vehicle's operating system an idea of what's ahead, baseline knowledge that substantially eases the burden on a vehicle's sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-driving car world got another reminder of just how essential digital mapping is in late October, when tech giant and prominent AV developer &lt;a href="http://apollo.auto/" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; struck up a partnership with fellow Chinese company Shouqi Limousine and Chauffeur to speed its development of maps for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership with the ride-hailing company is part of Baidu's effort to get self-driving cars on the road as soon as possible, according to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/29/baidu-partners-with-ride-hailing-service-on-self-driving-cars/" target="new"&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's no secret as to why Baidu is signing a deal like this: it's making a big bet on self-driving technology, and it doesn't have much time to fulfill some of its promises," Engadget's Jon Fingas writes. "A transportation firm like Shouqi is effectively a shortcut: it already has the kind of real-world map data that would take Baidu months or years to collect."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's urgency is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu hasn't been shy about its ambitious goals for self-driving cars. Earlier in October, CEO Robin Li told the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/baidu-sees-ai-as-key-to-its-future-1508811541" target="new"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; that Baidu had plans to partner with another Chinese company to pilot a fully self-driving bus beginning in 2018. Also in October, Baidu announced a partnership with Chinese automaker BAIC group to manufacture autonomous vehicles by 2021. Li is quick to point out that Baidu isn't building these cars on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We only touch the software part," Li said. "We don't manufacture the cars ... We provide the technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent aspect of that technology is Apollo, Baidu's open autonomous platform that currently has over 70 partners, including high-profile autonomous players like Intel, Nvidia, Velodyne and Ford. In September, Baidu announced the latest iteration of the platform: Apollo 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The cloud simulation system on Apollo is the only platform that provides open, built-in HD maps tailored for autonomous driving," the company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736835" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of the update. "Based on large-scale cloud computing capacity, Apollo has a vast amount of real traffic data in China, and has a virtual running capacity of one million kilometers per day."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu hopes that data, combined with Shouqui's maps, will help the company deploy many different forms of autonomous vehicles in the near future and become Asia's AV leader. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The sharing economy has completely rewired the way people think about various aspects of our lives. Take Airbnb and its effects on travel, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, the idea of staying in a stranger's apartment on a trip to Los Angeles, Paris or Shanghai would seem even more foreign than the locale. Hotels were the only game in town. Today, many travelers don't even bother to look at hotel rates before checking out Airbnb listings. Not only are they likely to find better rates, they can also find spaces that are more tailored to their preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the transaction, homeowners have become comfortable allowing strangers into their places, and the money from Airbnb rentals has become an important secondary source of income, or even a primary one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its prominence, Airbnb is just one example of the sharing economy. The business model has been adapted for owners of just about everything, even cars. &lt;a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/" target="new"&gt;SnappCar&lt;/a&gt; is a Dutch company that takes ride-sharing to another level, by allowing car owners to rent their cars to SnappCar users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can imagine the anxiety that goes along with handing over the keys to your car to a stranger. At least an Airbnb apartment stays in one place. To assuage car owners' concerns, SnappCar has announced a partnership with telecom company &lt;a href="https://www.teliacompany.com/en" target="new"&gt;Telia&lt;/a&gt; to offer SnappCar owners a telematics service called Telia Sense, giving them the ability to track their car's activity, including its location, when it is being used through the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Telia Sense is a perfect fit for us because our customers can keep an eye on their car when it's rented out," SnappCar Sweden head Fredrik Karlberg wrote in a &lt;a href="https://iotbusinessnews.com/2017/12/15/20878-telia-partners-peer-peer-car-sharing-company-snapcar/" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "They can see where it is and how it's being driven, if something unexpected happens or if there is anything wrong. It will be a more secure and better experience for both the owner and the renter."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main appeal of Telia Sense is its location services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a renter says he's going across town to do some errands, and three hours later you see him two states away, you'll immediately have good reason to call the authorities. Better yet, would-be thieves are far less likely to steal a SnappCar knowing that they can be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Karlberg notes, Telia Sense goes beyond location services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car owners will also be able to access data such as how fast their cars were driven. With Airbnb, homeowners can use things like a Nest cam to monitor their place while they're away. Telia Sense provides SnappCar owners with a similar same ability to see monitor their cars and make sure they are handled respectfully. The owners also have the ability to leave feedback on renters so future owners can know whether or not the renters can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are legitimate reasons to want privacy for a drive in a rented car, including privacy for its own sake. But for a service like SnappCar, where a serious level of trust is required between strangers, location services are a necessary and appropriate precaution.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn means many things to many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, it calls to mind a "fuhgettaboutit" wise guy attitude. For others, it's the birthplace of hipsterdom, complete with handlebar mustaches and mixologist-made cocktails. But the most populated borough in New York City is also gaining a new reputation. While Brooklyn will never be confused with Silicon Valley, or even its Manhattan counterpart, Silicon Alley, the borough is quickly becoming home to a slew of cutting-edge tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such company is &lt;a href="https://www.carmera.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="new"&gt;Carmera&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 2015 by Ro Gupta, formerly the head of development for Disqus, and Justin Day, former CTO of another Brooklyn startup Makerbot, Carmera focuses primarily on the development of real-time, three-dimensional street maps for autonomous vehicle navigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has been growing at a healthy clip, so much so that it is now expanding beyond its Brooklyn roots. In December, the company's leadership announced that it was opening a Seattle office to host five of its 15 employees, including one third of its executive team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-vehicles-enacted-legislation.aspx" target="new"&gt;21 states&lt;/a&gt; have passed legislation regarding driverless cars, Washington is one of six that -- instead of legislation -- has a standing executive order that permits the testing of self-driving cars within its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other states with similar executive orders include Massachusetts and Arizona, both of which are considered among the friendliest states in the country for AV development.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 20 companies based in Washington develop technology that is connected to self-driving cars in some form, including interactive machine learning company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734533" target="new"&gt;Mighty AI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its friendliness towards driverless cars, Seattle is an ideal place for a digital mapping company to set up shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Other than the Bay Area, no city in the U.S. has as many top-notch software engineers with a background in maps due to the presence of Microsoft (first MapPoint, then Bing Maps), Google (Maps teams located in their Fremont office), Amazon (for the Fire Phone and Logistics), Tableau, Inrix and many startups/smaller companies in the mapping space (such as Glympse)," Carmera chief product officer Ethan Sorrelgreen wrote in an email to &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/raising-cash-3d-map-maker-autonomous-vehicles-carmera-opens-seattle-office/" target="new"&gt;GeekWire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carmera will work out of &lt;a href="https://comotion.uw.edu/what-we-do/comotion-labs/home/" target="new"&gt;CoMotion Labs&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Washington, a startup incubator for young companies working in engineering, IT, clean tech and augmented reality. Between 60 and 90 startups are working out of the Labs at any given time, providing constant and invaluable networking opportunities for the Carmera employees that will be stationed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carmera refers to its 3D maps as "professionally crowdsourced," referring to a trusted network of sensors that help build virtual street maps and live feeds of construction, accidents or other real-time events that might affect an autonomous system's decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p"Automotive OEMs, mobility platforms, logistics companies and researchers can benefit from four core building blocks of machine-readable, sensor-agnostic data to validate vehicle localization and improve routing decisions, based on real road conditions," according to the company's website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Seattle expansion comes on the heels of a $6.4 million round of funding &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/06/05/carmera-maps-funding/" target="new"&gt;raised in June&lt;/a&gt; with partners including Matrix Partners, Resolute Ventures, Notation Capital and NFL Hall-of-Famer &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-montana" target="new"&gt;Joe Montana&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;If you can wade through the dense language that makes legalese read like a Dr. Seuss book, perusing patent applications can be an informative way to learn where technology is headed.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the future-looking self-driving car, patent applications range from &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735605" target="new"&gt;removable steering wheels&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738493" target="new"&gt;driverless off-road trucks&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738572" target="new"&gt;anti-motion sickness technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the product or technology described in the patent never comes to fruition, it can still provide valuable insight about the patent applicant's future goals. And if that applicant happens to be one of the world's most important tech companies, that insight becomes quite valuable indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's no surprise that a recent patent application from &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; generated a fair amount of attention. In late December, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/21/apple-patents-navigation-system-for-self-driving-cars.html" target="new"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt; that the US Patent and Trademark Office had published an Apple patent application entitled "Autonomous Navigation System." The patent, which had been in the works since at least 2015, describes an autonomous system that would learn to navigate a given road autonomously by first being guided through it by a human driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The vehicle includes sensor devices which monitor characteristics of the driving route based on the vehicle being navigated along the driving route," reads the &lt;a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?Docid=20170363430" target="new"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt;. "And an autonomous navigation system which is interoperable with the sensor devices to: implement a succession of updates to a virtual characterization of the driving route, based on monitoring a succession of manual navigations of the vehicle along the driving route, associate a confidence indicator with the virtual characterization... and enable autonomous navigation of the vehicle along the driving route."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a "virtual characterization of [a] driving route," may sound an awful lot like the digital maps that many consider to be a fundamental component of a successful autonomous vehicle, the patent positions its technology as something of a correction to digital mapping in its current form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The development of such a map can require extensive expenditures of time and effort," the patent reads. "In addition... such a map can unexpectedly become obsolete and unusable for safe autonomous navigation of a route."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are certainly valid criticisms of the limits of digital mapping for autonomous vehicles. But those holes in the capabilities of mapping are exactly why very few AV developers have chosen to build their vehicles to rely solely on mapping; most are equipped with mapping capabilities and a suite of physical sensors, each of which covers up the deficiencies of the other. And given that its "virtual characterizations" would be built off of previous trips through given stretches of road, it's unclear how such a system would be any less vulnerable to sudden obsolescence than a conventional digital map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the patent application signals that Apple is still very much in the autonomous vehicle game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735700" target="new"&gt;scaled back&lt;/a&gt; plans for Project Titan, an effort to develop a self-driving car from the ground up, news continues to emerge out of Cupertino about new AV developments. It is becoming increasingly unlikely that the self-driving revolution won't involve Apple in some form.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;What is the worst confluence of driving conditions you can possibly imagine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's probably nighttime in a densely populated city. There would be a vision-obscuring blizzard making the roads slick and unreliable. Traffic would be thick and moving irregularly. Worse, the drivers around you would have seemingly little regard for your safety, or even their own. Even the road signs would be difficult to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to life for drivers in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poorly laid out roads, bad weather and not-so-cautious driving practices make for dangerous automobile treks in the Russian capital. Moscow streets are home to 20 serious car accidents per day, and the road fatality rate in Russia is double that of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, that makes it a difficult landscape for autonomous vehicles to navigate. But the conditions in Russia are not all that different from other countries in the world, which is why autonomous developers believe that, with apologies to New York, "if they can make it there, they can make it anywhere."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent story in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/02/moscow-russia-self-driving-car-challenge-hackathon" target="new"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; by Annie Gaus documented an event spawned by this belief. At a three-day hackathon in Moscow, engineering students from around the globe and corporate sponsors like &lt;a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html" target="new"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; gathered to take a crack at developing autonomous systems for Moscow's roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The event had another purpose: to advance a credo that when it comes to autonomous cars, tougher conditions produce smarter technology," writes Gaus. "Lidar -- the expensive, light-pulsing sensors relied upon by current autonomous car models -- is worthless in snow ... Instead, cars should be trained to operate using high-definition cameras, low-cost radars and powerful AI that mimics the human brain."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that Lidar is "worthless in snow," advanced by Olga Uskova of Russian AV software developer Cognitive Technologies may be an extreme position -- nearly all driverless car manufacturers incorporate Lidar sensors in some form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Lidar does not work as effectively in the snow, and developers have relied more heavily on other hardware to navigate in adverse conditions. An &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739278&amp;amp;" target="new"&gt;autonomous vehicle in Finland&lt;/a&gt; primarily used radar sensors to complete a journey through a wintry mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the hackathon engineers in Moscow, cobbling together an autonomous driving system over the course of three sleepless days proved difficult. The top team only managed to achieve 40% accuracy in identifying road signs. The expected culprits were to blame for the difficulties: Snow-covered road signs were difficult for systems to detect, and non-Russian speakers had an even more challenging time differentiating between similar looking road signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While success proved elusive at the hackathon, in some ways, that was beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that driverless car developers are moving beyond building cars that can work in the idealistic sunny climates of Arizona and California and shifting to the more challenging task of creating vehicles that can work in more realistic scenarios is an important sign of progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many expect that self-driving cars will eventually operate 24/7, but they will only be able to do that if they can handle the weather and unique road conditions that present themselves at every moment of the day all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Tragically, many serious auto accidents were only milliseconds away from being prevented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piloting a multi-ton automobile is a game of inches, especially at high speeds. The difference between a major collision and a close call can be the amount of time between when a driver thinks about hitting the brakes or turning the wheel, and the time it takes him or her to actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridging such a minuscule physiological gap is a daunting challenge. But the so-called "Brain-to-Vehicle" (B2V) technology, which &lt;a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated for the first time at CES 2018 in Las Vegas, attempts to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product involves brain-wave reading skullcaps, which drivers wear behind the wheel. Paired with intelligent predictive software, Nissan's B2V tech can anticipate a driver's next move, whether it be acceleration, braking or turning. The vehicle can then begin that action before the driver even hits a pedal or turns the steering wheel. Nissan claims the tech makes a difference of 0.2 to 0.5 seconds in performing a given action, "while remaining largely imperceptible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The B2V moniker is a reference to connected car technologies like vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity. V2V connectivity allows cars to "talk" to one another on the road, telegraphing their intentions to create more predictable -- and therefore safer -- traffic patterns. V2I connectivity refers to communication between cars and a central grid to optimize on-road operations like the patterns of traffic lights. Many believe that V2X (vehicle-to-everything) connectivity will be essential to the functioning of fully self-driving cars, and Nissan claims its B2V tech will factor into that equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When most people think about autonomous driving, they have a very impersonal vision of the future, where humans relinquish control to the machines. Yet B2V technology does the opposite, by using signals from their own brain to make the drive even more exciting and enjoyable," Nissan Executive Vice President Daniele Schillaci said in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-3459ed449767a2e07b2e465ced0014bc-180103-01-e" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Through Nissan Intelligent Mobility, we are moving people to a better world by delivering more autonomy, more electrification and more connectivity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nissan Intelligent Mobility program, of which B2V is a part of, is an initiative through which Nissan strives to embrace and integrate the most futuristic automotive technology into its vehicles. Other technologies that have come out of Nissan Intelligent Mobility include ProPilot Park, an advanced automated parking system, and e-Pedal, which integrates both acceleration and braking into a single pedal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are both limits and theoretical concerns about Nissan's B2V product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One involves finding a home for the hardware powering the advanced technology inside the vehicle. There are also issues involved with convincing drivers to actually don a wired skullcap every time they get behind the wheel. Then there's the concern about what would happen if the technology faltered and ended up causing an accident instead of preventing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as unusual as brain wave-reading hats might appear, the concept of a vehicle using biometric data to anticipate a driver's actions has enormous potential. If a vehicle can augment human capacities to allow them to perform better than they would on their own, that is certainly a technology worth exploring further.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Embark Technology, a startup developing self-driving trucks, announced it had completed a coast-to-coast, 2,400-mile journey from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Fla., test drive with a semi-autonomous truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is in a three-way partnership with the truck-leasing company Ryder and the appliance giant Electrolux, known best for its line of Frigidaire appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embark has taken an existing truck and equipped it with a series of sensors and software, to navigate stretches of highway, but would still require human drivers to enter and exit highways and drive on city streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cross-country trek, first &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/embarks-self-driving-truck-drove-2400-miles-across-the-u-s/"target="new"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by TechCrunch, took five days, which the company said it thinks it could get down to two days.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;During the entirety of the test a human driver was seated behind the wheel at all times to take control of the truck if necessary, though company CEO Alex Rodrigues told TechCrunch the truck was drive autonomously for "the vast majority" of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embark started delivering refrigerators along a 650-mile stretch of Interstate 10 from El Paso, Texas, to Ontario, Calif., in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those trucks were driven with Level 2 automation, a federal standard that denotes the ability of the vehicle to steer itself as well as accelerate and brake under normal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A driver is required to pay attention to the road at all times and take control if the system is unable to navigate a hazard, and the driver is in the driver's seat at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are trying to get self-driving technology out on the road as fast as possible," Rodrigues &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/self-driving-trucks.html" target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The New York Times in November. "Trucking needs self-driving and self-driving needs trucking."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a promotional video on the company's &lt;a href="http://embarktrucks.com/"target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, Rodrigues said Embark is planning on additional testing on new freight routes in the near future as it continues to test out the system and prepare for a market launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a January &lt;a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/13-industries-disrupted-driverless-cars/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from CB Insights, driverless automobiles will reduce demand for truckers, taxi drivers and other driving professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, telematics technology -- the use of telecommunications to facilitate communication and gather data from vehicles -- will allow taxi and trucking companies to manage their self-driving fleets so that they provide services and run their routes with optimal efficiency, but humans will still be needed to manage these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driverless trucks are being used to &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-18/rio-tinto-opens-worlds-first-automated-mine/6863814" target="new"&gt;move iron ore at mines in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and the Canadian energy company Suncor Energy is &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/autonomous-trucks-could-transform-labour-market-eliminate-driver-jobs/article25715184/" target="new"&gt;working to automate its own trucks&lt;/a&gt; in a process its CFO estimates will take 800 human drivers off its drilling site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Fuller, executive chairman of US Xpress, the fourth-largest trucking company in the US, told &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/"target="new"&gt;Trucks.com&lt;/a&gt; in July 2017 that he believes long-haul trucks will have Level 4 autonomous capability in three to four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to enhance the safety, give [drivers] the ability to be more productive, try to create a better return for the company and supply a better service for our customers," he said. "Our number one goal is to create jobs that people want and that's the reason we need products that make the job a lot simpler for drivers."&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Uber repeatedly tried to partner with Google for years before the companies ended up as fierce rivals for the future of autonomous cars, Uber founder Travis Kalanick told a jury in San Francisco on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as 2013, Uber talked to Google about pairing its ride-hailing prowess with the larger company's self-driving car technology, Kalanick said. But over time, it proved hard to get the attention of his contact, Google co-founder Larry Page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tension grew as the two companies' car projects started to overlap. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"It was kind of like a little brother with a big brother," Kalanick said of the companies' relationship. He testified Wednesday morning on the third day of a trade-secrets trial between Uber and Waymo -- the company that grew out of Google's self-driving car effort. Waymo has accused Uber of stealing eight key pieces of its intellectual property by acquiring a startup founded by former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski. The self-driving car company, a division of Google parent Alphabet, is seeking $1.8 billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTEDYCkNqns" target="new"&gt;sometimes hot-headed&lt;/a&gt; Kalanick seemed calm and mostly at ease as he answered questions on the stand for nearly two hours on February 7, his second and last day of testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late in the summer of 2013, Google invited Uber to work with its autonomous car project, Kalanick said. Google picked him up in one of its early self-driving cars. "I'm like 'That's pretty cool,'" Kalanick recalled. But Google wasn't willing to give as much time to the partnership as Uber wanted, he said. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;So starting in early 2015, Uber began to hire dozens of engineers from the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh to launch its own self-driving project. That got Google's attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Larry was very upset with us about us acquiring the CMU team and starting the autonomy effort ourselves," Kalanick said. "He was a little angry and said, 'Why are you doing my thing?'" Put another way, "Generally, Google was super unhappy, unpumped, about us doing this," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those hirings gave Uber an advantage over Google that only grew after Uber attracted Levandowski and other Google employees, Uber's lawyers have argued. They say Waymo is suing because it can't keep up. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Kalanick had a phone call with Page in October 2016, after Uber acquired of Levandowski's startup, called Otto. He said Page complained, "You're taking our people. You're taking our IP." Kalanick said he told Page that Uber had a process to make sure it wasn't stealing Google's intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under questioning from an attorney for Uber, Karen Dunn of the firm Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, Kalanick said Uber hired Levandowski in 2016 for his brains, not trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We hired Anthony because we felt that he was incredibly visionary, a very good technologist, and he was also very charming," Kalanick said. For one thing, Levandowski had a vision of what autonomous ride-hailing fleets could mean for cities of the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalanick also testified that Lidar, the laser-based vision system used in both Google's and Uber's vehicles, was only part of what Uber was seeking when it acquired Otto for $592 million. Waymo has said its former employee took its secret Lidar designs to Uber, which then duplicated them. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Under questioning by Waymo's attorney, Charles Verhoeven of Quinn Emmanuel, Kalanick admitted that he went ahead with the Otto acquisition knowing Waymo might sue alleging intellectual-property theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Levandowski's request, Uber eventually agreed to indemnify him against such a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;He also admitted that he never read a due-diligence report that Uber ordered from a forensics firm to ensure it didn't receive any trade secrets through the acquisition. Kalanick said he signs hundreds of documents every day and doesn't have time to read everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pP
Kalanick's testimony on Wednesday shed light on Silicon Valley's rough-and-tumble culture through the eyes of one of its most legendary -- or notorious -- executives. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Waymo's Verhoeven questioned Kalanick over many texts he exchanged with Levandowski in the months leading up to the Otto acquisition. One text from Levandowski simply said, "Burn the village." Another Uber executive's notes from a meeting showed Kalanick saying, "The golden time is over. It is war time." Asked about this quote, he told Verhoeven, "It sounds like something I would say." &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Another text that Levandowski sent as Uber considered acquiring his company said, "Here's the speech you need to give," followed by a "wink" emoji and a YouTube link to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVxYOQS6ggk" target="new"&gt;"greed is good"&lt;/a&gt; monologue from the 1987 film &lt;i&gt;Wall Street&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Tech slang is also playing a role in the case. Notes from one Uber meeting showed Kalanick saying the company should get "cheat codes" for self-driving technology. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Verhoeven characterized "cheat codes" as codes designed to allow gamers to advance to the next level without earning points through the game to get there. But at one point in court, Kalanick defined the term another way, as anything that lets someone avoid a task or investment. He said one example of a "cheat code" might be Uber collecting real-time motion data from its cars as they stop and start at traffic lights. In aggregate, that data could allow Uber to tell what lights were red or green all across a city without having to install cameras to watch the lights. The data could be used for route planning and other applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial before Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco continues Thursday and is expected to last about three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers are curious about autonomous commercial vehicles --everything from long haul trucks to factory floor forklifts -- but are so far taking a wait-and-see approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the finding of a PwC and The Manufacturing Institute (MI) survey of 128 large and midsized American manufacturers and transportation companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 60% of manufacturers surveyed cited cost as one of the top barriers to adoption of semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles within their plants, followed by immature technology (42%) and safety issues (32%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While only 9% of manufacturers have adopted some type of semi-autonomous or autonomous mobility within their operations, the &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/industrial-products/library/industrial-mobility.html"target="new"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; indicated another 10% are expecting to do so in the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also revealed US investments in private mobility companies totaled $6.8 billion for mobility startups between 2012 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think the technology to support autonomous long-haul trucking technology will approach maturity in the next five to ten years," Greg Roger, policy analyst at the Eno Center for Transportation told PwC in an interview included in the report. "However, we're still 10 to 20 years off from having fully driverless trucks from being a common sight on the roads."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roger added that he thought the fear of displacing human workers and the general public's initial safety concerns will keep drivers in the trucks for at least another decade or two into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are also concerns that autonomous trucks represent a threat to jobs in the same way automation in general has some economists worried, an Uber &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@UberATG/the-future-of-trucking-b3d2ea0d2db9/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; suggests self-driving commercial vehicles could actually be a boost to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey cites a &lt;a href="http://www.trucking.org/ATA%20Docs/News%20and%20Information/Reports%20Trends%20and%20Statistics/10%206%2015%20ATAs%20Driver%20Shortage%20Report%202015.pdf"target="new"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the American Trucking Associations, which estimates that over the next decade, more than 400,000 of today's drivers will retire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over that same time period, the ATA predicts that demand for freight will increase by 37%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report projected that if the industry continues down its current path, approximately 900,000 new drivers will be needed to keep up with future demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Autonomous commercial trucks could eventually have a positive impact on the driver shortage, but we are still years away from truly driverless Class 8 trucks running on the highway as a normal part of the industry," the ATA report noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uber report noted the biggest technical hurdles for self-driving trucks are driving on tight and crowded city streets, backing into complex loading docks, and navigating through busy facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Embark Technology, a startup developing self-driving trucks, announced it had completed a coast-to-coast, 2,400-mile journey from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Fla., test drive with a semi-autonomous truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some high-profile successes, a 2017 J.D. Power &lt;a href="http://www.jdpower.com/cars/articles/jd-power-studies/2017-us-tech-choice-study-results/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; indicates Americans have only grown more skeptical of the safety of autonomous vehicles as they've evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excepting only Gen Y -- those born 1977-1994 -- all other generational groups have grown more skeptical of self-driving car technology, according to the firm's 2017 U.S. Tech Choice Study, a finding that could indicate a new challenge to car manufacturers and technology developers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The surprise settlement of Waymo's trade-secrets lawsuit against Uber last week may have saved both companies from the harsh glare of the spotlight, but it probably won't determine who supplies your first driverless ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740331" target="new"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Uber of using its trade secrets to develop Lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars and sought as much as $1.8 billion in damages. But last Friday, the companies announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740475&amp;" target="new"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; in which Waymo will get a small stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, and a commitment from the ride-hailing giant not to use Waymo's confidential hardware or software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The settlement, which the companies reached late on February 8 after only four days in court, ended a trial that was expected to last three weeks. A federal jury and a media throng had already heard unsettling tales of take-no-prisoners culture that Uber is trying to put behind it. Waymo ran the risk, like any litigant, of losing its case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal may allow the companies to take another shot at a partnership they had discussed several times since 2013: Waymo -- then known as Google's Project Chauffeur -- had driverless cars, and Uber had a popular ride-hailing service. When the planned partnership never actually took shape, Uber started developing its own autonomous technology and the two companies ended up on a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740419" target="new"&gt;collision course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this wasn't a clash between full-fledged rivals in a mature business, like the years-long smartphone litigation between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co." target="new"&gt;Apple and Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. So far, the self-driving car industry is essentially a set of experiments. That's why all eyes are on the basic technologies -- for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Early on, it's going to be about technology leadership. But later on, it's going to be about business models and supply chains," said Bob O'Donnell, president of market research and consulting firm Technalysis Research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Uber was using stolen Waymo designs -- which Uber denies -- the settlement may cost the company some time in its quest to make cars drive themselves, which ultimately affects its bottom line and market value, O'Donnell said. "The entire business model of Uber is based on the fact that eventually they aren't going to have to pay anybody." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by 2030, when various forecasts predict autonomous cars will perform &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/25-of-u-s-driving-could-be-done-by-self-driving-cars-by-2030-study-finds/" target="new"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; of our trips  as much as &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/rethinkx-selfdriving-electric-cars-will-dominate-roads-by-2030" target="new"&gt;95%&lt;/a&gt; of all miles driven  last week's settlement may be a nothing more than a footnote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's important now, but in 12 years, the market dynamics will also have changed a lot," O'Donnell said. The sky's the limit on what could happen by then. Uber might have acquired Waymo, or vice versa. And everyone in today's car business, including both automakers and component suppliers like Bosch and Continental, is looking for a piece of the business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There's not going to be one winner. Even if Waymo has a head start now, that's not the end of the story," O'Donnell said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, all the winners will need partners to succeed. The whole car industry is a complex web of manufacturers and suppliers. Even Tesla relies on third parties for some of its technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a good chance Waymo will eventually be a technology supplier to Uber, Lyft -- where it's already invested $1 billion -- and other mobility providers, O'Donnell said. Just because Waymo will soon be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740141" target="new"&gt;pick you up&lt;/a&gt; in a driverless SUV in a few cities doesn't mean it wants to break into the ride-hailing business for good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What may seem like an epic battle for the streets in a San Francisco courtroom is really a fringe fight to most consumers, O'Donnell said. "There's the Silicon Valley view of the world, and then there's the actual world."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Technalysis survey of 1,000 US consumers last year found that 57% had never used a ride-hailing service and another 23% had only done it once or twice. So what was imminently at stake here wasn't personal transportation in the suburbs and midsized cities of America. It was reputation, the most valuable commodity in Silicon Valley -- after coding skills and a killer funding round.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Uber's latest financial results suggest the company was glad to end its expensive court battle with Waymo but is still anxious to get driverless cars on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The ride-hailing giant told investors it lost $4.5 billion in 2017, according to a &lt;a href=" https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/uber-sales-reach-7-5-billion-in-2017-despite-persistent-turmoil" target="new"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; report. But excluding legal expenses and some other costs, such as stock-based compensation and taxes, the loss was only $2.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;A week ago, Uber was facing a $1.8 billion trade-secrets lawsuit by Waymo in a case that set a record for packing lawyers into Judge William Alsup's federal courtroom in San Francisco. Each side had nine attorneys on hand for the &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740331" target="new"&gt;opening arguments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740475" target="new"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; reached last Thursday ended what was expected to be a three-week trial, as Uber gave Alphabet's autonomous car business a $245 million equity stake and a commitment not to use the company's trade secrets. Waymo had accused Uber of using eight stolen hardware secrets in a frantic bid to catch up in driverless cars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars are cool, but they're also a key part of Uber's financial future, holding out the prospect of running its ride-hailing business without drivers. That would eliminate both a huge portion of Uber's costs and a part of its business that has led to controversy and legal battles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This war for self-driving is truly existential for Uber: we'll either start up our second S curve of growth or we'll die," Uber Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden wrote in an email to then-CEO Travis Kalanick in 2016 that was presented as evidence in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate business model of the money-losing company, founded in 2009 and now worth an estimated $68 billion, may depend on driverless cars. Uber is taking in more money than ever. In last year's fourth quarter, its net revenue was $2.22 billion, up 61% from a year earlier, Bloomberg reported. Sales for the whole year reached $7.5 billion, up from about $6.5 billion in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's losses may be narrowing. For 2016, it reported an adjusted net loss of $2.8 billion, excluding results from its China business, which was sold off in July of that year. 
Still, the company ended 2017 with less cash than it started with: $6 billion, down 13% from the end of 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things may be looking up for Uber, which went through a dramatic and public meltdown last year over its internal culture and alleged spying practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Kalanick resigned as CEO under pressure, though he remained on the company's sometimes contentious board. Dara Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia executive, took over as CEO in August. In late December, Uber sold a 15% stake to Japan's SoftBank Group, reportedly at a discount to its $68 billion valuation. And driverless cars are &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740108" target="new"&gt;on the way&lt;/a&gt;: Uber has said it plans to offer &lt;a href=" https://futurism.com/first-driverless-uber-hit-road-soon-2019/" target="new"&gt;autonomous rides&lt;/a&gt; commercially in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Visibility systems specialist Seeva announced it has raised $2 million in seed funding to grow the company's team and continue developing its products to help autonomous vehicles perform better on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funds included investment from Revolution's Rise of the Rest (ROTR) Seed Fund, a $150 million fund backed by high-profile investors such as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seed round also included support from Dynamo VC, Expansion VC, Haystack VC and Trucks VC, which funds entrepreneurs building the future of transportation.

&lt;p&gt;Seeva designs visibility systems for mobility, and its first proprietary product, SEEVAtherm, is designed to clean windshields, cameras, Lidar and other sensors to help vehicles see more safely and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluid can be directed anywhere on the vehicle to clear the visibility ecosystem, as well as other autonomous vehicle (AV) and advanced driver assistance (ADAS) hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2016, Seeva is a graduate of the Techstars Mobility program and is jointly headquartered in Seattle and Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When Jere Lansinger, my co-founder and dad, retired from Chrysler after forty years as an automotive engineer, he took with him an approved list of projects he continued to tinker with into retirement," Diane Lansinger, co-founder and CEO of Seeva, said in a statement. "This is how Seeva started."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing the visibility problems facing autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems, Lanhesigner created a washer fluid heating product that cleans and helps these vehicles see more safely and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's first market-ready product, called QwikTherm, is a mechanical only system that rapidly heats up washer fluid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's website &lt;a href="https://www.seeva.tech/our-story/"target="new"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that when the elder Lansigner found out in 2016 that two major automotive companies wanted to buy his patented washer fluid heating system, he called his daughter Diane for help launching it on the business side and developing a company around his IP portfolio of "visibility for mobility" innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"At Seeva, we're creating a trustworthy family of innovative, patent-protected products that are going to build driver and rider confidence in self-driving cars by making the hardware and software in these autonomous vehicles see the road more clearly," she continued.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As more and more cars become equipped with cameras and sensors, these systems will be essential in the development of the autonomous vehicle, and so will sensor cleaning -- to provide a good visibility in all conditions and for an infallible security, sensors must be perfectly clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeva is not the only company working in this sector. Valeo, an automotive supplier, has also proposed a full range of systems for washing optical sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's Visibility Systems Business Group, made up of two product groups -- wiper systems and lighting systems -- designs and produces technologies to ensure the best possible visibility and safety for drivers in all weather conditions, both day and night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wiper systems product group develops technologies that clean windshields, rear windows and optical sensors to offer drivers and autonomous cars improved visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These solutions are designed not only for increased comfort and safety, but also reduced weight, thereby reducing CO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German automotive parts supplier Continental has also developed cleaning systems for on-board sensors such as video cameras, radars and Lidars to keep autonomous vehicles operating safely.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Consumers expect improvements in the safety of autonomous vehicles, yet they still want to be able to take over the wheel at any time, according to the results of a TV Rheinland survey of more than 1,000 licensed drivers aged 18 or older in China, Germany and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also &lt;a href="https://www.tuv.com/news/en/corporate/about_us_1/press/news_2/newscontent_cw_358793.html/TV%20Rheinland%20Releases%20Wide-Ranging%20Study%20on%20Global%20Consumer%20Perception%20of%20Autonomous%20Vehicle%20Safety/"target="new"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; trust in the technology behind completely autonomous cars is nearly twice as high in China as in the other two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, fear of cybercrime around autonomous vehicles is widespread among global motorists, with more than three quarters -- 76% -- of respondents in Germany fearing personal data could fall into unauthorized hands when using autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For drivers in the US, having a permanent option for the driver to take full control of the vehicle was the top priority -- 47% -- followed by proof of functional safety through tests -- 45% -- and the protection of the car against unauthorized access -- 43%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety was a primary motivation for sharing data, with between 30% and 50% of motorists surveyed in all three countries indicating a specific desire to make their data available for breakdown assistance services, car insurance companies and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the survey indicated motorists are less willing to transmit their data to service and mobility providers, particular data app providers, automotive suppliers, automobile dealers and infrastructure operators such as gas stations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents in all three countries appeared to worry autonomous cars could lead to increased vehicle crime due to people accessing the vehicles through technical means and data theft -- and a majority of respondents said they think the systems of future cars should be updated automatically over-the-air as a defense against cyber criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 63% of respondents in China said they believe driverless cars will increase road safety, while the figure dropped to 34% in Germany and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When we see large swaths of motorists in China, Germany, and the USA share a belief that road safety will decrease as automation increases, it tells us we must give people much more information and communicate the benefits of autonomous technology more clearly," Dr. Matthias Schubert, executive vice president of mobility at TV Rheinland, wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sharing of data, 42% of US drivers surveyed reported it is fine to pass on their data for updating and using new services, for instance telematics services such as parking space finders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, 55% of respondents in the US told researchers that they are not well informed about which data is used for which purpose, who has access to the data and how well-protected the data is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey follows AAA's annual &lt;a href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/2018/01/americans-willing-ride-fully-self-driving-cars/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on American drivers' perceptions of self-driving vehicle safety, which was released in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That study found drivers are beginning to embrace self-driving vehicles, with 63% of US drivers reporting feeling afraid to ride in a fully self-driving vehicle, a significant drop from 78% in early 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Americans still appear wary of driving alongside autonomous vehicles with only 13% of US drivers reported they would feel safer sharing the road with a self-driving vehicle, while close to half reported that they would actually feel less safe.&lt;/p&gt;

  <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Bumper-to-bumper traffic may become a hassle of the past as more and more self-driving vehicles take to the roads in the coming years, according to a report by a Rutgers UniversityCamden team of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found that the intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle (AV) is able to dampen stop-and-go waves of traffic that can arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researcher's experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles showed that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01693" target="new"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; compared metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments, and the findings suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management -- the introduction of only 5% of autonomous cars into traffic could have noticeable results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common wave triggers include lane changing but can even be generated in the absence of any lane changes, bottlenecks, merges or changes in grade.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Since these waves emerge from the collective dynamics of the drivers on the road, they are in principle avoidable if one could affect the way people drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report's conclusions suggest these waves can be reduced by controlling a small number of vehicles in the traffic stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced communications systems will also be an important component for automated vehicles. The most common communication methods are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V2V communication involves one vehicle being able to inform other vehicles within a given proximity of important decisions it makes, while V2I communications involve sending information to, and accepting information from, traffic infrastructure, such as a traffic signal informing a vehicle of a red light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by Benedetto Piccoli, associate provost for research at Rutgers University-Camden, the study found a single autonomous vehicle can control the flow of at least 20 human-controlled vehicles around it, with substantial reductions in excessive braking and fuel consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research comes as the use of a small number of GPS-equipped vehicles in the traffic stream has increased dramatically, changing how traffic is monitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though gathering this real-time traffic data previously required predominantly fixed sensing infrastructure, recent advancements in vehicular automation and communication technologies provide new possibilities and opportunities for traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when a series of adjacent vehicles on a roadway are connected and automated, it is possible to form dense platoons of vehicles which leave very small gaps, in theory eliminating the stop-and-go waves that form so-called "phantom" traffic jams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"AVs can revolutionize the control of traffic flow," the report noted. "They offer the potential to shift from localized control measures, like ramp metering, and centralized ones, as variable speed limit gantries, to actuators immersed in the traffic stream."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the presented ring experiments represent a stretch of single-lane roadway, the theory also extends to multi-lane freeways, on which lane-changing can serve as an additional trigger of stop-and-go waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings were presented to policymakers in Washington, DC at an exhibit at the Washington Auto Show, including US Sen. John Thune, chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Most of the policymakers, car manufacturers, car dealers, and others we talked with were very impressed with the research results and got a positive feeling about autonomous vehicles," Piccoli &lt;a href="https://news.camden.rutgers.edu/2018/02/study-shows-autonomous-vehicles-can-help-improve-traffic-flow/"target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Rutgers-Camden News Now. "They all agreed that the impact on real traffic economy and environmental impact could be of great importance."&lt;/p&gt;
