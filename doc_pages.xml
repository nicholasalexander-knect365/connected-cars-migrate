    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Automotive cybersecurity specialist Argus Cyber Security announced a partnership with connectivity and communications service provider Ericsson to offer cybersecurity tools for connected cars, which will include cloud-based services delivered to fleets as well as individual vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The two companies will work together to help enable automakers to securely integrate and monetize the connected vehicle ecosystem. The partnership was announced February 26 at the start of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The collaboration involves integrating Argus Security Operation Center with Ericsson's Connected Vehicle Cloud platform to provide automakers with an additional layer of security that leverages intelligence findings across both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The combination of Argus's and Ericsson's offerings is aimed at providing automakers cyber security coverage of the cloud, connected services and entire vehicle fleets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The combined insights provide automakers with actionable intelligence derived from big data analysis across millions of connected vehicles and their cloud services to identify the first signs of an attack campaign and mitigate its damage by rapidly immunizing the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The collaboration leverages Ericsson's communications expertise, built over 140 years and from connecting billions of people through connectivity infrastructure, and Argus' experience in cyber security and automotive, as well as the innovation of 39 granted and pending patents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Argus connectivity protection defends the infotainment or telematics units by preventing malware installation, detecting operating system anomalies, isolating suspicious applications and stopping attacks spreading to the in-vehicle network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition, this suite secures the two-way communication channel with the outside world and operates across platforms -- Linux, QNX, Android and others -- to protect the car's most vulnerable attack surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company's electric control units (ECU) protection technology protects different parts of the car, such as brakes, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), door control units or any other units deemed critical, from attacks originating inside and outside of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Located on the ECU, this suite detects and prevents incoming attacks, as well as neutralizes malware resulting from supply chain attacks or other attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"In order to enable an increasing number of vehicle cloud services to interact with a vehicle, we see the need for a holistic cyber security strategy, which demands multi-layered, end-to-end cyber security covering every node in the ecosystem, throughout a vehicle's lifespan," Yoni Heilbronn, chief marketing officer for Argus Cyber Security, noted in &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/argus-cyber-security-collaborates-with-ericsson-to-spearhead-seamless-end-to-end-cyber-security-across-connected-services-and-vehicles-300603771.html/"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Heilbronn explained that through the partnership with Ericsson, Argus is looking to help automakers ensure the security and privacy of their customers through comprehensive cyber security solutions and services, while simultaneously maintaining consumer trust and brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition, Argus' multi-layered cyber security solutions embedded in the vehicle provide real-time protection from cyber-attacks, including attacks on remote vehicle commands originating from the cloud, such as heating the interior cabin and opening the vehicle door, through a smartphone applications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We are offering a proposition for automotive OEMs through the combination of Ericsson's Connected Vehicle Cloud's ability to manage a large number of connected vehicles with an in-vehicle expert like Argus and its capabilities for vehicle protection and threat detection," Claes Herlitz, head of connected vehicles at Ericsson wrote in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Argus, an independent company of Elektrobit, a provider of automotive software products and services, also offers an over-the-air (OTA) software update tool that enables them to improve performance and security, as well as deploy new features throughout the vehicle's lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Mercedes-Benz parent company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740802&amp;"target="new"&gt;Daimler and Bosch let the world know&lt;/a&gt; they are partnering on a self-driving taxi that would begin testing itself on city streets in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The idea of cars silently signaling each other through walls is as futuristic as it sounds, but many electronics suppliers want to get going on it as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On February 22, Qualcomm &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualcomm-and-leading-automotive-companies-across-the-globe-drive-the-commercialization-of-c-v2x-300602527.html" target="new"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; a long list of companies looking to use its 9150 C-V2X chipset, which is due to be demonstrated this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and shipped commercially in the second half of this year. The list includes well-known names such as BMW, LG Electronics, Continental, Sierra Wireless and ZTE. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/technologies/lte/advanced-pro/cellular-v2x" target="new"&gt;C-V2X&lt;/a&gt;, or cellular vehicle-to-anything, is a way to use cellular radios in cars to communicate with other vehicles, pedestrians' phones, and roadway infrastructure such as traffic signals and warning signs. One use of C-V2X would be to notify cars approaching a blind intersection that there's a speeding vehicle around the corner that's about to run a red light. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It's important for many different suppliers to join in on a technology like C-V2X, because it can't deliver benefits like safety unless a lot of things use the same system. Vendors from different industries all need to sign on. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;C-V2X uses 5G technology and is designed as one element of a complex set of sensors and networks, including Lidar and radar, that may someday keep self-driving cars informed about everything around them. Before that, C-V2X might help to keep manually driven vehicles from crashing into each other. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Automotive wireless networks such as C-V2X are starting to overcome the limits of human vision and robotic line of sight. With wireless signaling, cars can virtually see each other even where drivers can't and respond appropriately. In the example of the red-light runner at a blind corner, vehicles approaching the intersection could automatically brake or warn drivers to brake. If the traffic light had the right wireless radio, it might send a warning to the oncoming car or even stop it from running the red. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;C-V2X isn't the only way to make all this work. There's also a wireless LAN standard related to WiFi that's used in technologies such as WLANp and Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC). Volkswagen Group &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740672" target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that it would equip all its European cars with WLANp beginning next year. The US government has been pushing DSRC for several years. Qualcomm also has products in this category. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But Qualcomm says it has a global ecosystem of automakers, component suppliers, software companies and system integrators committed to C-V2X and the 9150 chipset. They include participants in China, South Korea, Japan, Germany, France and the US. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the selling points for C-V2X is that it could build on the 5G mobile ecosystem and take advantage of carriers' cellular networks. In addition to direct wireless links among cars and nearby infrastructure like signs, C-V2X can connect cars to the larger cellular network. Those vehicle-to-network links could be used for services like traffic and hazard warnings, locations of parking spots, and streaming information and entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;An average commuter spends 14% of his or her waking hours in the car, according to a study conducted by Arbitron/Edison Media Group. With Internet of Things (IoT) and newer technologies, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, revving up the automotive industry, the connected car is giving commuters newer ways to make rush hour more relaxing or productive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Today's consumer is connected in three places -- their home, their office and their local coffee shop -- with evidence of companies shifting from connected car pilots to programs, connected cars are quickly steering their way into the becoming the "third place."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For a long time now, Starbucks has been known as a third place with its goal to provide all the comforts of home and office while enjoying a cup of coffee with friends and colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The convergence of data, device and design, as well as advances in telematics, sensor technologies, in-vehicle infotainment and the cloud, will continue to shape the future of cars, making them ready to adopt more end-to-end technology solutions to provide newer ways to connect the home, office and casual driving experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let's dig deeper into what is driving this momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Creating the ultimate experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  Today, the automobile industry is changing at breakneck speed. The cars we drive are changing, and so are the ways we commute.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The initial excitement is often overshadowed by uncertainty and reluctance to try something new. The focus on user experience (UX) is driving a profound shift in how connected cars are envisioned. In fact, UX is fast becoming the defining strategy of every company shifting toward the connected car market share. Forward-thinking UX holds up a mirror to the future that is a perfect "third place."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Evolving the continuum &amp;ndash; digital lifestyles &amp; cars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  Mechanical excellence is no longer the battleground for automakers. To create meaningful innovations and capture consumers' interest in digital lifestyle, automakers must strive to understand users and care about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is all about building less of a machine and more of a car as a companion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This evolution will require a collaboration between those who understand and advocate for the user and those who strategize and integrate the technology. Together, they will create cars of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Putting data in the driver's seat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  Cars are increasingly becoming data powerhouses as they become ever more connected and empowered by smart, IoT technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The richness of insights is unlocking a digital gold rush around the connected car, transforming vehicles to be as unique as the people in them. The ability to carry out predictive, machine-learning driven analytics across datasets is creating huge potential for innovation. Putting this data in the driver's seat of the connected car will enhance the comfort and convenience of commuters.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Bringing new levels of connectivity to the car&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  The automobile industry is a part of the same revolution that fuels our desire to stay connected -- anywhere, anytime. Connectivity is no longer an option, it is a key feature in turning your car into a customized extension of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Be it Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) or even Vehicles-to-Phones, the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology incorporates connectivity into, well, everything.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Software is the new hardware&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  We no longer have "car companies" -- these businesses are increasingly turning into software giants. Software-based platforms, of which AI-based technologies are a part, tend to make every aspect of the connected car more essential and also more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are two key imperatives to get ahead of this inevitable disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The first is user-centered design, or UCD.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;UCD is an amalgamation of design and science with the goal of making products and services user-desirable, business-viable and technologically feasible. Factor in behaviors, preferences, context, goals and aspirations while defining the connected car strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ask questions, build uses cases, personalize the experience. What is their "Job-To-be-Done?" What are their priorities? Are they doing five other things at the same time? How can the car help improve their lifestyle?&lt;/P&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The second is collaboration and co-creation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whether it is be it incremental or breakthrough innovation, the concept of siloed genius dies hard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Although it is imperative for automakers to leverage their independent expertise and clout, isolated actions lead to a fragmented experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Too many existing companies have evolved into silos of expertise. To succeed, leveraging partnerships and participating in ecosystems becomes crucial for automotive manufacturers, suppliers and service providers.&lt;/P&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The next few years will be an incredibly creative period. The cars we drive will change more than they have in the last century and become the true third place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A bill moving through the Utah legislature would legalize self-driving cars across the state and set up licensing, registration and insurance rules for them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;House Bill &lt;a href=" https://le.utah.gov/~2018/bills/static/HB0371.html" target="new"&gt;371&lt;/a&gt;, which a legislative committee endorsed and sent to the full House of Representatives on Wednesday, February 21, could make Utah a leading state in allowing autonomous vehicles to roam across urban and rural areas. Under the proposed law, local governments couldn't impose their own regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Utah is the 13th largest state by area, spanning sparsely populated deserts and snowy mountains -- a particular challenge for fledgling robot drivers -- as well as the sprawling Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Robert Spendlove, a Republican from Sandy, says it could help the state's growing technology sector to take the lead in self-driving cars, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/02/22/utah-soon-could-be-first-state-to-fully-legalize-self-driving-cars-on-its-roads/" target="new"&gt;Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Supporters say allowing self-driving cars will help to make roads safer because robot cars don't run red lights, drive drunk or text while driving. (Surveys suggest consumers &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740775&amp;" target="new"&gt;haven't quite bought&lt;/a&gt; the safety argument yet.) &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Spendlove's bill would set up a standard way for owners to register and insure autonomous cars. It would also make sure crashes are handled the same way when there's no driver behind the wheel: The self-driving car would have to remain at the scene, just like a human driver does, and the car's owner would have to report the crash. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The bill will define different rules for each level of autonomous technology, from Level 1 systems like adaptive cruise control to future Level 5 vehicles that won't need a driver, pedals or a steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Though it mostly amends existing laws, it's an ambitious measure on a technology that's still evolving and controversial. Spendlove has said he may put off the bill's effective date until the middle of next year to allow for more work on it. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The promise of tech investment and the prospect of driverless vehicles hitting the road in the next few years are leading many states to craft laws and programs to deal with these cars. This month, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740650" target="new"&gt;Massachusetts and Indiana&lt;/a&gt; have debated autonomous vehicle regulation and the District of Columbia has created an agency to prepare for testing and other developments. Legislatures in five states have passed laws on autonomous vehicles, and 30 others have considered legislation, according to the &lt;a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Automated_Driving:_Legislative_and_Regulatory_Action" target="new"&gt;Center for Internet and Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some proponents of the technology say the growing patchwork of laws could hamper the industry, and the federal government is trying to step in with &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740572" target="new"&gt;national regulations&lt;/a&gt;. But states that step forward may stand to gain. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Arizona, which is home to some chipmaking operations but not one of the country's biggest tech or car hubs, has become a hotbed of self-driving activity since its governor gave an executive order on autonomous vehicles in 2015. Late last month, the state gave Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740723&amp;" target="new"&gt; license to operate&lt;/a&gt; a car-for-hire service with its driverless minivans. Waymo's operations so far have been focused on the greater Phoenix area. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Global auto supplier Bosch has now launched a connected mobility technology division, which includes the acquisition of a US-based ridesharing service startup, Splitting Fares.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The plan is for the new division to further extend its existing service portfolio, promoting mobility technologies that can send alerts about wrong-way drivers or turn smartphones into car keys.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An aggressive investor in autonomous vehicle technology, Bosch likely sees the potential for growth in ride-sharing, which encompasses online services and apps for carpools as well as for arranging driving services and taxis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://splt.io/"target="new"&gt;Splitting Fares&lt;/a&gt; has developed a platform that organizations might use to arrange ridesharing for their staff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company, founded in 2015, has some 140,000 users in the US, Mexico, and Germany. The company has collected about $1.3 million in venture capital funding, according to &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/splitting-fares--splt-#section-overview"target="new"&gt;CrunchBase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Its approach is aimed directly at commuters, with an app bringing together user who want to share a ride to the same workplace or place of study.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The main selling point behind the idea is that rides are shared by colleagues, which means users never have to get in the car with complete strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An algorithm is designed to locate a suitable ride-share vehicle, then it calculates the fastest route through traffic, and coordinates the departure point, departure time, best route and passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The chairman of the Bosch board of management, Volkmar Denner, speaking at a company conference in Berlin, &lt;a href="http://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/bosch-establishes-division-for-connected-mobility-services-144832.html/"target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition is part of their plan to rapidly grow their service portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By 2022, the number of ride-sharing users worldwide is set to rise by 60% to 685 million, according to a recent Statista &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/368/100/ride-sharing/worldwide#/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To date, most such services have been directed at people who happen to be traveling in the same direction or who want to book a trip at the last minute, while companies and commuters have been seen as less of a priority -- something Splitting Fares was angling to change.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"Connectivity will fundamentally change how we get from A to B, and in the process it will help to solve today’s traffic problems," Denner said. "We are using it to realize our vision of emissions-free, stress-free, and accident-free mobility."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He went on to explain the company feels connectivity offers tremendous business potential, noting that by 2025, there will be more than 470 million connected vehicles on the world’s roads.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a PwC report indicates, in only four years from now, the market for mobility services and associated digital services will be worth $175 million.

  &lt;p&gt;"Connectivity is a way for us to rethink not just the car but the whole way we use modes of transport," Denner said. "For Bosch, mobility goes beyond the car. Our expertise puts us in a position to develop and operate cross-application ecosystems."

  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Mercedes-Benz parent company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740316"target="new"&gt;Daimler and Bosch&lt;/a&gt; let the world know"target="new"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they are partnering on a self-driving taxi that would begin testing itself on city streets in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous-car promoters say the technology they love will someday do many great things for humanity, including making roads safer and helping the elderly get around.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, according to a &lt;a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/228032/americans-hit-brakes-self-driving-cars.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="new"&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt; released February 21, robot vehicles have already done the impossible: Unite Americans of all ages, genders, regions and educational backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Young and old, college-educated or not, more adults across the US are worried about self-driving cars and trucks than are feeling gung-ho about them, Gallup found.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Those results, which are based on interviews with nearly 3,300 US adults, are the latest evidence that while carmakers and Silicon Valley companies are heading into the autonomous future at top speed, many of the consumers they expect to buy into the new technology still prefer to go slow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: 54% of US adults say it's unlikely they'll even use fully self-driving cars. Only 25% say it's likely. Even among those 18 to 35, only 36% expect to take the leap. Americans with college degrees think it's iffy (39% to 38%), while those with less education overwhelmingly doubt they'll go driverless.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Gallup's findings echo those of a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740709&amp;" target="new"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; released this week by TÜV Rheinland, which found that many consumers in the US and Europe don't trust self-driving cars -- though those in China are much more open to the new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Last fall, Gallup asked 3,297 US adults about their feelings on a scale from "extremely uncomfortable" to "extremely comfortable."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Riding in a self-driving car every day would make 59% of Americans uncomfortable, the survey found. More than two-thirds of those over age 66 gave that response, but even among 18-to-35-year-olds, half said they wouldn't be comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Education may open consumers up to the idea a little.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Only 45% of people with a bachelor's degree were uncomfortable with the idea -- but only 33% actually said they were comfortable with it. For those with less education, the split was 65% to 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sharing the road with self-driving trucks drew even stronger reactions. Overall, 62% of those surveyed said they were uneasy about getting on the road with robot trucks, and only 20% said it would be OK. Again, about half of the youngest group wasn't quite ready.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These results may be bad news for those who want legislators and the public to embrace autonomous vehicles. Entire industries, including ride-hailing and &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603493/10-breakthrough-technologies-2017-self-driving-trucks/" target="new"&gt;long-haul trucking&lt;/a&gt;, have a lot riding on self-driving technology to cut costs and scale up their businesses. Tens of billions of dollars have been invested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What happens if consumers don't buy in?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740086" target="new"&gt;retirement communities&lt;/a&gt; are considered a key early market for driverless ride-hailing, due to quiet streets and residents who've had to give up driving, yet more than two-thirds of people over 66 told Gallup they don't think they'll ever use a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There may be hard times ahead, but here's a potential glimmer of hope: &lt;a href="http://news.gallup.com/vault/227810/gallup-vault-misjudging-cellphone-adoption.aspx?g_source=link_newsv9&amp;g_campaign=item_228032&amp;g_medium=copy" target="new"&gt;In 2000&lt;/a&gt;, about one in five adults (not even counting seniors) told Gallup they would never get a cellphone. Now, 95% of Americans have one. Maybe the other 5% just can't find it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Bumper-to-bumper traffic may become a hassle of the past as more and more self-driving vehicles take to the roads in the coming years, according to a report by a Rutgers University–Camden team of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The study found that the intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle (AV) is able to dampen stop-and-go waves of traffic that can arise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The researcher's experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles showed that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01693" target="new"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; compared metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments, and the findings suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management -- the introduction of only 5% of autonomous cars into traffic could have noticeable results.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Common wave triggers include lane changing but can even be generated in the absence of any lane changes, bottlenecks, merges or changes in grade.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Since these waves emerge from the collective dynamics of the drivers on the road, they are in principle avoidable if one could affect the way people drive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The report's conclusions suggest these waves can be reduced by controlling a small number of vehicles in the traffic stream.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Advanced communications systems will also be an important component for automated vehicles. The most common communication methods are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;V2V communication involves one vehicle being able to inform other vehicles within a given proximity of important decisions it makes, while V2I communications involve sending information to, and accepting information from, traffic infrastructure, such as a traffic signal informing a vehicle of a red light.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Led by Benedetto Piccoli, associate provost for research at Rutgers University-Camden, the study found a single autonomous vehicle can control the flow of at least 20 human-controlled vehicles around it, with substantial reductions in excessive braking and fuel consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The research comes as the use of a small number of GPS-equipped vehicles in the traffic stream has increased dramatically, changing how traffic is monitored.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Though gathering this real-time traffic data previously required predominantly fixed sensing infrastructure, recent advancements in vehicular automation and communication technologies provide new possibilities and opportunities for traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For example, when a series of adjacent vehicles on a roadway are connected and automated, it is possible to form dense platoons of vehicles which leave very small gaps, in theory eliminating the stop-and-go waves that form so-called "phantom" traffic jams.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"AVs can revolutionize the control of traffic flow," the report noted. "They offer the potential to shift from localized control measures, like ramp metering, and centralized ones, as variable speed limit gantries, to actuators immersed in the traffic stream."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While the presented ring experiments represent a stretch of single-lane roadway, the theory also extends to multi-lane freeways, on which lane-changing can serve as an additional trigger of stop-and-go waves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The findings were presented to policymakers in Washington, DC at an exhibit at the Washington Auto Show, including US Sen. John Thune, chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Most of the policymakers, car manufacturers, car dealers, and others we talked with were very impressed with the research results and got a positive feeling about autonomous vehicles," Piccoli &lt;a href="https://news.camden.rutgers.edu/2018/02/study-shows-autonomous-vehicles-can-help-improve-traffic-flow/"target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Rutgers-Camden News Now. "They all agreed that the impact on real traffic economy and environmental impact could be of great importance."&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Consumers expect improvements in the safety of autonomous vehicles, yet they still want to be able to take over the wheel at any time, according to the results of a TÜV Rheinland survey of more than 1,000 licensed drivers aged 18 or older in China, Germany and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The study also &lt;a href="https://www.tuv.com/news/en/corporate/about_us_1/press/news_2/newscontent_cw_358793.html/TÜV%20Rheinland%20Releases%20Wide-Ranging%20Study%20on%20Global%20Consumer%20Perception%20of%20Autonomous%20Vehicle%20Safety/"target="new"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; trust in the technology behind completely autonomous cars is nearly twice as high in China as in the other two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, fear of cybercrime around autonomous vehicles is widespread among global motorists, with more than three quarters -- 76% -- of respondents in Germany fearing personal data could fall into unauthorized hands when using autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For drivers in the US, having a permanent option for the driver to take full control of the vehicle was the top priority -- 47% -- followed by proof of functional safety through tests -- 45% -- and the protection of the car against unauthorized access -- 43%.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Safety was a primary motivation for sharing data, with between 30% and 50% of motorists surveyed in all three countries indicating a specific desire to make their data available for breakdown assistance services, car insurance companies and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, the survey indicated motorists are less willing to transmit their data to service and mobility providers, particular data app providers, automotive suppliers, automobile dealers and infrastructure operators such as gas stations. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Respondents in all three countries appeared to worry autonomous cars could lead to increased vehicle crime due to people accessing the vehicles through technical means and data theft -- and a majority of respondents said they think the systems of future cars should be updated automatically over-the-air as a defense against cyber criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;More than 63% of respondents in China said they believe driverless cars will increase road safety, while the figure dropped to 34% in Germany and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"When we see large swaths of motorists in China, Germany, and the USA share a belief that road safety will decrease as automation increases, it tells us we must give people much more information and communicate the benefits of autonomous technology more clearly," Dr. Matthias Schubert, executive vice president of mobility at TÜV Rheinland, wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to sharing of data, 42% of US drivers surveyed reported it is fine to pass on their data for updating and using new services, for instance telematics services such as parking space finders.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, 55% of respondents in the US told researchers that they are not well informed about which data is used for which purpose, who has access to the data and how well-protected the data is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The survey follows AAA's annual &lt;a href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/2018/01/americans-willing-ride-fully-self-driving-cars/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on American drivers' perceptions of self-driving vehicle safety, which was released in January.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That study found drivers are beginning to embrace self-driving vehicles, with 63% of US drivers reporting feeling afraid to ride in a fully self-driving vehicle, a significant drop from 78% in early 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Still, Americans still appear wary of driving alongside autonomous vehicles with only 13% of US drivers reported they would feel safer sharing the road with a self-driving vehicle, while close to half reported that they would actually feel less safe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Waymo has won permission from Arizona to turn its futuristic self-driving taxi experiment in Phoenix into a commercial service.&lt;/p&gt;

  With a &lt;a href="https://www.azdot.gov/docs/default-source/motor-vehicle-services/vehicle-for-hire/vfh-valid-permits-tnc.pdf?sfvrsn=46" target="new"&gt;vehicle-for-hire permit&lt;/a&gt; in hand, the autonomous car division of Google parent company Alphabet is one step closer to launching the service it's been trying out around Phoenix for several months. Arizona issued the permit on January 24, according to &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1208897/alphabets-waymo-googl-is-readying-a-ride-hailing-service-in-arizona-that-could-directly-compete-with-uber/" target="new"&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waymo says it plans to launch the service this year and has &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740141" target="new"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; "thousands" of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans for its fleet. It's testing the technology in five states and has been offering free rides in a trial program in Phoenix since early last year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Last November, Waymo sent minivans out without safety drivers to take over if the vehicle made a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The upcoming service will put the Google juggernaut into the ride-hailing business against Uber and Lyft, and with a game-changing technology advantage that neither rival has developed quite to the point Waymo has reached. Robotic taxis without drivers could slash the cost of rides for consumers and dramatically increase the scale of ride-hailing services -- if local, state and federal laws allow it and there are no collisions that raise safety alarms with the public and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740639&amp;" target="new"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; last week that self-driving cars would reduce the cost of the average ride from $2.50 per mile to $1 per mile. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Fear of Google muscling its way into the industry led Uber to hire some of Google's top automotive engineers in 2016, making the acquisition that led to Waymo and Uber's recent court battle that was &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740475" target="new"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. In 2013, the two companies had formed a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740419" target="new"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; to combine Google's cars with Uber's ride-hailing platform, but that deal died of Google's neglect, according to Uber founder Travis Kalanick. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Still, the race among the three companies is more complex than a pure rivalry. Google Ventures invested more than $250 million in Uber in 2013, Alphabet put $1 billion into Lyft last year, and Waymo won a $245 million stake in Uber in this month's settlement. Alphabet may not want to enter the ride-hailing business all over the world, given the massive resources that would take, industry analyst Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research said earlier this month. Waymo might end up part of either rival company. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Uber &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/uber-ceo-hopes-to-have-self-driving-cars-in-service-in-18-months/" target="new"&gt;hopes&lt;/a&gt; to put autonomous cars into commercial service within 18 months, and Lyft announced a self-driving ride &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16742924/lyft-nutonomy-boston-self-driving-car" target="new"&gt;pilot in Boston last year and offered &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/my-ride-in-a-self-driving-lyft-showed-how-far-autonomou-1822029612" target="new"&gt;demonstration rides&lt;/a&gt; with different partner during International CES in Las Vegas last month. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If autonomous ride services like these catch on, they may help save the environment. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, oil giant BP &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/bp-sees-self-driving-electric-vehicles-squeezing-oil-demand-by-2040.html" target="new"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that a combination of electric vehicles, shared mobility services and self-driving cars could reduce the use of oil for cars by 2040 -- or at least keep it from growing. BP's annual long-range forecast predicted the world's cars will use 18.6 billion barrels per day (bpd), down from 18.7 billion bpd in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company expects a boom in shared, autonomous vehicles in the 2030s, with most of those vehicles having electric drivetrains because they require less maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen's concept car -- I.D. Vizzion -- a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel, will debut at the 88th International Motor Show in Geneva in March.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Following the reveal of its first all-electric vehicles in the new I.D. family, the company now plans to show off, for the first time,  &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/detailpage/-/detail/World-premiere-of-the-ID-VIZZION-in-Geneva-Volkswagen-shows-the-potential-of-its-new-range-of-IDmodels/view/6263949/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da?p_p_auth=kYDRWB9n/"target="new"&gt;its concept&lt;/a&gt; for a fully autonomous car that also uses electric power.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The concept car lacks a steering wheel or visible controls, and the vehicle -- or others designed like it -- would be aimed at customer groups who cannot drive because of their age or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Vizzion is the fourth member of the Volkswagen I.D. family, and features a 111 kWh lithium-ion battery, enabling a driving range of up to 415 miles, when braking regeneration is factored in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Based on its intelligent management, the two electric motors cooperate with maximum efficiency and drive all four wheels of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At the kick-off of the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the auto manufacturer and tech giant Nvidia showcased the future of artificial intelligence in consumer vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Part of this announcement included the I.D. Buzz -- another part of the I.D. family. Volkswagen will use the Buzz as part of its electric car campaign, which will then gradually introduce autonomous driving capabilities starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One potential outcome of AI infusion into Volkswagen I.D. Buzz are what the company calls Intelligent Co-Pilot capabilities, which will include convenience and driver assistance systems based on processing sensor data from both inside and outside of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The systems can be enhanced throughout the life of the vehicle through software updates, and can gain new capabilities as further developments are made in autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to deep learning, this VW will learn to accurately assess situations and analyze the behavior of others on the road, enabling it to make the right decisions, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Building on the Nvidia Drive IX Intelligent Experience platform, AI-enabled features such as facial recognition for unlocking the vehicle from the outside, driver alerts for bicycles, gesture recognition for user controls, natural language understanding for voice control and gaze tracking for driver distraction alerts are all possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The launch of the Buzz will be followed by a new electric SUV, the I.D. Crozz. After that debut, more than 20 fully electric vehicles are planned by 2025 toward its goal of becoming the world leader in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The models based on the Modular Electrification Toolkit (MEB) architecture are planned to offer the latest driver assistance systems to be prepared for the respective levels of autonomous driving that are available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The MEB electronic systems will also be gradually introduced to vehicles with conventional drive systems that are based on the MQB (Modularer Querbaukasten -- German for Modular Transverse Matrix) architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2017/03/Autonomous_driving.html/"target="new"&gt;showed off&lt;/a&gt; its Sedric self-driving concept car, which is the first vehicle from the company to have been created for Level 5 of autonomous driving, which means a person as a human driver is no longer required.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Also designed without a steering wheel or pedals, the Sedric could point the way to future interior design cues for autonomous vehicles -- the car acts more like a lounge than a traditional four-wheeled car, with sofa-like seats, large window surfaces and transparent high-resolution OLED screen, which allows passengers to look out at the front.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Uber has brought its publicly available tool for viewing and analyzing Uber trip information to its hometown of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The tool, called &lt;a href="https://movement.uber.com/cities?lang=en-US" target="new"&gt;Uber Movement&lt;/a&gt;, provides large sets of data about the trips that Uber cars make, along with tools for crunching that data. Anyone with an Uber account can use it. It's designed to help city officials and the public study traffic trends and predict how events or changes might affect mobility around the region. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber released Movement for the San Francisco Bay Area on January 30, about a year after it was introduced. The tool is already available for at least three other cities -- Boston, Cincinnati and Washington, DC -- and the company has said it plans eventually to make it available for all cities where Uber operates. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber has been at odds with many cities since it started disrupting taxi services and transit in 2009. But the very popularity that makes Uber look like a threat to some city agencies also gives it great visibility into the day-to-day transportation experience. As a single entity providing a large percentage of the trips made in cities, Uber can uncover a lot of information about how well the road network operates. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber says Movement provides planners with better, fresher information than they can get from traditional studies, which may be years old and not as comprehensive. Plus, the data and analysis are free and easily available online, a boon to both professionals and ordinary citizens. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Movement data is anonymized so users can't see who took each trip, Uber says. Its main function is to show how long trips took between one area and another during a given time period, date range, or day of the week. For example, if a construction project blocked one lane of a street for a week, Movement could show how much that slowed down drivers who traveled through that part of the city. In some cases, trip data could even help to reveal where potholes are.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The tool is one step toward making Uber a part of cities' overall transportation systems rather than just a provider of cars for hire. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi described this ambitious goal in a speech to an investment banking conference last week. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"I want to run the bus systems for a city," Khosrowshahi said, according to &lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/14/17014762/uber-softbank-dara-khosrowshahi-goldman-sachs" target="new"&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;. He also envisions Uber trips that combine modes of transportation, such as a subway ride to a station where a car -- or a bike -- is waiting for the rider to travel the last mile to their destination. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some municipalities are already integrating ride-hailing services into their transportation plans. Five cities in central Florida now offer &lt;a href="https://www.altamonte.org/736/Uber" target="new"&gt;discounted Uber rides&lt;/a&gt; as a form of public transit. But in many places, Uber's relationship with transit is tense and competitive. To some, the multiple-passenger service UberPool looks alarmingly like a replacement for public buses. Some cities are &lt;a href=" http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/transportation/article194515734.html" target="new"&gt;borrowing&lt;/a&gt; aspects of the private ride-hailing experience to help their own services compete against companies like Uber. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Visibility systems specialist Seeva announced it has raised $2 million in seed funding to grow the company's team and continue developing its products to help autonomous vehicles perform better on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The funds included investment from Revolution's Rise of the Rest (ROTR) Seed Fund, a $150 million fund backed by high-profile investors such as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The seed round also included support from Dynamo VC, Expansion VC, Haystack VC and Trucks VC, which funds entrepreneurs building the future of transportation.

  &lt;p&gt;Seeva designs visibility systems for mobility, and its first proprietary product, SEEVAtherm, is designed to clean windshields, cameras, Lidar and other sensors to help vehicles see more safely and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Fluid can be directed anywhere on the vehicle to clear the visibility ecosystem, as well as other autonomous vehicle (AV) and advanced driver assistance (ADAS) hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2016, Seeva is a graduate of the Techstars Mobility program and is jointly headquartered in Seattle and Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"When Jere Lansinger, my co-founder and dad, retired from Chrysler after forty years as an automotive engineer, he took with him an approved list of projects he continued to tinker with into retirement," Diane Lansinger, co-founder and CEO of Seeva, said in a statement. "This is how Seeva started."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Realizing the visibility problems facing autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems, Lanhesigner created a washer fluid heating product that cleans and helps these vehicles see more safely and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company's first market-ready product, called QwikTherm, is a mechanical only system that rapidly heats up washer fluid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company's website &lt;a href="https://www.seeva.tech/our-story/"target="new"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that when the elder Lansigner found out in 2016 that two major automotive companies wanted to buy his patented washer fluid heating system, he called his daughter Diane for help launching it on the business side and developing a company around his IP portfolio of "visibility for mobility" innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"At Seeva, we're creating a trustworthy family of innovative, patent-protected products that are going to build driver and rider confidence in self-driving cars by making the hardware and software in these autonomous vehicles see the road more clearly," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As more and more cars become equipped with cameras and sensors, these systems will be essential in the development of the autonomous vehicle, and so will sensor cleaning -- to provide a good visibility in all conditions and for an infallible security, sensors must be perfectly clean.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Seeva is not the only company working in this sector. Valeo, an automotive supplier, has also proposed a full range of systems for washing optical sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company's Visibility Systems Business Group, made up of two product groups -- wiper systems and lighting systems -- designs and produces technologies to ensure the best possible visibility and safety for drivers in all weather conditions, both day and night.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The wiper systems product group develops technologies that clean windshields, rear windows and optical sensors to offer drivers and autonomous cars improved visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These solutions are designed not only for increased comfort and safety, but also reduced weight, thereby reducing CO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;German automotive parts supplier Continental has also developed cleaning systems for on-board sensors such as video cameras, radars and Lidars to keep autonomous vehicles operating safely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen Group will include WLANp -- a wireless system to link cars to each other and roadside infrastructure -- in all its cars in Europe beginning next year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The decision, &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/en/detailpage/-/detail/Volkswagen-Group-assumes-pioneering-role-in-rapid-road-safety-improvement/view/6248913/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da?p_p_auth=JV3jM91i" target="new"&gt;announced on February 15&lt;/a&gt;, might help to establish wireless LANs, rather than cellular networks, as the standard mechanism for so-called V2X, or vehicle-to-everything, communication. Automakers and regulators are weighing the two alternatives for V2X, which is expected to improve safety and traffic flow. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;VW will provide WLANp as standard equipment at no extra cost on all its personal and commercial vehicles. It says the move will help create a broad network of information on traffic risks and promote accident-free driving. Volkswagen Group is one of the largest automakers in the world, with &lt;a href="http://www.dw.com/en/volkswagen-group-achieves-record-sales-in-2017/a-42177892" target="new"&gt;2017 sales&lt;/a&gt; of 10.7 million vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;V2X can help cars "see" each other even where buildings or other vehicles block the view, including around corners and in highway passing situations. It has a range of hundreds of meters and can reach farther than the radar and Lidar systems being built into driverless cars. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If one car is about to run a red light and another is nearing the intersection at a blind corner, V2X in both cars could generate an alert -- or make either car stop, depending on how much automation was built into the cars. It could also send a signal from one car to the vehicles behind it when the brakes are applied so they can automatically slow down or generate a driver alert. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;V2X links could also help vehicles see pedestrians with mobile devices and communicate with infrastructure like traffic lights and warning signs. Wirelessly linked trucks could form convoys that roam the highways together to run more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(Think speed control to maintain a safe distance, not drivers conspiring over &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy_(song)" target="new"&gt;CB radio&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But while regulators and industry generally agree on the potential for V2X, there's less harmony over what system to use. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;WLANp is based on IEEE 802.11p, part of the standard behind WiFi. Its proponents say the technology is tested and ready to go. Regulators in both the US and Europe have used it in developing standards for future cars and infrastructure and have set aside similar frequencies for the radios to use. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has proposed requiring an 802.11p-based system called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) in all US vehicles. All these steps could help clear the way for wireless LANs to show up in all new vehicles and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But recently, some major automotive tech suppliers have started to say cellular, or C-V2X, may be the best, fastest, and most secure way to go. Cell-based systems, especially with upcoming 5G capabilities, could work better than wireless LANs and ride the massive wave of cell-chip manufacturing to low cost and wide availability, they say. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Qualcomm, which &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/qualcomm-steadfast-supporter-dsrc-sees-c-v2x-providing-clear-path-forward" target="new"&gt;already makes&lt;/a&gt; 802.11p chips, is &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/technologies/lte/advanced-pro/cellular-v2x" target="new"&gt;promoting&lt;/a&gt; C-V2X as a technology for both communication between cars (on those dedicated frequencies) and links to cellular networks. The 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), which includes Audi, BMW, Daimler and the biggest cell network suppliers, plus Qualcomm and Intel, is also pushing for this approach. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;With California and Arizona hosting advanced tests for self-driving vehicles, and Washington DC's mayor paving the way for self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles, other states are ramping up their efforts to respond to the burgeoning technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Massachusetts held a statehouse briefing on autonomous vehicles to explore the concerns and benefits of introducing self-driving vehicles to the state's roads.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Among the topics discussed were possibilities of lower emissions, increased public space and reduced traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"If you want one fact on transportation, it's this: U.S. News &amp; World report ranked us the No. 1 state in the country across all categories, including being No. 1 in education and No. 2 in health care. We were No. 45 in transportation. We have a lot of work to do," Chris Dempsey, executive director of Transportation for Massachusetts, said in remarks &lt;a href="http://www.gazettenet.com/Autonomous-vehicles-may-be-on-Mass-roads-soon-15595287/"target="new"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by the Daily Hampshire Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The embrace of self-driving vehicles would also require investment in the state's physical infrastructure, such as repairing roads and bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The February 15 meeting followed a report from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) &lt;a href="https://www.mapc.org/farechoices/"target="new"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, which found ride-hailing services such as Lyft and Uber were actually making traffic in Boston worse, as many of the people using the services would have otherwise taken public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"These transformations may become even more profound if widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles makes on-demand mobility even less expensive and more efficient," the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In January, the state's governor Charlie Baker &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-baker-creates-commission-on-the-future-of-transportation-in-the-commonwealth/"target="new"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Executive Order No. 579 establishing the commission on the Future of Transportation in the Commonwealth to advise the Baker-Polito Administration on future transportation needs and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The governor named 18 appointees to the commission, which will develop a range of scenarios anticipated between 2020 and 2040 and be used to inform the panel's findings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The commission will meet monthly and will provide a report on the analysis of members and make recommendations by December 1, of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation (MTF) President Eileen McAnneny, who will serve on the commission, said in a statement that its creation reflects MTF's recent report stressing how transportation is undergoing disruptive change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In Indiana, a state senate committee took testimony Tuesday on &lt;a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2018/bills/house/1341/"target="new"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; to regulate autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The bill proposes a series of regulations guided by oversight panels compromised of state departments of insurance and transportation leaders, and would also bar local governments from banning self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The proposed legislation has divided industry groups, with some questioning the safety of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"How are [autonomous vehicles] going to react when they come into a construction zone and you have a 180-pound man who is working a couple feet from 55 mile-an-hour traffic?" Operating Engineers Union leader Todd Vandermyd &lt;a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/industry-groups-divided-selfdriving-car-regulations-bill-140773/"target="new"&gt; questioned &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the nation's capital this week, Mayor Muriel Bowser &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740544&amp;"target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new agency that will help prepare the city, its residents as well as the streets, for autonomous vehicle testing and other developments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Interagency AV Working Group is made up of representatives from other city agencies that focus on transportation, disability rights, environmental issues and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The agency's first task is to create a proposal to test autonomous and self-driving vehicles on 10th Street, SW, near the L'Enfant Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Like a new boyfriend promising not to hurt them like the last one did, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi gave investment bankers a Valentine's Day speech on Wednesday that included everything but roses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yes, things got weird with that other guy, but I'm making everything better, he seemed to be saying. I can even be a good provider, once I get these self-driving cars and developing markets going. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Khosrowshahi confirmed what much of the world has been saying about the company, which he took over in August after a string of scandals knocked founder Travis Kalanick out of the top job and reshaped Uber's board. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We have a long way to go, but we have to re-earn our consumer and driver trust," Khosrowshahi told the Goldman Sachs Technology &amp; Internet Conference, according to &lt;a href=" https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/ubers-dara-khosrowshahi-we-have-a-long-way-to-go-to-regain-user-trust.html" target="new"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Uber had been battling charges of &lt;a href=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/21/how-one-womans-blog-post-led-to-the-fall-of-a-silicon-valley-titan/ target="new"&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/12/15/jacobs-letter-uber-spy-tactics/#435a29477f9f" target="new"&gt;spying&lt;/a&gt;, a data-breach &lt;a href=" https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-cyberattack/regulators-to-press-uber-after-it-admits-covering-up-data-breach-idUSKBN1DL2UQ" target="new"&gt;coverup&lt;/a&gt; and Kalanick just being kind of a jerk. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"It looked messy and it was messy," he said. Consumers' view of the company has been "appropriately negative," Khosrowshahi said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That's done more than make the new CEO feel bad. Uber's ride-hailing market share fell from 82% to 70% in the fourth quarter of last year, which was Khosrowshahi's first at the helm. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But in the same quarter, the nine-year-old startup also trimmed its ongoing losses, according to reports about the selected &lt;a href=https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740608&amp; target="new"&gt;financial details&lt;/a&gt; the privately held company shared on a conference call with investors on Tuesday, February 13. Uber &lt;a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/ubers-net-loss-widens-to-45-billion-for-tumultuous-2017/2018/02/14/c2372f16-11c5-11e8-a68c-e9374188170e_story.html?utm_term=.6bf3d4b6626f target="new"&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down from the $1.46 billion it shed in the last quarter of 2016. Revenue grew 65%. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company even grew while it was suffering all those embarrassments: Gross revenue for the full year rose 85% to $37 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In fact, Uber could make a profit if it stopped trying to break into less-developed markets outside the US and working on self-driving cars, Khosrowshahi said -- but it won't. Uber will keep investing in Asia, and driverless cars are the only way to eventually make rides cost $1 per mile, he said. They cost about $2.50 per mile today. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The autonomous car effort got a shot in the arm last week when the company &lt;a href=https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740475 target="new"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; a lawsuit by rival Waymo after four days in court. Uber made the $245 million deal to put the battle behind it, Khosrowshahi said, according to &lt;a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/14/uber-could-be-profitable-if-it-wants-to-says-ceo/" target="new"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "It was a very, very significant distraction for the teams that were working on our autonomous technology." &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new CEO's &lt;i&gt;mea culpa&lt;/i&gt; for Uber's sketchy past is a likely prelude to an initial public offering, which he has indicated might take place &lt;a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/new-uber-ceo-says-ipo-is-18-36-months-out/" target="new"&gt;next year&lt;/a&gt;. Big investors, including SoftBank, which &lt;a href=" https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-28/uber-investors-are-said-to-agree-to-sell-stake-in-softbank-deal" target="new"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; about 15% of Uber in late December at a discount, will eventually need to earn a return on Silicon Valley's most valuable startup. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Even if truly self-driving cars were available now, most drivers aren't ready to give up the wheel, according to an Esurance online survey of 1,057 vehicle owners in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.esurance.com/insights/technology-and-distracted-driving"target="new"&gt;The report&lt;/a&gt;, released February 14, found only 17% of surveyed drivers would sacrifice driving control to safely multi-task on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While nearly half -- 46% -- of drivers with in-car tech features say it helps their driving, 10% believe the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In fact, a quarter of respondents who sought out tech in their new vehicles reported that they have since deactivated at least one feature, and potentially helpful features like GPS navigation systems were a leading cause of driver distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In an indicator that advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) might be proving more distracting than helpful, drivers with in-car tech seemed to be slightly more distracted than those without it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The survey found 29% of drivers admit that the warning sounds themselves -- such as when the car drifts into another lane -- can be distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The survey also indicated that while most drivers recognize that using technology such as smartphones and GPS is distracting behind the wheel, they're willing to do it anyway. This is despite the admission by 10% of respondents that they have personally experienced a close call or accident caused by their own distracted driving.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Despite the fact that fatalities related to distracted driving are on the rise, this survey tells us that drivers are willing to take the risk and continue to give into the lure of using technology while driving," Stephanie Braun, director of connected cars at Esurance, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-car-technology-is-making-drivers-more-distracted-finds-esurance-300598540.html/"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nearly six in ten -- 58% -- of drivers surveyed admitted to some level of distracted driving, whether that's texting or navigating while driving, with basic tech like mobile devices as the leading cause of their distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tech distractions were followed by distractions from other drivers -- 30% -- and personal distractions like interacting with other passengers and eating -- 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The vast majority -- 91% -- of surveyed drivers said that they believe texting while driving is distracting, though more than half of those surveyed said they do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We're seeing more automakers try to address the issue of distracted driving through semi-autonomous features, but we're also mindful of the fact that some of these features could distract drivers even more and often give drivers a false sense of security," Braun added in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nearly a third -- 30% -- of respondents said they know someone who has experienced a distracted driving accident or close call.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The survey also found 30% of drivers admitted to giving in to distractions when they're too busy or are multi-tasking, and a quarter of respondents said they would pick up their phone simply because they're bored while driving.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The survey categorized drivers with car tech as owners of vehicles with warning systems such as a blind spot monitor, lane departure warning, collision warning or driver override features like lane keep, automatic emergency braking or adaptive cruise control.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition, 15 interviews were conducted in December with owners of high-tech vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Uber's latest financial results suggest the company was glad to end its expensive court battle with Waymo but is still anxious to get driverless cars on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ride-hailing giant told investors it lost $4.5 billion in 2017, according to a &lt;a href=" https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/uber-sales-reach-7-5-billion-in-2017-despite-persistent-turmoil" target="new"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; report. But excluding legal expenses and some other costs, such as stock-based compensation and taxes, the loss was only $2.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A week ago, Uber was facing a $1.8 billion trade-secrets lawsuit by Waymo in a case that set a record for packing lawyers into Judge William Alsup's federal courtroom in San Francisco. Each side had nine attorneys on hand for the &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740331" target="new"&gt;opening arguments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740475" target="new"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; reached last Thursday ended what was expected to be a three-week trial, as Uber gave Alphabet's autonomous car business a $245 million equity stake and a commitment not to use the company's trade secrets. Waymo had accused Uber of using eight stolen hardware secrets in a frantic bid to catch up in driverless cars. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars are cool, but they're also a key part of Uber's financial future, holding out the prospect of running its ride-hailing business without drivers. That would eliminate both a huge portion of Uber's costs and a part of its business that has led to controversy and legal battles. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"This war for self-driving is truly existential for Uber: we'll either start up our second S curve of growth or we'll die," Uber Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden wrote in an email to then-CEO Travis Kalanick in 2016 that was presented as evidence in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ultimate business model of the money-losing company, founded in 2009 and now worth an estimated $68 billion, may depend on driverless cars. Uber is taking in more money than ever. In last year's fourth quarter, its net revenue was $2.22 billion, up 61% from a year earlier, Bloomberg reported. Sales for the whole year reached $7.5 billion, up from about $6.5 billion in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company's losses may be narrowing. For 2016, it reported an adjusted net loss of $2.8 billion, excluding results from its China business, which was sold off in July of that year.
  Still, the company ended 2017 with less cash than it started with: $6 billion, down 13% from the end of 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Things may be looking up for Uber, which went through a dramatic and public meltdown last year over its internal culture and alleged spying practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In June, Kalanick resigned as CEO under pressure, though he remained on the company's sometimes contentious board. Dara Khosrowshahi, a former Expedia executive, took over as CEO in August. In late December, Uber sold a 15% stake to Japan's SoftBank Group, reportedly at a discount to its $68 billion valuation. And driverless cars are &lt;a href=" https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740108" target="new"&gt;on the way&lt;/a&gt;: Uber has said it plans to offer &lt;a href=" https://futurism.com/first-driverless-uber-hit-road-soon-2019/" target="new"&gt;autonomous rides&lt;/a&gt; commercially in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Luxury German car brand Mercedes took the wraps off its 2019 C-Class this week, which has inherited some semi-autonomous vehicle technology from the company's E-Class line of sedans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The C-Class, the most successful model series from Mercedes-Benz, features the company's driving assistance systems, offering the driver support and providing for a higher standard of active safety than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/vehicles/passenger-cars/c-class/"target="new"&gt;C-Class&lt;/a&gt; is able to drive semi-autonomously in certain situations and also uses map and navigation data for assistance functions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Active Distance Assist Distronic, available as part of the driving assistance package, is able to support the driver in numerous situations on the basis of map information and predictively adjust the vehicle's speed when approaching bends, junctions or roundabouts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In one instance, Distronic can maintain a safe distance to the vehicle ahead when the driver is in congested traffic by automatically maintaining a set desired speed from 12mph upwards, and also keeps a safe distance to the vehicle in front.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Other new developments include intuitive features like Active Lane Change Assist and Active Emergency Stop Assist, both of which are new functions of Active Steering Assist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Active Steering Assist helps the driver in keeping the vehicle in the center of the lane when driving on straight roads or in slight bends.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone by Mercedes' February 13 announcement, Nissan recently confirmed rumors, via &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SVNB-0FWJk/"target="new"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, that it will debut its all-new Altima midsized sedan at the 2018 New York Auto Show, which takes place at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Along with upgraded styling, the company, which has aggressively developing autonomous driving technology, is expected to include at least some self-driving or driver-assisted technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The two companies are just two examples of legacy auto manufacturers hoping to lure consumers with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Technology company Continental recently a development partner and system integrator of the collaboration between BMW, Intel and Mobileye for automated driving, while Audi is bringing what it claims is a world first to its 2019 A8 luxury sedan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Audi's Traffic Jam Pilot has been specifically &lt;a href="https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/presskits/techday-piloted-driving-9181/"target="new"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; for SAE Level 3 automated driving, which means the driver no longer has to monitor the surroundings continuously and that the vehicle system will alert the driver when he or she needs to retake control.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The system handles starting from a stop, accelerating, steering and braking in its lane, and the company claims the technology can also handle demanding situations such as vehicles cutting in closely in front.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The control signals that the Audi AI traffic jam pilot requires for conditional automated driving are obtained from the central driver assistance controller and from a redundant data fusion in the radar control unit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At the same time global automakers are investing heavily in ADAS and automated vehicle technology, the US Department of Transportation (DoT) is &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740497&amp;"target="new"&gt;gearing up to solicit feedback&lt;/a&gt; regarding regulations for self-driving vehicle technology, including a public meeting on March 1 that would seek input regarding various autonomous features and advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The DoT &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/regulations-fr/notices/2018-02738/"target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the objectives of the public meeting are primarily to get feedback on the draft AV 3.0 Framework and identify priority federal and non-federal activities that can accelerate the safe rollout of AVs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A consumer group wants the US Senate to scrap a bill that would streamline regulation for self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/sites/default/files/2018-02/LtrSenate020918.pdf"target="new"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; sent to senators on February 12, Consumer Watchdog cited so-called disengagement reports by companies testing autonomous cars in California. Those reports showed how often safety drivers had to take over the cars because their self-driving systems failed or didn't respond correctly to what was going on around them. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Congress shouldn't allow self-driving cars on the road if they can't actually drive themselves yet, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"As it stands, this piece of legislation gives self-driving car manufacturers full authority in deciding whether or not the vehicles they manufacture are prepared to roam the streets without human supervision," the letter said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sen. John Thune of South Dakota proposed the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/srpt187/CRPT-115srpt187.pdf" target="new"&gt;AV START Act&lt;/a&gt; in November. For now, the bill is stalled because three Senate Democrats, including California's Dianne Feinstein, have placed holds on it. Safety provisions are key concerns for them. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The bill would update federal vehicle rules for vehicle safety in order to help get self-driving cars on the road. After three years, it would allow the US Department of Transportation to give exemptions for up to 80,000 autonomous vehicles per manufacturer. The bill would require manufacturers to submit safety reports, but based on a voluntary safety assessment proposed by the Department of Transportation. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The act is also intended to keep autonomous car regulation from becoming a mishmash of different state laws while the DoT formulates new federal rules. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Consumer Watchdog says the AV START Act wouldn't create meaningful regulation or a way to verify that self-driving cars actually work. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740229" target="new"&gt;2017 reports&lt;/a&gt; from California, which allow autonomous vehicle testing but require companies to report things like accidents and test-driver interventions, showed all companies that tested cars ran into cases where safety drivers had to take over. Twenty companies filed reports. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waymo's cars &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/42aff875-7ab1-4115-a72a-97f6f24b23cc/Waymofull.pdf?MOD=AJPERES" target="new"&gt;went furthest&lt;/a&gt; without human intervention, going an average of 5,596 miles before a driver had to take over. The automotive arm of Google parent Alphabet reported 63 incidents in 352,545 miles. In testing by most other companies, the cars went only a few hundred miles between incidents. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Drivers had to take over because the cars executed unwanted maneuvers, incorrectly predicted what other drivers and pedestrians would do, didn't perceive their surroundings correctly, or lost their GPS signals, among other things. In some cases, the self-driving cars appeared headed for a collision when the driver intervened. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;California hasn't yet allowed cars to hit public streets without a safety driver, though it has drafted rules that might allow it. But in Arizona, where regulation is more lax, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; has tested truly driverless cars on public roads and plans to launch a driverless ride-hailing service this year. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Cities, states and the federal government are all looking to regulate aspects of autonomous vehicles. On Tuesday, Washington, DC, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740544&amp;" target="new"&gt;launched an effort&lt;/a&gt; to get self-driving tests going in some parts of the district. Indiana lawmakers are currently &lt;a href="http://wbaa.org/post/industry-groups-divided-self-driving-car-regulations-bill#stream/0" target="new"&gt;considering&lt;/a&gt; a state law that would supersede tighter local restrictions. But the DoT and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) traditionally have taken the lead in regulating vehicles in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Congress is trying to catch up with the growth of autonomous cars. Last September, the House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving/u-s-house-unanimously-approves-sweeping-self-driving-car-measure-idUSKCN1BH2B2" target="new"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; a bill similar to the AV START Act that would let manufacturers deploy as many as 25,000 cars without meeting current safety standards in the first year, rising to 100,000 after three years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has indicated the president supports the bills. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles are going to get presidential treatment in Washington DC as the city's mayor is paving the way to embrace these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On Monday, February 12, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a new agency that will help prepare the city, its residents as well as the streets, for autonomous vehicle testing and other developments. The Interagency AV Working Group is made up of representatives from other city agencies that focus on transportation, disability rights, environmental issues and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The agency's first task is to create a proposal to test autonomous and self-driving vehicles on 10th Street, SW, near the L'Enfant Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We will keep the District on the cutting edge of autonomous vehicles and do so in a way that benefits our residents," said Mayor Bowser in a &lt;a href="https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-establishes-autonomous-vehicle-working-group"target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Washington, DC is a creative, tech-savvy city, and as we grow, we will always be exploring and investing in innovation and finding ways to make it more inclusive."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new agency is also working with the city's Southwest Business Improvement District, which works to improve and maintain about 483 acres within the southwest part of Washington, &lt;a href="https://www.swbid.org/"target="new"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If the city's proposal is accepted, the autonomous vehicle program would run along 10th Street, which connects the National Mall via Independence Avenue and Banneker Park to The Wharf, according to the mayor's office. The street sits above Interstate 395 and about 4,300 cars travel it each day, which would be enough to test autonomous vehicles in real-life traffic situations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The first step in this process is a Request for Information (RFI), which asks for information and input from autonomous vehicle providers and other technology companies. &lt;a href="https://www.swbid.org/avrfi"target="new"&gt;The RFI also offers a look&lt;/a&gt; at where proposed testing route is located.

  &lt;p&gt;Washington's elected officials began exploring autonomous vehicle technology in 2017, and Bowser recently traveled to Silicon Valley to pitch the city as a test area for the technology. If approved, it would make the District one of the few Northeast cities testing autonomous technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Right now, most self-driving and autonomous vehicle testing is conducted in the Western US, in Nevada, Arizona and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=739968"target="new"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, which is near where these technologies are being developed in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. However, other metropolises are starting to jump into the game, notably Pittsburgh, which is home to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740108"target="new"&gt;Uber's self-driving development team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The surprise settlement of Waymo's trade-secrets lawsuit against Uber last week may have saved both companies from the harsh glare of the spotlight, but it probably won't determine who supplies your first driverless ride.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740331" target="new"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Uber of using its trade secrets to develop Lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars and sought as much as $1.8 billion in damages. But last Friday, the companies announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740475&amp;" target="new"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; in which Waymo will get a small stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, and a commitment from the ride-hailing giant not to use Waymo's confidential hardware or software. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The settlement, which the companies reached late on February 8 after only four days in court, ended a trial that was expected to last three weeks. A federal jury and a media throng had already heard unsettling tales of take-no-prisoners culture that Uber is trying to put behind it. Waymo ran the risk, like any litigant, of losing its case. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The deal may allow the companies to take another shot at a partnership they had discussed several times since 2013: Waymo -- then known as Google's Project Chauffeur -- had driverless cars, and Uber had a popular ride-hailing service. When the planned partnership never actually took shape, Uber started developing its own autonomous technology and the two companies ended up on a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740419" target="new"&gt;collision course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But this wasn't a clash between full-fledged rivals in a mature business, like the years-long smartphone litigation between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co." target="new"&gt;Apple and Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. So far, the self-driving car industry is essentially a set of experiments. That's why all eyes are on the basic technologies -- for now. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Early on, it's going to be about technology leadership. But later on, it's going to be about business models and supply chains," said Bob O'Donnell, president of market research and consulting firm Technalysis Research. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If Uber was using stolen Waymo designs -- which Uber denies -- the settlement may cost the company some time in its quest to make cars drive themselves, which ultimately affects its bottom line and market value, O'Donnell said. "The entire business model of Uber is based on the fact that eventually they aren't going to have to pay anybody." &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But by 2030, when various forecasts predict autonomous cars will perform &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/25-of-u-s-driving-could-be-done-by-self-driving-cars-by-2030-study-finds/" target="new"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; of our trips – as much as &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/rethinkx-selfdriving-electric-cars-will-dominate-roads-by-2030" target="new"&gt;95%&lt;/a&gt; of all miles driven – last week's settlement may be a nothing more than a footnote. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"It's important now, but in 12 years, the market dynamics will also have changed a lot," O'Donnell said. The sky's the limit on what could happen by then. Uber might have acquired Waymo, or vice versa. And everyone in today's car business, including both automakers and component suppliers like Bosch and Continental, is looking for a piece of the business. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"There's not going to be one winner. Even if Waymo has a head start now, that's not the end of the story," O'Donnell said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What's more, all the winners will need partners to succeed. The whole car industry is a complex web of manufacturers and suppliers. Even Tesla relies on third parties for some of its technology. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There's a good chance Waymo will eventually be a technology supplier to Uber, Lyft -- where it's already invested $1 billion -- and other mobility providers, O'Donnell said. Just because Waymo will soon be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740141" target="new"&gt;pick you up&lt;/a&gt; in a driverless SUV in a few cities doesn't mean it wants to break into the ride-hailing business for good. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What may seem like an epic battle for the streets in a San Francisco courtroom is really a fringe fight to most consumers, O'Donnell said. "There's the Silicon Valley view of the world, and then there's the actual world."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A Technalysis survey of 1,000 US consumers last year found that 57% had never used a ride-hailing service and another 23% had only done it once or twice. So what was imminently at stake here wasn't personal transportation in the suburbs and midsized cities of America. It was reputation, the most valuable commodity in Silicon Valley -- after coding skills and a killer funding round.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Transportation (DOT) is to hold a public meeting on March 1 that would seek input towards a planned document regarding automated vehicles, with stakeholders including auto manufacturers set to  attend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The document, Automated Vehicles (AV) 3.0, will provide a framework for automation in the surface transportation system and describe the department's approach to the safe rollout of self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;DOT representatives have said the objectives of the public meeting are primarily to get feedback on the draft AV 3.0 Framework and identify priority federal and non-federal activities that can accelerate the safe rollout of AVs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The public meeting will be an open listening session to provide as great an opportunity for comment as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The announcement &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/regulations-fr/notices/2018-02738/"target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; all comments provided during the meeting would be oral and all written comments and presentations should be submitted to the docket for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In September, the DOT and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety/"target="new"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;  federal guidance for Automated Driving Systems (ADS).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The guidance focuses on SAE International Levels of Automation 3-5 ADS, which includes conditional, high and full automation, and clarifies the guidance process, revises unnecessary design elements from the safety self-assessment and aligns federal guidance with the latest developments and industry terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With conditional automation, a driver is a necessity but is not required to monitor the environment -- however the driver must be ready to take control of the vehicle at all times upon notice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;High automation means the vehicle is capable of performing all driving functions under certain conditions, and under full automation, the vehicle is capable of all driving functions in all conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Over the coming months and years, NHTSA, along with other federal agencies including the DOT and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), will continue to provide guidance and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Public trust and confidence in the evolution of [automated vehicles] has the potential to advance or inhibit the testing and deployment of them on public roadways," the report concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Alphabet, with it self-driving car project Waymo, and General Motors, the twin titans of autonomous vehicles, were the top performing companies for vehicle testing, according to automaker &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/disengagement_report_2017"target="new"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; submitted to California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of its regulations, California requires companies testing its self-driving vehicles on public roads to submit a report on the year's test results, including disengagements, or incidents when a human operator had to manually take over the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Despite the public advances of advanced drive assisted driving (ADAS) systems and the high-profile cross-country self-driving vehicle trials, some in the industry are skeptical as to how soon fully autonomous vehicles are a common presence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some industry experts and analysts argue it will be at least a decade before the testing phase of the technology is complete and autonomous vehicles become widespread.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition, the public is still not sold on the safety of autonomous vehicles, according to a January survey commissioned by the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://saferoads.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AV-Poll-Report-January-2018-FINAL.pdf"target="new"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; found a majority (63%) would not support "mass exemptions" from federal motor vehicle safety standards for self-driving cars, and overwhelmingly support (75%) the DOT developing new standards related to driverless vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers are curious about autonomous commercial vehicles --everything from long haul trucks to factory floor forklifts -- but are so far taking a wait-and-see approach.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This was the finding of a PwC and The Manufacturing Institute (MI) survey of 128 large and midsized American manufacturers and transportation companies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nearly 60% of manufacturers surveyed cited cost as one of the top barriers to adoption of semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles within their plants, followed by immature technology (42%) and safety issues (32%).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While only 9% of manufacturers have adopted some type of semi-autonomous or autonomous mobility within their operations, the &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/industrial-products/library/industrial-mobility.html"target="new"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; indicated another 10% are expecting to do so in the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The report also revealed US investments in private mobility companies totaled $6.8 billion for mobility startups between 2012 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"I think the technology to support autonomous long-haul trucking technology will approach maturity in the next five to ten years," Greg Roger, policy analyst at the Eno Center for Transportation told PwC in an interview included in the report. "However, we're still 10 to 20 years off from having fully driverless trucks from being a common sight on the roads."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Roger added that he thought the fear of displacing human workers and the general public's initial safety concerns will keep drivers in the trucks for at least another decade or two into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While there are also concerns that autonomous trucks represent a threat to jobs in the same way automation in general has some economists worried, an Uber &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@UberATG/the-future-of-trucking-b3d2ea0d2db9/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; suggests self-driving commercial vehicles could actually be a boost to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The survey cites a &lt;a href="http://www.trucking.org/ATA%20Docs/News%20and%20Information/Reports%20Trends%20and%20Statistics/10%206%2015%20ATAs%20Driver%20Shortage%20Report%202015.pdf"target="new"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the American Trucking Associations, which estimates that over the next decade, more than 400,000 of today's drivers will retire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Over that same time period, the ATA predicts that demand for freight will increase by 37%.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The report projected that if the industry continues down its current path, approximately 900,000 new drivers will be needed to keep up with future demand.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Autonomous commercial trucks could eventually have a positive impact on the driver shortage, but we are still years away from truly driverless Class 8 trucks running on the highway as a normal part of the industry," the ATA report noted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Uber report noted the biggest technical hurdles for self-driving trucks are driving on tight and crowded city streets, backing into complex loading docks, and navigating through busy facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Embark Technology, a startup developing self-driving trucks, announced it had completed a coast-to-coast, 2,400-mile journey from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Fla., test drive with a semi-autonomous truck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Despite some high-profile successes, a 2017 J.D. Power &lt;a href="http://www.jdpower.com/cars/articles/jd-power-studies/2017-us-tech-choice-study-results/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; indicates Americans have only grown more skeptical of the safety of autonomous vehicles as they've evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Excepting only Gen Y -- those born 1977-1994 -- all other generational groups have grown more skeptical of self-driving car technology, according to the firm's 2017 U.S. Tech Choice Study, a finding that could indicate a new challenge to car manufacturers and technology developers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Following a week of courtroom testimony that laid bare the sometimes cutthroat process of bringing driverless vehicles to the world's roadways, Waymo and Uber announced a stunning settlement of their patent dispute on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Waymo, which is the autonomous car division that Google spun out several years ago, agreed to settle its dispute against the ride-sharing giant in exchange for a $245 million stake in Uber, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/09/uber-waymo-lawsuit-settlement.html"target="new"&gt;according to several media reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The deal, which both companies announced February 9 inside the courtroom of Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco, means that Waymo now owns a 0.34% stake in Uber, which is valued at about $72 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/stunner-google-and-uber-settle-1518191623-21a40f85-0a9c-400c-99b6-67282eebd75d.html"target="new"&gt;according to Axios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber also pledged not to incorporate any of Waymo's trade secrets into its own plans to build fleets of autonomous cars for its ride-sharing services.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At the heart of the dispute between the two companies was the fate of former &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740419&amp;"target="new"&gt;Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski&lt;/a&gt;, who was seen as instrumental in developing the Lidar systems that would help these autonomous vehicles maneuver through city streets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After leaving Waymo, Levandowski founded the company Otto, which was then bought by Uber. Waymo, and its parent company Alphabet, charged that Uber only bought the company to gain access to Levandowski and his knowledge of Lidar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Waymo said the former employee downloaded thousands of files before he left, and that intellectual property belonged to the company, not him personally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waymo originally sought $1.8 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The first week of the trial saw testimony by several luminaries from Silicon Valley, including Uber founder Travis Kalanick, who was leading the company when the dispute began. The testimony also showed how brutal the behind-the-scenes race has become to move self-driving out of the test phase and into the commercial world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That curtain closed on Friday, when Uber and Waymo announced their agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-waymo-settlement/"target="new"&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt;, current Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi noted that the company could have handled the Otto acquisition better, but that the agreement would mean Waymo and Uber would be partners and competitors going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"To be clear, while we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymo's proprietary information in its self-driving technology, we are taking steps with Waymo to ensure our Lidar and software represents just our good work," Khosrowshahi wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Waymo statement struck a similar tone, according to Axios.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We have always believed competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads and we look forward to bringing fully self-driving cars to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Embark Technology, a startup developing self-driving trucks, announced it had completed a coast-to-coast, 2,400-mile journey from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Fla., test drive with a semi-autonomous truck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company is in a three-way partnership with the truck-leasing company Ryder and the appliance giant Electrolux, known best for its line of Frigidaire appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Embark has taken an existing truck and equipped it with a series of sensors and software, to navigate stretches of highway, but would still require human drivers to enter and exit highways and drive on city streets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The cross-country trek, first &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/embarks-self-driving-truck-drove-2400-miles-across-the-u-s/"target="new"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by TechCrunch, took five days, which the company said it thinks it could get down to two days.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;During the entirety of the test a human driver was seated behind the wheel at all times to take control of the truck if necessary, though company CEO Alex Rodrigues told TechCrunch the truck was drive autonomously for "the vast majority" of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Embark started delivering refrigerators along a 650-mile stretch of Interstate 10 from El Paso, Texas, to Ontario, Calif., in October.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Those trucks were driven with Level 2 automation, a federal standard that denotes the ability of the vehicle to steer itself as well as accelerate and brake under normal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A driver is required to pay attention to the road at all times and take control if the system is unable to navigate a hazard, and the driver is in the driver's seat at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We are trying to get self-driving technology out on the road as fast as possible," Rodrigues &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/self-driving-trucks.html" target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The New York Times in November. "Trucking needs self-driving and self-driving needs trucking."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In a promotional video on the company's &lt;a href="http://embarktrucks.com/"target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, Rodrigues said Embark is planning on additional testing on new freight routes in the near future as it continues to test out the system and prepare for a market launch.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;According to a January &lt;a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/13-industries-disrupted-driverless-cars/"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from CB Insights, driverless automobiles will reduce demand for truckers, taxi drivers and other driving professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Instead, telematics technology -- the use of telecommunications to facilitate communication and gather data from vehicles -- will allow taxi and trucking companies to manage their self-driving fleets so that they provide services and run their routes with optimal efficiency, but humans will still be needed to manage these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Driverless trucks are being used to &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-18/rio-tinto-opens-worlds-first-automated-mine/6863814" target="new"&gt;move iron ore at mines in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and the Canadian energy company Suncor Energy is &lt;a href=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/autonomous-trucks-could-transform-labour-market-eliminate-driver-jobs/article25715184/ target="new"&gt;working to automate its own trucks&lt;/a&gt; in a process its CFO estimates will take 800 human drivers off its drilling site.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Max Fuller, executive chairman of US Xpress, the fourth-largest trucking company in the US, told &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/"target="new"&gt;Trucks.com&lt;/a&gt; in July 2017 that he believes long-haul trucks will have Level 4 autonomous capability in three to four years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We're trying to enhance the safety, give [drivers] the ability to be more productive, try to create a better return for the company and supply a better service for our customers," he said. "Our number one goal is to create jobs that people want and that's the reason we need products that make the job a lot simpler for drivers."&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In order for assisted driving to work, vehicles have to collect and process -- on-the-fly -- all kinds of data about the world around them, especially where precisely other objects are at any given moment and how fast they are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That kind of precision and, especially, low-latency can only be achieved with the new 5G technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;LTE 4G is already in use by several manufacturers for non-safety critical &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/vehicle-vehicle-communication"target="new"&gt;vehicle-to-vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) applications, such as exchanging, critical but not time sensitive information including weather, road conditions and traffic data directly between vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, only the arrival of 5G, offering latencies as low as 1 millisecond, will challenge the car industry's dedicated short-range V2X technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is where Huawei, along with Telefonica come in. Together, the two companies, &lt;a href="https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/press-office/-/telefonica-and-huawei-complete-world-s-first-proof-of-concept-test-of-5g-v2x-radio-for-urllc-assisted-driving"target="new"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt; that they have created the first proof-of-concept (PoC) testbed that can connect two vehicles on a 5G-based V2X network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To perform the test Huawei and Telefonica used the 3GPP Release 14 New Radio (NR), which was approved in December, along with non-standalone (NSA) &lt;a href="http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1930-sys_architecture"target="new"&gt;5G specifications&lt;/a&gt;. A standalone standard (Release 15) for 5G is expected this June.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The so-called &lt;a href="https://www.comsoc.org/netmag/cfp/5g-ultra-reliable-low-latency-communications"target="new"&gt;Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication&lt;/a&gt; (URLLC) mode for 5G NR offers the possibility to support services with low latency and high reliability requirements. In this PoC test, it was demonstrated that URLLC can effectively support V2X with higher system capacity and better coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the main applications will be platooning, where the platoon members are controlled by the 5G NR network. In this case scenario, the Huawei and Telefonica teams have achieved 99.99 % reliability within a 1 millisecond delay constraint, and decreased signaling overhead by 67% compared with current cellular systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Applications of the 5G-V2X services include extended sensors, advance driving and remote parking, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;5G networks offer a new level of connectivity for vehicle communications, supporting advanced use cases, such as high-throughput sensor data/map sharing among vehicles; see-through capabilities streaming camera information from one car to another; and wideband ranging for improved positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To achieve full autonomous driving, the industry is planning to develop 5G radio specifications, as well as new NR Sidelink, which will help enable full, V2V communications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We are pleased with our further collaboration with Telefónica in 5G technologies," said Wen Tong, CTO of Huawei Wireless and a Huawei Fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The 5G-V2X PoC is another joint effort to pave the way for commercialization of 5G and lay a solid foundation to realize the 5G vision of enabling cooperative autonomous driving," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;5G, with its ability to offer Gigabit speeds, ultra-reliable low latency communication, as well as a massive number of nodes, will support the platform for the next generation of always connected vehicles of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The world's premier electric car company -- Tesla -- is getting in on the trend for cross-country automated vehicle adventures, following coast-to-coast excursions by commercial trucks and passenger cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;During a fourth-quarter earnings call on February 7, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla was planning to embark on a road trip across the US in a self-driving car within three to six months.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company had previously announced plans for a coast-to-coast autonomous trek last year with a planned drive from Los Angeles to New York in a self-driving Model S or Model X.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The upcoming autonomous coast-to-coast drive will showcase a major leap forward for our self-driving technology," Musk wrote in a &lt;a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/5975320007x0x970775/34923C55-6853-4223-ADDA-CB3CDC1B919F/TSLA_Update_Letter_2017-4Q.pdf"target="new"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;. "Additionally, an extensive overhaul of the underlying architecture of our software has now been completed, which has enabled a step-change improvement in the collection and analysis of data and fundamentally enhanced its machine-learning capabilities."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Musk also noted in the letter that the company's neural network, which expands as Tesla's customer fleet grows, is able to collect and analyze more high-quality data than ever before, which will allow the company to rollout a series of new Autopilot features in 2018 and in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Embark Technology, a startup developing self-driving trucks, announced it had completed a coast-to-coast, 2,400-mile journey from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Fla. test drive with a semi-autonomous truck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The cross-country trek, part of a three-way partnership with the truck-leasing company Ryder and the appliance giant Electrolux, took five days, which the company said it thinks it could get down to two days.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tesla, which has produced multiple models of electric vehicles for consumers, first announced plans to develop electric trucks in 2016, and Reuters &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-truck-autonomous/exclusive-tesla-developing-self-driving-tech-for-semi-truck-wants-to-test-in-nevada-idUSKBN1AP2GD"target="new"&gt;recently obtained&lt;/a&gt; a document showing correspondence between Tesla and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles discussing road tests for a prototype long-haul autonomous vehicle truck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 2015, automotive technology specialist Delphi's autonomous Audi arrived in New York City, nine days, 15 states, and 3,400 miles after leaving San Francisco -- company officials said the vehicle was in fully automated mode for 99% of the drive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On the other side of the world, Nissan &lt;a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-2f7966f516e271fc4ea0f79a9a005a1a-171205-01-e/"target="new"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to have its fully automated ride service on the road in Japan by the early 2020s -- the plan is to start with a "public field test" for the Easy Ride service in Yokohama.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The public field test will take place in the Minatomirai district of Yokohama from March 5 to March 18.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Despite the public advances of advanced drive assisted driving (ADAS) systems and the high-profile cross-country self-driving vehicle trials, some in the industry are skeptical as to how soon fully autonomous vehicles are a common presence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Speaking at this week's Nissan Futures technology symposium in Singapore, Niels De Boer, program director at the Centre of Excellence For Testing and Research of Autonomous Vehicles at Nanyang Technological University, told Motoring that companies need to be "realistic" about their timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"You make bold statements, but you really need to ask what do you mean by autonomous driving?" he &lt;a href="https://www.motoring.com.au/autonomous-cars-decades-away-says-nissan-110983/"target="new"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;. "Because a lot of these statements are made but they don’t talk about the level of maturity."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;De Boer said he doesn't think widespread use of fully autonomous vehicle networks for another half century.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Uber repeatedly tried to partner with Google for years before the companies ended up as fierce rivals for the future of autonomous cars, Uber founder Travis Kalanick told a jury in San Francisco on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As early as 2013, Uber talked to Google about pairing its ride-hailing prowess with the larger company's self-driving car technology, Kalanick said. But over time, it proved hard to get the attention of his contact, Google co-founder Larry Page.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tension grew as the two companies' car projects started to overlap. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"It was kind of like a little brother with a big brother," Kalanick said of the companies' relationship. He testified Wednesday morning on the third day of a trade-secrets trial between Uber and Waymo -- the company that grew out of Google's self-driving car effort. Waymo has accused Uber of stealing eight key pieces of its intellectual property by acquiring a startup founded by former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski. The self-driving car company, a division of Google parent Alphabet, is seeking $1.8 billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTEDYCkNqns target="new"&gt;sometimes hot-headed&lt;/a&gt; Kalanick seemed calm and mostly at ease as he answered questions on the stand for nearly two hours on February 7, his second and last day of testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Late in the summer of 2013, Google invited Uber to work with its autonomous car project, Kalanick said. Google picked him up in one of its early self-driving cars. "I'm like 'That's pretty cool,'" Kalanick recalled. But Google wasn't willing to give as much time to the partnership as Uber wanted, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So starting in early 2015, Uber began to hire dozens of engineers from the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh to launch its own self-driving project. That got Google's attention. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Larry was very upset with us about us acquiring the CMU team and starting the autonomy effort ourselves," Kalanick said. "He was a little angry and said, 'Why are you doing my thing?'" Put another way, "Generally, Google was super unhappy, unpumped, about us doing this," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Those hirings gave Uber an advantage over Google that only grew after Uber attracted Levandowski and other Google employees, Uber's lawyers have argued. They say Waymo is suing because it can't keep up. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kalanick had a phone call with Page in October 2016, after Uber acquired of Levandowski's startup, called Otto. He said Page complained, "You're taking our people. You're taking our IP." Kalanick said he told Page that Uber had a process to make sure it wasn't stealing Google's intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Under questioning from an attorney for Uber, Karen Dunn of the firm Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, Kalanick said Uber hired Levandowski in 2016 for his brains, not trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We hired Anthony because we felt that he was incredibly visionary, a very good technologist, and he was also very charming," Kalanick said. For one thing, Levandowski had a vision of what autonomous ride-hailing fleets could mean for cities of the future. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kalanick also testified that Lidar, the laser-based vision system used in both Google's and Uber's vehicles, was only part of what Uber was seeking when it acquired Otto for $592 million. Waymo has said its former employee took its secret Lidar designs to Uber, which then duplicated them. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Under questioning by Waymo's attorney, Charles Verhoeven of Quinn Emmanuel, Kalanick admitted that he went ahead with the Otto acquisition knowing Waymo might sue alleging intellectual-property theft.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At Levandowski's request, Uber eventually agreed to indemnify him against such a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He also admitted that he never read a due-diligence report that Uber ordered from a forensics firm to ensure it didn't receive any trade secrets through the acquisition. Kalanick said he signs hundreds of documents every day and doesn't have time to read everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pP
  Kalanick's testimony on Wednesday shed light on Silicon Valley's rough-and-tumble culture through the eyes of one of its most legendary -- or notorious -- executives. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waymo's Verhoeven questioned Kalanick over many texts he exchanged with Levandowski in the months leading up to the Otto acquisition. One text from Levandowski simply said, "Burn the village." Another Uber executive's notes from a meeting showed Kalanick saying, "The golden time is over. It is war time." Asked about this quote, he told Verhoeven, "It sounds like something I would say." &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another text that Levandowski sent as Uber considered acquiring his company said, "Here's the speech you need to give," followed by a "wink" emoji and a YouTube link to the &lt;a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVxYOQS6ggk target="new"&gt;"greed is good"&lt;/a&gt; monologue from the 1987 film &lt;i&gt;Wall Street&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tech slang is also playing a role in the case. Notes from one Uber meeting showed Kalanick saying the company should get "cheat codes" for self-driving technology. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Verhoeven characterized "cheat codes" as codes designed to allow gamers to advance to the next level without earning points through the game to get there. But at one point in court, Kalanick defined the term another way, as anything that lets someone avoid a task or investment. He said one example of a "cheat code" might be Uber collecting real-time motion data from its cars as they stop and start at traffic lights. In aggregate, that data could allow Uber to tell what lights were red or green all across a city without having to install cameras to watch the lights. The data could be used for route planning and other applications. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The trial before Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco continues Thursday and is expected to last about three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler and Bosch, the world's largest auto parts supplier, told a German car publication that the two companies are partnering on a self-driving taxi that would begin testing themselves on city streets in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"There will be test vehicles on the streets in the coming months," Bosch chief executive Volkmar Denner &lt;a href="ahttps://www.automobilwoche.de/article/20180203/BCONLINE/180209967/exklusiv--kooperation-mit-bosch-daimler-will-als-erster-konzern-robotaxis-anbieten"target="new"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the publication.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Dennner didn't elaborate as to what cities or under what conditions the vehicles will be tested, but the company does possess experience in this field, having conducted self-driving truck tests in Nevada in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Apart from highly autonomous level 3 vehicles, we will also bring fully autonomous vehicles -- level 4/5 -- to the streets in the foreseeable future," Wilko Stark, vice president Daimler and Mercedes-Benz Cars strategy, told Automobilwoche.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Level 4 vehicles are "designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip" according to a US Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/AV/federal-automated-vehicles-policy-september-2016"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It's important to note, however, that Level 4 vehicle autonomous capabilities are limited to the "operational design domain (ODD)" of the vehicle -- meaning it does not cover every driving scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A Level 5 vehicle is one that can match a human driver in every driving scenario, including extreme environments like dirt roads.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Daimler's Stark also noted the partnership with Bosch was running smoothly and the company was planning to offer mobility services with their own robotaxis as soon as possible, noting platforms for these services such as Mytaxi, Via and Moovel already exist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The big difference to other competitors is that we are conceptualizing our vehicle as a robotaxi right from the beginning and not as a technology-kit mounted on a production vehicle," Stark explained. "We are not building a makeshift solution."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Daimler, the world's largest luxury automaker, will have to keep the pressure up if it wants to stay in competition with the likes of rivals like BMW, which has promised to deliver at Level 5 self-driving vehicle to market by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Elmar Frickenstein, the Bavarian company’s senior vice president for autonomous driving, was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bmw-autonomous-self-driving/bmw-says-self-driving-car-to-be-level-5-capable-by-2021-idUSKBN16N1Y2"target="new"&gt;reported as saying&lt;/a&gt; during a panel discussion in Berlin in March 2017 that the company was in fact working on Level 3, 4 and 5 types of vehicles to be ready for 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A year before the public announcement, BMW had teamed up with Intel and Mobileye, an Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving specialist, to develop an open platform for the next generation of cars, from door locks to data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the US, Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740141"target="new"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; thousands of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to expand its ever-growing autonomous vehicle fleet, and are due to arrive later this year when the company expands its autonomous ride-sharing service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Japan's automakers are under &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/japan-aims-to-show-off-autonomous-vehicles-at-2020-summerolympics/article36971226/"target="new"&gt;even greater&lt;/a&gt; pressure, with the government pushing for a 2020 Summer Olympics deadline to wow an international crowd of sports fans with a fleet of autonomous vehicles shuttling athletes, organizers and VIPs around Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Even among eccentric tech executives, Tesla CEO and Chief Designer Elon Musk stands out. On Tuesday, while Waymo and Uber spent another day squabbling over alleged theft of trade secrets, Musk took the high road -- 400 million miles high, eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A test launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket designed and built by SpaceX, Musk's aerospace startup, carried the Tesla founder's personal Tesla Roadster out beyond the bonds of Earth to eventually orbit around the sun. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The sports car in Midnight Cherry, an example of the electric car maker's first model, made from 2008 to 2012, isn't quite driverless: It's carrying a space-suited dummy named Starman, in a pleasure-driving pose with one arm resting on top of the convertible's door. (The space suit is SpaceX's own design.) But if the journey goes as planned, the car will find its way around the sun and past Earth and Mars, as long as the hardware and the laws of physics last.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Its estimated range of 200 miles on a charge only applies on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On board the car is also a toy Roadster with its own tiny astronaut, as well as an optical storage device containing Isaac Asimov's &lt;i&gt;Foundation&lt;/i&gt; trilogy of sci-fi novels and a plaque with the names of more than 6,000 SpaceX employees, SpaceX said during a YouTube &lt;a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c target="new"&gt;livestream&lt;/a&gt; of the launch. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;SpaceX is streaming &lt;a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXxyXggQenJM" target="new"&gt;live views&lt;/a&gt; of the Roadster online.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Roadster isn't the first electric car to leave Earth, as &lt;a href=https://www.space.com/39606-spacex-falcon-heavy-fourth-car-space.html target="new"&gt;Space.com&lt;/a&gt; points out. The three lunar rovers used on NASA's Apollo missions got there first. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the February 6 test launch is to find out how the Falcon Heavy performs. Every rocket needs a payload for realistic testing, and usually it's just a block of cement or some other weighty object that can be placed where the crew or cargo would go. Musk, who no doubt is getting ready to replace his Roadster with one from the &lt;a href=https://www.tesla.com/roadster target="new"&gt;new batch&lt;/a&gt; due in 2020 anyway, is just using a payload with a bit more flair. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The car's svelte 2,700-pound curb weight doesn't even begin to simulate all that the Falcon Heavy can carry. It's powerful enough to lift nearly 64 metric tons, or the weight of a fully loaded Boeing 737, into orbit, according to SpaceX. Only the Saturn V, used for the Apollo moon missions in the 1960s and 1970s, has had a greater carrying capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SpaceX calls the Falcon Heavy the most powerful operational rocket in the world, with more than 5 million pounds of thrust at lift-off, equal to the power of 18 Boeing 747s. Its three rocket cores contain 27 engines. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Falcon Heavy took off from Launch Complex 39A NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral, Fla., the same launchpad the Saturn V used. But unlike the classic NASA rocket, the Falcon Heavy sent at least two of its giant lower stages back to Earth. Those two stages had come back from earlier SpaceX launches and returned together to their designated landing pads to be reused again. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another stage of the rocket was designed to land on an autonomous barge off the Florida coast. It wasn't clear late Monday whether that maneuver had worked. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;SpaceX built the Falcon Heavy so it could launch bigger satellites and future manned spacecraft. It has already launched multiple supply missions to the International Space Station. Musk's goal is to eventually mount a mission to Mars. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The roadster's trip, which will take it as far as 400 million  kilometers away from Earth at speeds up to 40,000km per hour, may last a billion years, SpaceX says. By then, everyone who pre-ordered a Tesla Model 3 may actually have their cars. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Nvidia and automotive technology specialist Continental have teamed up to build an advanced self-driving vehicle systems based on the chipmaker's Xavier Drive platform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The collaboration will result in an artificial intelligence (AI) system that will offer support for autonomous vehicles spanning in complexity from Level 2 -- basic driver assistance features -- to Level 5, where the vehicle has no steering wheel or pedals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The two companies will focus initially on highly automated driving features, and 360-degree perception and automatic lane changing on highways, including the ability to merge in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The system will also integrate high-definition maps and provide updates that will enable vehicles to localize themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Drive platform includes the Xavier system-on-a-chip (SoC), as well as the Nvidia's Drive operating system and Drive AV (autonomous vehicle) software stacks.&lt;/P&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These Nvidia technologies will then integrate a range of Continental sensors, including radar, camera and high-resolution 3D Lidar.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Continental also specializes in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), integrating multi-function cameras, fish-eye cameras with surround view and central control units for assisted and automated driving.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Partnering with Nvidia will enable Continental to advance beyond its leadership position in advanced driver assistance systems, delivering a scalable range of automated and autonomous vehicle systems, from today's requirements up to Level 5," Luca De Ambroggi, an analyst with IHS Markit, wrote in a February 5 statement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The planned market introduction in 2021 aligns with German luxury automaker BMW's plans to introduce fully self-driving cars to the market that same year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The complexity of autonomous driving requires nothing less than the full computational horsepower of an AI supercomputer," Dr. Elmar Degenhart, CEO of Continental, &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/continental-and-nvidia-partner-to-enable-worldwide-production-of-ai-self-driving-cars"target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. "Together with the performance and flexibility of Nvidia's AI self-driving solution, from the cloud to the car we will achieve new levels of safety, comfort and personalization for future vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Xavier is also key part of the Drive Pegasus AI computing platform, a supercomputer that is the size of a license plate, and is designed for fully autonomous &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/01/25/whats-difference-level-2-level-5-autonomy/"target="new"&gt;Level 5&lt;/a&gt; robotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nvidia's Drive Xavier autonomous machine processors power the Drive software stack, which the company has expanded to a trio of AI platforms covering each aspect of next-generation cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With more than 9 billion transistors, Xavier is built around a custom 8-core CPU, a new 512-core Volta graphics processing unit (GPU), a new deep learning accelerator, new computer vision accelerators and new 8K HDR video processors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We now have all the key elements in place to take AI self-driving cars from development to mass production," Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nvidia was part of a Mercedes-Benz PR event in Amsterdam &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/02/02/mercedes-benz-a-class-mbux-ai-graphics/"target="new"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; when the 2019 A-Class was unveiled in the Noord district on the city's waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new A-Class cars are the first to offer the Mercedes-Benz User Experience -- or MBUX -- infotainment system, which uses Nvidia technology for its natural language processing and augmented reality-enhanced navigation system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Additional computational capabilities are in reserve, enabling new applications to be deployed over the life of the vehicle, and the car was designed as a learning system, anticipating user preferences the longer the system is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Uber chose cheating over innovation to catch up in a breakneck race toward self-driving cars, lawyers for rival Waymo charged Monday in opening arguments for its trade-secrets lawsuit against the ride-hailing giant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company that grew out of Google's autonomous car project fingered Uber founder Travis Kalanick as the prime culprit in the alleged theft of 14,000 confidential Google documents by former star engineer Anthony Levandowski, whom both sides called a key figure in the development of Lidar technology for automotive vision. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kalanick "made a decision that winning was more important than obeying the law," said Waymo's lead attorney, Charles Verhoeven of the firm Quinn Emmanuel. He compared the former Uber CEO to a &lt;a href=http://archive.boston.com/sports/blogs/shesgamesports/2013/03/where-are-they-now-rosie-ruiz-and-the-man-who-uncovered-her-ruse.html target="new"&gt;marathon runner&lt;/a&gt; who secretly takes the subway.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber, for its part, charged that Waymo was the company falling behind and that it sued Uber to stall its biggest rival. Levandowski brought nothing to Uber that wasn't commonly known among Lidar engineers, attorney Bill Carmody of Susman Godfrey said in Uber's opening argument. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740292&amp; target="new"&gt;jury trial&lt;/a&gt; before Judge William Alsup of the US District Court in San Francisco has put self-driving technology in the spotlight and Silicon Valley culture under the microscope. The opening arguments drew one of the biggest media throngs of any tech trial in recent memory, partly because Uber and Alphabet, the parent company of Google and Waymo, are among the most closely watched in the tech world. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even before the jury was seated on February 5, Alsup made it clear tech-star privilege would have no place in his court. One witness who had requested a private room at the courthouse wasn't going to get it, he said. "You're going to have to be just like the rest of us," Alsup said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The eight alleged secrets at issue in the case involve Lidar, the system most self-driving cars use to sense their surroundings by constantly bouncing laser beams off of objects. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We paint the world with these beams of light and figure out where things are very precisely," Waymo CEO John Krafcik said on the witness stand Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Levandowski led Google's development of Lidar until he resigned in late January 2016 for autonomous trucking startup Otto, which was founded a few days later. Otto publicly launched in May 2016 and was acquired by Uber in August, but Waymo charged that Levandowski was frequently in contact with Uber before Otto had even taken shape. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The plan all along was for Uber to "acqui-hire" Levandowski and other top Google engineers for their expertise and trade secrets they knew, Waymo's Verhoeven said, citing Uber meeting notes and other documents. The code name for this project? A dollar sign. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Uber agreed to indemnify Levandowski and other top hires against allegations of intellectual property theft, Verhoeven said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Krafcik, the first witness to take the stand, recalled taking over Google's car project in September 2015 and trying to get to know Levandowski better. "He was an interesting character," said Krafcik, a longtime automotive engineer and executive. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The two had different ideas about safety, with Levandowski opposed to Krafcik's insistence on including backup steering and braking systems in its self-driving vehicles, he said. But Levandowski's resignation the following January came as a surprise, Krafcik said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"He had gone from someone I had considered a friend to someone I considered an enemy," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber argued it took extraordinary measures to ensure it hadn't acquired any trade secrets after it acquired Otto. A forensics firm interviewed the new employees and examined the data on their personal devices, Carmody said. Waymo itself came to Uber 11 times to check its servers for proprietary information, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What Waymo calls secrets are common Lidar knowledge that Google had considered posting publicly, Uber said. The company came by its core technology legitimately by hiring a team of engineers from Carnegie-Mellon University and other elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The tech here tells the truth," Carmody said. "What's in here comes from people at Uber who bring to bear their engineering talents." &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to continue for about three weeks. Kalanick and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are among the possible witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicle technology and infrastructure is to be among the biggest areas of opportunity for automotive suppliers, according to a new market analyst from analyst firm Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/manufacturing/articles/global-automotive-supplier-study.html"target="new"&gt;Deloitte report&lt;/a&gt; study found global automotive supplier revenue opportunities could exceed $700 billion over the next decade, with nearly a quarter (24%) of respondents saying electronics, infotainment and communication are among the key concerns for their company's or client's buying agents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The results are based on answers from what Deloitte deemed global "Tier-One" automotive suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;More than a quarter (26.7%) reported that they perceive electric vehicle technology and infrastructure as the area with the most opportunities in the next ten to 15 years, followed by 22.4% who believe autonomous vehicle technology and infrastructure to be the biggest area of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Neal Ganguli, Deloitte's US automotive practice leader, told The Connected Car that the rise of autonomous vehicle technology has already affected the existing supplier space in numerous ways.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He explained it has disrupted the tradition linear automotive value chain as many non-traditional players, such as consumer technology companies, enter the automotive market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"This has added fresh competition that doesn't necessarily follow the rules of the traditional automobile supply chain," Ganguli said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ganguli noted there are already partnerships between OEMs and consumer electronics and media companies, which span across several areas, including new technologies for in-car connectivity for entertainment and services consumption, vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity and autonomous and driver assistance enablers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"These partnerships are likely to become more prevalent as traditional OEMs adopt more and more connected vehicle technology and embed mobile services such as phones, apps and media streaming into vehicles," Ganguli said. "Partnerships with more unexpected players, such as payments companies, will likely expand as consumers' expectations for their vehicles rise, bringing more segments into the mix."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;According to polling data connected to the study, approximately one-third of executives Deloitte questioned believe that flat volume and high disruption is the most likely scenario to occur in the space over the next ten to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With the automotive industry at the cusp of a major transformation, the report highlighted key forces that could cause disruption in the near and long-term future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The report warned volume headwinds could persist over the long term as a result of autonomous vehicle developments and car-sharing services that could dampen enthusiasm for self-ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, Ganguli said he believes there will be new growth opportunities for suppliers as new business models emerge in "come-to-you" mobile services, remote diagnostics, aftermarket parts and services and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"One scenario examined in our study paints a picture of highly connected, shared, and autonomous cars making a large dent in car volume, placing certain segments under significant pressure," he explained. "However, this scenario would also create new opportunities for automotive suppliers to grow in tandem with new technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The study on automotive supplier performance follows a Deloitte global automotive consumer &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/industry/automotive/advanced-vehicle-technologies-autonomous-electric-vehicles.html"target="new"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It indicated that autonomous vehicle technology represents a huge opportunity to fundamentally change the competitive playing field, and revealed brand trust, cost and safety are all major factors determining consumer acceptance of autonomous vehicle technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;More than half (54%) of US consumers in the 2017 study admitting they would be more likely to ride in an self-driving vehicle if it was offered by a brand they trust -- that number jumped to 63% in the 2018 study.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The celebrated court battle between autonomous driving hopefuls Waymo and Uber will finally begin on Monday, February 5. After nearly a year of accusations and revelations, a federal jury will hear the opening arguments in a case that could reshape the self-driving car industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The trial, under US District Court Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, is expected to last three weeks and might see Uber founder Travis Kalanick, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and other well known Silicon Valley names take the stand. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Waymo's stark &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7dzPLynxaXuQjY3dkllZ2ZKb0k/view" target="new"&gt;allegations&lt;/a&gt;, an apparent criminal probe, and the shake-up that has since rocked Uber, have brought rapt attention to the case. But what's fueling the fight is the global competition to corner what may become a &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/passenger-economy-report-infographic.html"target="new"&gt;$7 trillion industry&lt;/a&gt; by 2050. The suit could knock Uber back in a race that has drawn in the world's biggest automakers and tech companies as well as countless startups. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the heart of the case is the idea that Waymo developed important technologies first and Uber -- which didn't launch its self-driving project until 2015 -- stole its work to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Waymo, formerly Google's self-driving car project and now a division of Alphabet, is testing autonomous Chrysler Pacific minivans in at least three cities and plans to commercially launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Phoenix this year. In the past week, the company announced it would order thousands more of the vans. &lt;a href="https://www.navigantresearch.com/research/navigant-research-leaderboard-automated-driving-vehicles" target="new"&gt;Navigant Research&lt;/a&gt; recently ranked Waymo among the top companies in the business, just behind General Motors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Uber began offering test rides in self-driving cars in Pittsburgh last year and has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=740108&amp;" target="new"&gt;soon be able to operate cars without safety drivers&lt;/a&gt;. But the Navigant report ranked it as an industry challenger, two rungs below Waymo. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Google jumped on autonomous driving earlier than many, launching its self-driving car project in 2009. Former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski worked there, then left to form the autonomous truck startup Otto in 2016. Waymo alleges that before he left, Levandowski used special software on his laptop to get into Waymo's design server and download more than 14,000 confidential files about the company's Lidar designs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Other Waymo engineers who later worked for Levandowski at Otto also stole secrets, the suit charges. Waymo alleges that when Uber acquired Otto later that year, partly for its Lidar system, what it really got was technology stolen from Waymo. Lidar, which uses lasers to sense cars, people, and objects around a vehicle, is a critical component in most autonomous vehicles and the focus of a race to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=739548" target="new"&gt;boost resolution&lt;/a&gt; and cut size and cost. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Waymo says it discovered Uber was using its Lidar designs when it was accidentally copied in on an e-mail from one of Uber's Lidar component providers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Otto and Uber have taken Waymo's intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology," the complaint said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Uber promptly &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-shoots-down-googles-claims-of-stolen-self-driving-tech-2017-2" target="new"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; the charges and called the suit "a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After filing the suit on February 23, 2017, Waymo asked Judge Alsup to halt Uber's self-driving initiative until the case could be decided. In May, the judge declined to shut down the project but ordered Levandowski not to work on any Lidar-related projects. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Late last year, a letter to Alsup &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/doj-confirms-new-criminal-probe-linked-to-waymo-v-uber-lawsuit/" target="new"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that federal prosecutors were conducting a criminal investigation related to Uber's acquisition of Otto. It said they were looking into the possibility that Kalanick and Levandowski used "non-attributable electronic devices" to communicate outside of Uber's official systems. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Preparations for the trial have played out against the backdrop of a shake-up at Uber that forced Kalanick out as CEO and altered the company's board. Among the triggers were controversy over allegations of sexual harassment and underhanded surveillance practices at the company. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Projects that promote the development of autonomous vehicles are natural candidates for public-private partnerships, because AV advancement figures to greatly benefit both sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Touted as the future of transportation, self-driving cars could someday represent the vast majority of the automotive market, and they open up the automotive category to new types of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As for the general public, driverless vehicles could improve quality of life in several different ways. AV technology may someday greatly reduce on-road deaths and injuries, eliminate the expenses and hassle of private vehicle ownership and offer newfound mobility to disabled or elderly people who are unable to drive themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most common type of autonomous vehicle project on which public and private entities collaborate are testing grounds, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.acmwillowrun.org/" target="new"&gt;American Center for Mobility&lt;/a&gt; (ACM) in Ypsilanti, Township, Mich. The 500-acre site, situated on a former bomber plant, offers miles of roads for testing self-driving cars. It exists thanks to investment from both the State of Michigan and various private investors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ACM gained another investor in January when &lt;a href="https://www.subaru.com/" target="new"&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt; announced it would contribute $2 million to the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;According to Kaminga Shirakawa, vice president of Subaru Research and Development, the involvement at the American Center for Mobility is not only an opportunity for the Japanese automaker to test its autonomous vehicle technology, but also to further entrench itself in the American market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The U.S. market has long been a very important part of the success of Subaru, and as so, it is a major goal of ours to create a product that will be appealing to the U.S. customer," &lt;a href="http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180116/news/650216/subaru-invests-2-million-in-american-center-for-mobility" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Shirakawa. "We are looking forward to working with ACM in the future development of the facility and using this impressive resource to provide the highest quality products possible."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ACM has already secured $110 million of its targeted fundraising goal of $135 million. The state of Michigan has contributed $35 million has waived the center's property taxes --
   which would amount to about $1.9 million annually -- for the first 15 years. The rest of ACM's funding comes from private investors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Automakers involved in the project include Toyota, Ford and Hyundai. Other companies, like AT&amp;T and Visteon, have also invested, largely so they can test futuristic connected car technology on the ACM's tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With limited opportunities to test driverless cars on public roads, especially in the early stages of development, developers rely heavily on closed courses like the one at the American Center for Mobility. The ACM features a 2.5-mile highway loop, a 700-foot curved tunnel, two double overpasses and various types of intersections and roundabouts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Its location is also notable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the ACM's &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739190" target="new"&gt;first day&lt;/a&gt; of operation on December 11, engineers from Visteon found themselves testing in a full-on snow storm. This was far from reason to pack up and go home. Inclement weather offers a significant challenge to AV sensors of all types, and testing in a blizzard allows developers to perfect how their systems deal with these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Two startups this week took on autonomous local delivery, a service that could become one of the early commercial uses of self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On January 30, &lt;a href=https://www.udelv.com/ target="new"&gt;Udelv&lt;/a&gt; sent a small self-driving van on a short loop through suburban San Mateo, Calif., to demonstrate a planned delivery service for grocery stores and other retailers. A grocer who participated in the demonstration said Udelv's vans and ordering software could cut delivery costs in half and give customers a better idea of when their orders will arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Also on Tuesday, Silicon Valley startup &lt;a href=https://nuro.ai/ target="new"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt; unveiled an even smaller autonomous delivery vehicle with no driver’s seat or steering wheel. It’s designed for neighborhood streets and is about half the width of a typical passenger car. The company also announced it has raised $92 million in two Series A rounds of funding. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Udelv and Nuro are the latest entrants into the last-mile delivery business, which has grown with the rise of online shopping. E-commerce giants and startups alike are looking at new technologies like &lt;a href=https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?node=8037720011 target="new"&gt;drones and sidewalk-roaming &lt;a href=https://www.starship.xyz/ target="new"&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt; to cut costs and delivery times, but the task may also be well suited to autonomous vehicles on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In Udelv's demonstration on Tuesday, its autonomous van made what the company called the world's first such delivery run on public roads. It covered a 2.5-mile route from Draeger's, a local market, to two nearby customers. As required by California law, a safety driver was at the wheel to take over if necessary, but the drive went flawlessly, Udelv said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The startup, based in the neighboring town of Burlingame, designs and builds the vans itself using an electric drivetrain, chassis, sensors and other components from third parties. It won't sell the vehicles but offer delivery as a service to companies. The vehicle has a conventional cab and can be driven manually, or even remotely over a cellular connection, Udelv CEO Daniel Laury said. Its cargo space is divided into separate compartments, each with its own door that customers can unlock with their phones using Udelv's app.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The van's limited mission made it easier to develop than self-driving cars designed for passengers, Laury said. The vehicle is designed exclusively for local deliveries, with a top speed of 25 MPH. It didn't have to be designed for a comfortable ride or to deal with all possible driving and weather conditions that a long-range vehicle might run into. The van can go 60 miles between charges. It took about two years to develop, Laury said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Unlike the major auto manufacturers, Udelv can start small, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; "There is a tremendous amount of business that we can do in states... that have great weather conditions, that have very nice roads, that have good driving policies," Laury told The Connected Car. "I don't see a Ford or a General Motors, or one of those large OEMs manufacturing a car for just California, for example."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Udelv plans to put dozens of vans on the road this year in the San Francisco Bay Area. Under current state law, it can operate them autonomously in test mode with a safety driver as long as they're not making deliveries. The vans can also be used for deliveries as long as they're manually driven, Laury said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The San Mateo demonstration was done in conjunction with Draeger's, a small chain of upscale markets in the Bay Area, and Delivery Guys, which does deliveries for Draeger's. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Udelv should help Draeger's compete with big online retailers and with stores that use services like Instacart, said Richard Draeger, the owner of the chain. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Both Udelv's ordering platform and its driverless vans should make deliveries cheaper and more efficient, Draeger said. He predicts the cost of a delivery will be cut at least in half, and even more once the service is running at full volume. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"That is the biggest hurdle for delivery going mainstream," Draeger said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Also, the current four-hour delivery window that customers get can be cut to one or two hours because Udelv's app and back-end software will streamline the process, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One thing a self-driving van can't do is bring groceries to the customer's door. That's a tradeoff, but with a shorter time window, they'll be more willing to stay home and wait for the van to arrive, Draeger said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Alphabet's self-driving car project, Waymo, and General Motors, the twin titans of autonomous vehicles, were the top-performing companies for vehicle testing, according to reports that the automakers submitted to California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of its regulations, California requires companies testing its self-driving vehicles on public roads to submit a &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/disengagement_report_2017"target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on the year's test results, including disengagements, or incidents when a human operator had to manually take over the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waymo was way out in front, a leading position the company -- formerly known as the Google self-driving car project -- has held for numerous years, with just 62 disengagements reported for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Overall, the company doubled its number of autonomous miles, racking up nearly 2 million miles over a 12-month period, with Waymo's autonomous vehicles having self-driven &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738733"target="new"&gt; more than 4 million miles&lt;/a&gt; across 25 US cities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/42aff875-7ab1-4115-a72a-97f6f24b23cc/Waymofull.pdf?MOD=AJPERES"target="new"&gt;reporting period&lt;/a&gt; for California ending in November, the Waymo fleet travelled 352,545 autonomous miles in the state on public roads, navigating city streets, local neighborhoods and freeways, and saw the disengagement rate fall from 0.20 to 0.18 per thousand miles travelled.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While the California report is one indicator of Waymo's continued success, it should be pointed out that the state DMV report is only a small look into the company's ambitious program, which has shifted its center to Phoenix for the planned launch of its commercial ride-hailing service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;GM saw its vehicles drive a total of 131,676 miles in 2017, representing a 121,900-mile increase from 2016, and the company is currently seeking US government approval for a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvP82IsGqNc"target="new"&gt;fully autonomous car&lt;/a&gt;, without a steering wheel or brake and accelerator pedals, to enter the company's first commercial ride-sharing fleet next year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Albert Boniske, director of product integrity for Cruise (GM's self driving car division), wrote in a December report to the California DMV that Cruise self-driving vehicles, which are based on the Chevrolet Bolt platform, were used for all testing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Boniske noted all the driving was done on San Francisco's complex city streets, with 105 reported disengagements during the 12-month period -- with a little under half of those disengagements undertaken due to other road users behaving poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Cities like San Francisco contain significantly more people, cars, and cyclists that our self-driving vehicles must be aware of at any given time," Boniske &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/d94d9334-9955-4f97-aae1-5a2c9f10673b/GM_Cruise.pdf?MOD=AJPERES"target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;. "That makes San Francisco one of the hardest places to test a self-driving vehicle, and creates a rich environment for testing our object detection, prediction, and response functions. It also helps us validate our vehicles' self-driving skills faster than testing in a suburban location alone."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waymo's testing is not just limited to real-world roads, however. In a Medium post touting its progress, Waymo revealed that last year the company drove an additional 2.7 billion miles in the virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"At its peak, Waymo's simulators complete 2,000 complex driving scenarios each second," the post &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/the-worlds-longest-and-toughest-ongoing-driving-test-44464867865b"target="new"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In January, research firm Navigant released a &lt;a href="https://www.navigantresearch.com/research/navigant-research-leaderboard-automated-driving-vehicles"target="new"&gt;leaderboard&lt;/a&gt; evaluating 19 companies developing automated driving systems, and found GM in the lead, followed by Waymo, Daimler-Bosch and Ford, with Volkswagen rounding out the Top Five.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk's Tesla finished dead last, despite the sophistication of the company's vehicles and the high-profile efforts Telsa has made to introduce Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to the market.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Automotive giant Ford has filed a patent for a driverless police car that uses artifical intelligence (AI) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to nab law-breaking drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The patent application was filed in December by &lt;a href="https://corporate.ford.com/innovation.html"target="new"&gt;Ford Global Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of Ford Motor Company, and is currently under review by the US government.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A wirelessly connected or "smart" traffic light, for example, would identify a vehicle that ran a red light and relay not only the license plate number and description of the vehicle, but also provide the driverless police car with the vehicle's location, allowing the Robocop car to follow the car and issue a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this instance, both vehicles are in communication with each other. For instance, if the violating vehicle is itself in self-driving mode that information will automatically be relayed to the police car, which will then respond indicating a disposition, such as a ticket or warning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If the vehicle is under driver control, the vehicle will send the self-driving police car a photo of the operator's driver's license.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition to the vehicle's description and location, the police car would also be able to access information about the owner, the car's history of violations and registration information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By automating routine police tasks, such as issuing tickets for speeding or failure to stop at a stop sign, police departments will be able to use human officers for tasks that can't be automated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; "While autonomous vehicles can and will be programmed to obey traffic laws, a human driver can override that programming to control and operate the vehicle at any time," according to the patent &lt;a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20180018869.pdf"target="new"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt;. "When a vehicle is under the control of a human driver there is a possibility of violation of traffic laws. Thus, there will still be a need to police traffic."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The patent application noted the technology can be adapted to a variety of network computing environments involving in-dash vehicle computers, PCs, notebooks and mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In Dubai, child-sized self-driving police vehicles have already&lt;a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/emergencies/dubai-police-to-deploy-robotic-patrols-1.2049873"target="new"&gt; hit the streets&lt;/a&gt;, in this cased used as surveillance vehicles equipped with biometric software to scan for criminals. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While Ford and the city of Dubai are working on self-driving cop cars, Waymo -- Alphabet's autonomous vehicle project -- is running tests to help make other self-driving cars respond quickly to emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Chandler police and fire departments in Arizona, Alphabet-owned Waymo has been conducting emergency vehicle testing with their self-driving minivans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waymo's self-driving vehicles are &lt;a href="https://medium.com/waymo/recognizing-the-sights-and-sounds-of-emergency-vehicles-8161e90d137e"target="new"&gt; designed to interact&lt;/a&gt; with law enforcement and first responders.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Using a suite of custom-built sensors, the vehicle's software can identify a nearby fire truck or police car, detect its flashing lights, and hear sirens.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The sensors are designed to locate the direction sirens are likely coming from, improving the vehicle's ability to respond quickly and safely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once an emergency vehicle is detected, the vehicle can respond by yielding, pulling over to the side of the road, or coming to a complete stop. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p05300613/Autonomous-Trucks-and-Buses.html"target="new"&gt;Tractica report&lt;/a&gt;, which examines the market and technology issues surrounding autonomous trucks and buses, estimates unit shipments will increase from just 343 vehicles in 2017 to 188,000 units in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tractica cited more competition within the industry as a factor in providing significant opportunities to various industry participants, with the market reaching a value of $35 billion by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the phrase "driverless cars" has been something of a misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With the technology still being developed, safety concerns have necessitated at least one, and sometimes two, human monitors inside of autonomous vehicles. These monitors check the status of a vehicle and are ready to take over control should it become necessary. Of course, "self-driving cars with fully alert engineer attendants" doesn't quite have the same ring to it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But the day of truly "driverless" cars is approaching. &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, which has been a leader in the development of autonomous ride-hailing fleets, recently claimed that it was getting close to launching autonomous vehicles that could operate without a human backup. Eric Meyhofer, head of Uber's Advanced Technology Group that oversees self-driving cars, told the Associated Press that the company would put the monitor-free cars on roads once it felt it was completely safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Once we can check that box, which we call passing the robot driver's license test, that's when we can remove the vehicle operator," Meyhofer &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2018-01-17/uber-close-to-scrapping-human-backups-in-self-driving-cars" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. "We're going aggressively too."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber does seem to have made significant strides recently. It was only in October that Uber said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736654" target="new"&gt;remove a passenger's seat operator&lt;/a&gt; from its self-driving vehicles, leaving only one human operator in the driver's seat. The move was part of the relaunch of Uber's autonomous ride-hailing service in Pittsburgh, which originally began in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As of now, only one company has officially announced that it will put operator-free AVs on the road: &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;. In November, the company divulged that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;already launched&lt;/a&gt; truly driverless cars around Phoenix, where it does much of its testing. It also released plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in that very area in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber, of course, is currently embroiled in a lawsuit filed by Waymo, alleging that former Waymo executive Anthony Levandowski stole thousands of proprietary files from the Google spin-off and brought them to Uber, where he went to work soon after. Late last year, a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739274" target="new"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; emerged in the case that described unethical work practices at Uber, including the use of "stolen Waymo trade secrets." While the case figures to drag on for far longer than anyone would like it to, it has already contributed to a significant decline in Uber's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether deploying a fully driverless fleet will improve that reputation. But big technology breakthroughs in the autonomous vehicle space are tough to ignore. If Uber can show that is at least keeping pace with Waymo in the race to create truly autonomous vehicles, it will go a long way to helping the company reclaim its status.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Because there are so many more components to an autonomous vehicle, there are, accordingly, a lot more things that need to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Most self-driving cars use a combination of Lidar-, radar- and camera-based sensors that each need to be tested individually and as a collective group. It isn't enough to see how they perform in idealized conditions. These tests need to take place in a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739278" target="new"&gt;variety of weather and lighting conditions&lt;/a&gt;, because sensors can behave differently in inclement weather like snow and at nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition to improving the sensors themselves, there are also efforts underway to develop the objects that they are sensing. Automotive paint company &lt;a href="http://corporate.ppg.com/Home.aspx" target="new"&gt;PPG&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that it had partnered with &lt;a href="https://mcity.umich.edu/our-work/mcity-test-facility/" target="new"&gt;MCity&lt;/a&gt;, the public-private autonomous vehicle test facility at the University of Michigan, to develop and test paints and coatings designed specifically for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Specialized coatings will play an integral role in the development of safe and reliable driverless vehicles," Gary Danowski, PPG vice president of automotive OEM coatings, wrote in a &lt;a href="http://newsroom.ppg.com/getmedia/08cfb1cf-def2-4244-8b06-53ac14b0d378/PPG-NAIAS-McityPartnership-011518-vFINAL.pdf.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We are enthusiastic about this partnership and are always actively seeking additional R&amp;D partners as we continue to explore new possibilities in emerging vehicle technologies."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the projects that PPG will work on at MCity is the creation of a specialized car paint that can be detected more easily by autonomous car sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Glare from the sun that bounces off traditional car paints can confuse a driverless car's systems. This may have played a role in the &lt;a href="http://abc7news.com/automotive/tesla-self-driving-car-fails-to-detect-truck-in-fatal-crash/1410042/" target="new"&gt;2016 crash&lt;/a&gt; involving a driver using Tesla's Autopilot feature, which is the first-known fatal accident involving semiautonomous driving technology. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another potential project involves the sensors themselves. PPG suggested it will try to develop easy-to-clean coatings that would protect an autonomous vehicle's sensor hardware. As anyone who has ever waited too long to wash their car can attest, automobiles get dirty fast. Lidar sensors are no exception, but specialized coatings could mitigate the effect dirt or debris would have on their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Opened in 2015, MCity is the "world's first purpose-build facility" for testing driverless and connected cars, and their accompanying technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It's home to a wide variety of AV projects, including an on-campus &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734742" target="new"&gt;driverless shuttle&lt;/a&gt; for the University of Michigan's engineering students and faculty that was designed by the French company Navya.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Autonomous vehicle technology offers numerous real-world advantages, and the ability to test such technologies safely and thoroughly is essential for proving the viability of advanced mobility solutions," MCity director Huei Peng noted in the statement. "Our state-of-the-art facility offers a controlled environment for manufacturers like PPG to develop and hone the capabilities of autonomous vehicles and related technologies, while also providing them access to a variety of valuable tools and resources. We're excited to have PPG be part of this journey."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As Waymo plans to expand its self-driving, ride-sharing services across the US, the company has now ordered "thousands" of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to expand its ever-growing autonomous vehicle fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fcanorthamerica.com/Pages/Home.aspx"target="new"&gt;Chrysler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/"target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; have a relationship dating to 2016, when the two companies agreed to a deal for a fleet of 100 minivans. That agreement later expanded to 500 vehicles in 2017, and on January 30, the two &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fca-us-llc-set-to-deliver-thousands-of-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-minivans-to-waymos-self-driving-service-300589929.html"target="new"&gt;expanded the relationship&lt;/a&gt; to involve more of these hybrid vehicles, although both declined to release a specific number.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Pacifica minivans are due to arrive later this year, when Waymo expands its autonomous ride-sharing service. The first stop is Phoenix, where the company, along with many others, is testing autonomous and self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From there, Waymo, which is an Alphabet company, will move across the US, including Atlanta, San Francisco, Metro Detroit and Kirkland, Wash.&lt;/p&gt;

  {videoembed|738878}

  &lt;p&gt;When this expansion happens, Waymo expects the vehicles to operate at Level 4 autonomy, meaning that no driver is needed as part of the service. These vehicles were jointly developed by engineers from Waymo and FCA, the parent company of Chrysler.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In a statement, both companies note that these types of minivans offer the ideal combination of electrical, powertrain, chassis and other systems structures to support Waymo's combination of hardware and software that helps create self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"With the world's first fleet of fully self-driving vehicles on the road, we've moved from research and development, to operations and deployment," Waymo CEO John Krafcik wrote in Tuesday's announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Waymo is not the only company to attempt a self-driving, ride-sharing service, but the company now seems further ahead compared to some of its competition. For instance, General Motors' self-driving subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738822"target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; is developing a similar service for what the company calls "dense urban environments" that will be available sometime in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Uber, which helped pioneered the ride-sharing market, has been testing self-driving vehicles in the Pittsburgh area, and taking advantage of that city's engineering talent. The company also &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738515"target="new"&gt;recently cut a deal&lt;/a&gt; with Volvo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The prospective benefits of having autonomous vehicles on our roads are many. Foremost among them is safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=738177"target="new"&gt;oft-cited estimate&lt;/a&gt; is that driverless cars will eventually reduce on-road fatalities by 90%. The 24/7 availability of autonomous ride-hailing fleets will also make our lives more convenient, and perhaps less expensive as we transition away from individual ownership of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another major benefit is accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Underserved populations such as the blind and the elderly, who are often isolated due to their inability to drive, could dramatically improve their lives with greater mobility options.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This has been a prominent feature of autonomous vehicle legislation in the US. Both the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736110" target="new"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736893" target="new"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; have provisions in their driverless car bills that would establish councils to advocate for those with disabilities to receive access to self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To gain greater understanding of how self-driving cars can impact the elderly, there's no better place to test than in large-scale retirement communities. That is exactly what self-driving taxi company &lt;a href="https://voyage.auto/" target="new"&gt;Voyage&lt;/a&gt; has done in Florida, where it announced it will be bringing a ride-hailing fleet to service the 125,000-person retirement community of The Villages. With over 750 miles of road and three distinct downtowns, The Villages offers great variety to its residents. And with Voyage's fleet of robotaxis, they'll have easy, autonomous access to all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Residents of The Villages will first need to download the Voyage rider app, which features an interface not unlike that of Uber or Lyft. They can then order a Voyage self-driving car to come pick them up, and enter in their destination. After they've completed their trip -- perhaps shopping at one of The Villages' eight grocery stores, or catching a movie at one of its three theaters -- they can order another Voyage ride to take them home. It's like a standard ride-hailing service, except the car is driving itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Villages, Florida, is actually Voyage's second pilot community for this type of project. The first was another The Villages community in San Jose, Calif. In a New York Times article, one former board president at The Villages in San Jose described accidents caused by elderly drivers in the community that involved cars ending up in ponds and tennis courts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The driverless car would be far less risky than the drivers that we currently have," he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/technology/driverless-cars-testing.html" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To generate HD maps for all 750 miles of roads within The Villages that can be read by the autonomous taxis, Voyage has partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.carmera.com/" target="new"&gt;Carmera&lt;/a&gt;. Carmera will not only render initial maps of the entire community, but also continuously update them via data accrued from sensors on the Voyage vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Voyage also announced that it had completed a Series A round of fundraising, bringing its fundraising total in 2017 to over $20 million. That money will go directly toward investing in expanded services for The Villages.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicle technology is fertile ground for startups. Since almost all of the technology involved is still developing, small companies have ample opportunity to get involved, innovate and compete with larger companies on AV components such as Lidar sensors, artificial intelligence systems and HD mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But building a self-driving car from the ground up? That's an area that's still for the most part reserved for the big boys.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It's no coincidence that the companies taking on this challenge are traditional automakers. Even a self-driving heavyweight like Waymo still relies on a fleet of minivans produced by Chrysler. There are so many hardware and software costs associated with building a complete driverless car that it's hard to see how an independent startup could realistically compete.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That is not deterring the team at self-driving startup &lt;a href="https://www.pony.ai/" target="new"&gt;Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;. Pony.ai was only founded in late 2016, but it has set its sights on building a complete driverless car. If it falls short of its goals it probably won't be for lack of money. It was recently announced that Pony.ai received a whopping $112 million in financing for its Series A round.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The fundraising was led by Morningside Venture Capital and Legend Capital, each of which has a primary focus on Chinese investments. (Pony.ai is "co-located" in Silicon Valley and Beijing.) Also participating in the round were Sequoia China, IDG Capital, Hongtai Capital, Legend Star, Puhua Capital, Polaris Capital, DCM Ventures, Comcast Ventures and Silicon Valley Future Capital. As the size of the investment suggests, these partners believe that Pony.ai has a chance to make an enormous splash in the autonomous vehicle space.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Pony.ai is one of the very few companies we've seen that possesses the critical success factors: a team with a proven track record and extremely well-rounded technical expertise from both research and industry backgrounds," Legend Capital managing director Wenji Jin noted in a &lt;a href="https://nbherard.com/business/autonomous-driving-startup-pony-ai-raises-112m/55555" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "From product definition and systems integration to artificial intelligence, Pony.ai is the leader in this nascent industry. I believe Pony.ai holds the most promise in delivering [Level 4 vehicular autonomy] technology to the mass market."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company's co-founders do indeed have an impressive pedigree. Co-founder and CTO Tiancheng Lou worked on Google's self-driving car project before it was spun off into what is now Waymo. Co-founder and CEO James Peng was a founding member of Baidu's autonomous driving team.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Pony.ai will use the Series A funding to launch an autonomous fleet in Guangzhou, China, where the company has an office. Before that, though, he says the company has some testing to do to ensure its vehicles can coexist with human-driven cars in real-world scenarios, according to Peng.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"I think in the grand scheme of things the biggest challenge is still the uncertainty in the open driving environment," Peng told &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/15/one-year-old-pony-ai-raises-112-million-series-a-to-build-autonomous-car-future/" target="new"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. "Robots have been out there for 30-40 years, and most of them are working in somewhat confined environments. Vehicles themselves are like robots, but they have to operate in uncertain environments."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;A connected car system involves a ton of moving parts. Given the incredibly large amount of data that moves in and out of infotainment systems, advanced driver assistance systems, security systems and telematics systems for diagnostics, the processors in these vehicles have a lot on their plates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This expands exponentially when the conversation shifts to self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In addition to operating the aforementioned connected car systems at the highest-possible levels, autonomous vehicles need to integrate a suite of various sensors and HD maps into an operating system that utilizes cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And the more lines of code there are underpinning all these operations, the more opportunity there is for mistakes and mishaps. But when it comes to multi-ton automobiles traveling at high speeds with living, breathing passengers on board, there isn't room for mistakes and mishaps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To help quell the concerns of connected car and autonomous vehicle developers looking to ensure they've made the safest products possible, &lt;a href="https://us.blackberry.com/" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; has introduced Jarvis, a new cybersecurity product for automakers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry CEO John Chen introduced Jarvis at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The software is able to scan binary files for coding errors or flaws. Jarvis also searches the files to ensure that they adhere to industry standards. Jarvis will operate as a cloud-based subscription service, meaning that customers pay as they go and can upload files to be scanned from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Given the aforementioned high stakes of fast-moving automobiles, there is great concern throughout the automotive industry regarding what would happen if a self-driving car were to be hacked and controlled remotely. Though less harrowing, of equal concern is the hacking of personal data, including financial information, by accessing connected car systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Connected and autonomous vehicles require some of the most complex software ever developed, creating a significant challenge for automakers who must ensure the code complies with industry and manufacturer-specific standards while simultaneously battle-hardening a very large and tempting attack surface for cybercriminals," Chen &lt;a href="https://us.blackberry.com/company/newsroom/press?id=2173233" target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jaguarlandrover.com/" target="new"&gt;Jaguar Land Rover&lt;/a&gt;, a preexisting &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738151" target="new"&gt; BlackBerry partner&lt;/a&gt;, has already signed on to use Jarvis in the development of connected and driverless car systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Jaguar Land Rover and BlackBerry share a common objective in bringing the most intelligent vehicles to reality," Jaguar Land Rover CEO Ralf Speth wrote in the statement. "BlackBerry Jarvis addresses the software cybersecurity needs of the automotive industry. In our independent study, Jarvis delivered excellent efficiencies in time-to-market, significantly reducing the time to security assess code from thirty days to seven minutes. The productivity delivered by Jarvis combined with BlackBerry's trusted security heritage can transform vehicle safety."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Jarvis also has applications outside of automotives. BlackBerry noted that healthcare, aerospace and defense industries could all find the scanner useful. &lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are two primary schools of thought when it comes to safety and self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One perspective holds up the belief that driverless cars will significantly reduce automotive fatalities -- by as much as 90%, according to one commonly cited statistic. To reach that point faster, we should accelerate the rate of introduction of AVs onto our roads now so that it will take less time for them to be perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The opposing viewpoint is that it is unethical to rush self-driving cars onto public roads before they're fully developed. The obvious reason is that it could put people's lives in danger. But a secondary explanation is that if imperfect driverless cars are introduced too early, it could damage the reputation of driverless cars down the road, thus limiting their future potential.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Of course, no one thinks that an underdeveloped driverless car should be recklessly testing in actual public traffic, but the debate about release timelines continues to dominate the world of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In a speech at the Detroit Auto Show on earlier this month, US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao straddled the line between enthusiasm for the development of autonomous vehicles and caution in their development. She also announced a new set of AV guidelines, which she referred to as AV 3.0, that will be released in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The guidelines, Chao said, won't focus exclusively on driverless cars -- they'll address all forms of vehicular autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"AV 3.0 will include guidance for more than just automobiles," Chao &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/detroit-auto-show" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. "It will address barriers to the safe integration of autonomous technology for motor carriers, transit, trucks, infrastructure and other modes, as well. The Department will update this guidance as often as needed. That's part of our commitment to streamline the process and to keep pace with innovation."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It was only in September, when the DOT released its last iteration of these guidelines, called "&lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736369" target="new"&gt;A Vision for Safety 2.0&lt;/a&gt;." Those followed the inaugural guidelines that were released a year earlier. In her remarks, Chao said that this frequent updating was a reflection of the fast-moving development of technology in the AV space.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Chao also addressed the frequently discussed issue surrounding the impact self-driving cars could have on professional drivers and their job security. Some analysts believe that tens of thousands of people could lose their jobs. In Detroit, Chao lauded the Auto Show for partnering with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to host the first-ever Future Automotive Career Exposition at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Chao aligned the DOT with the belief that eliminating barriers to AV deployment is the greatest means of promoting automotive safety at large.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"At the US Department of Transportation, safety will always be our number one priority," she said. "That's why a key part of DOT's mission is to cultivate and encourage innovation in safety by eliminating unnecessary obstacles to the development and integration of new technology."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;There are fewer and fewer things in life these days that go undocumented. With everyone carrying a camera with them at all times thanks to their mobile phones, if something interesting takes place in public view, odds are that that a picture or video will capture the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is especially true with autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They are hard to keep secret. The sheer size of them makes them conspicuous, and there is a lot of interest. A single tweet about an Apple driverless car that was spied on the road created its own minor &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737637" target="new"&gt;news cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One AV company that consistently draws attention is &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;. As a frontrunner in the race to design a fully autonomous vehicle, the company is frequently making news as it achieves various milestones. One area that is closely being watched is Waymo's expansion plans. And in January, news of new urban testing grounds for Waymo came out in ways both intended and unintended.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;First, TechCrunch obtained a photograph suggesting that Waymo was testing in San Francisco. (This was subsequently confirmed by Waymo through a written statement.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then, the company took things into its own hands by tweeting that it would soon also begin testing in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On January 12, TechCrunch &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/12/waymos-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-begins-testing-in-san-francisco/" target="new"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a photo of one of Waymo's instantly recognizable self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans operating on the streets of San Francisco. Aside from confirming the previously unannounced development, Waymo did not offer many additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"San Francisco was one of the first cities where we tested our self-driving cars, dating back to 2009 when we traveled everything from Lombard Street to the Golden Gate Bridge," a Waymo spokesperson wrote to TechCrunch. "Now that we have the world's first fleet of fully self-driving cars running in Arizona, the hilly and foggy streets of San Francisco will give our cars even more practice in different terrains and environments."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The return to the Bay Area follows Waymo's prominent testing in the Phoenix suburbs, where it is breaking new ground this year by testing self-driving cars that are &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;unaccompanied by human operators&lt;/a&gt;, and launching an autonomous ride-hailing service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the past, &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt;, one of Waymo's primary competitors, has snidely referenced Waymo's heavy reliance on the relatively calm streets of suburban Arizona as a way of promoting &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;doc_id=736316" target="new"&gt;Cruise's own intensive testing&lt;/a&gt; on the hectic streets of San Francisco. Now that Waymo is back in SF, the company figures to be immune from such barbs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With the Atlanta news, Waymo didn't wait for news to leak and and revealed the launch of its driverless service with a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Waymo/status/955492529998241792" target="new"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;: "Hello ATL! Metro Atlanta is the next stop for Waymo's test program. Now that we have the world's first fully self-driving vehicles on public roads in AZ, we're looking to take our tech to more cities."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While Waymo did not put out a more detailed press release or blog post, Georgia governor Nathan Deal was enthusiastic in discussing the expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"With our talented workforce and legacy of innovation, Georgia is at the forefront of the most dynamic, cutting edge industries like autonomous vehicles," Deal &lt;a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/local/gridlock-guy-driverless-cars-may-improve-road-safety/WbKQNSFQrJt7bBJWtUr2aM/" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. "We are thrilled to welcome Waymo to our state because fully self-driving vehicle technology holds tremendous potential to improve road safety, and we are proud Georgia is paving the way for the future of transportation."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley was a hub of innovation long before the days of Tesla, Facebook or eBay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The seeds of Silicon Valley's reputation were planted by the universities and governmental research facilities that pre-dated "big tech" companies by a significant margin.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One such research facility was the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) that was first established in 1939. When NASA was created in 1958, the NACA facility was renamed the Ames Research Center, or NASA Ames. Over its nearly 80 years of existence, NASA Ames has done important research on propeller-driven aircrafts, spaceflight technology, and information technology that have been incorporated on missions to space.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html" target="new"&gt;NASA Ames&lt;/a&gt; remains on the cutting edge of technological research, and the fruits of that research are finding applications here on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At CES, NASA and &lt;a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; announced that they were extending a pre-existing agreement to jointly research and develop future autonomous mobility services. The companies also unveiled plans for a "working demonstration" of those services that will take place in Silicon Valley some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The agreement between Nissan and NASA Ames was first established &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames/from-rovers-to-self-driving-cars-nasa-ames-and-nissan-north-america-sign-agreement" target="new"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally framed as an umbrella deal that would allow for partnerships "in autonomous vehicle systems, robotics, human-machine interface, software analysis/verification and network-enabled applications."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At CES 2017, the partners revealed their largest project to date: an autonomous driving platform fleet solution known as Seamless Autonomous Mobility, or SAM. According to Nissan and NASA said, SAM was built on some of the same technology that was used to operate the Mars Rover.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"This is not only a demonstration of the transfer of space technology to industry, but also the application of their research back to our space technology, with additional uses for our unmanned aircraft systems research. This is a perfect example of technology literally driving exploration and enabling future space missions," NASA Ames director Eugene Tu &lt;a href="http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/press-kit-nissan-intelligent-mobility-at-ces?query=nasa+ames+seamless+autonomous+mobility" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The announcements were a little less concrete at this year's event, but it was clear that Nissan hopes to have SAM on the road in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We built SAM from technology NASA developed for managing interplanetary rovers as they move around unpredictable landscapes," Maarten Sierhuis, director of the Nissan Research Center in Silicon Valley, wrote in a &lt;a href="http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/channels/us-united-states-nissan/releases/nissan-and-nasa-extend-research-into-autonomous-mobility-services" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Our goal is to deploy SAM to help third-party organizations safely integrate a fleet of autonomous vehicles in unpredictable urban environments, for example ride-hailing services, public transportation or logistics and delivery services. The final stage of our existing research agreement with NASA will bring us closer to that goal and test SAM in a working demonstration on public streets."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As the autonomous vehicle sector grows, most experts anticipate that autonomous ride-hailing services will slowly begin to replace personal vehicle ownership.&lt;/P&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thus, the mobility-as-a-service space figures to be quite crowded indeed. For Nissan, having the cachet of the NASA name attached to its product may help separate the automaker from its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In theory, there's no reason why a fully autonomous vehicle would need pedals or a steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If a driverless car is turning, accelerating and braking entirely on its own, the auto parts that allow humans to perform these tasks become redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Removing unnecessary hardware would create more interior space in cars and allow automakers to design more effective safety systems. Plus, if you subscribe to the belief that, in the future, autonomous systems will be better at driving safely than humans by an order of magnitude, then there's an argument to be made that self-driving cars shouldn't enable people to pilot their cars at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Of course, none of that makes it less unusual to see a car interior designed without a steering wheel or pedals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So it's a bit strange to look at the fourth generation concept of &lt;a href="http://www.gm.com/" target="new"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;'s electric self-driving car, the Cruise AV, which was revealed at CES.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Cruise AV's design eliminates the steering wheel and pedals completely, and this is not some design exercise that will never see the light of day. GM said that the vehicle will begin testing on roads in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;Center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvP82IsGqNc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"By integrating our self-driving system into the vehicle from the beginning, and through close coordination between the hardware and software teams, we have evaluated potential failure modes for all systems, and addressed them throughout development to ensure a safe and reliable product," GM wrote in a comprehensive &lt;a href="http://www.gm.com/content/dam/gm/en_us/english/selfdriving/gmsafetyreport.pdf" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; framed as a self-driving safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"This comprehensive, integrated approach to safety, combined with testing in one of the most complex environments in the world, allows us to safely take the next step -- elimination of the steering wheel, pedals and other manual controls -- from the vehicle," according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Testing in complex environments has consistently been a key aspect for &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt;, GM's self-driving subsidiary. This past October, CEO Kyle Vogt described why the company primarily tests its vehicles on the chaotic streets of San Francisco, not so subtly throwing shade at &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; and other AV developers that largely test driverless cars on the calmer, more uniform streets of suburban Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

  {image 1}

  &lt;p&gt;"Testing in the hardest places first means we'll get to scale faster than starting with the easier ones," Vogt &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737053" target="new"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "This may seem counterintuitive, but by testing in densely populated areas we expose our software to unusual situations at a much higher rate, which means we can improve our software at a much higher rate. Based on our experience, every minute of testing in San Francisco is about as valuable as an hour of testing in the suburbs."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The 2019 testing date of the wheel-less, pedal-less Cruise AV is in line with the timeframe that GM and Cruise have given for introducing their &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738822" target="new"&gt;driverless ride-hailing program&lt;/a&gt;. Much is still not known about that initiative, including where it will launch ("dense urban environments" is all that's been said publicly so far).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, by developing a concept vehicle that is so radically removed from those currently on the road, GM and Cruise are continuing their philosophy of taking big steps early on in the process, instead of a series of baby steps. It's a bold approach that could pay off big.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The autonomous vehicle industry is facing a worker shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The technical skills required to be a driverless car engineer are extensive and advanced, and there is generally a greater demand for workers than there is supply.&lt;/P&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Since self-driving car technology is so new, few engineers have had the time to acquire the skill set required to jump right in. But for those workers that are qualified, the benefits can be immense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Many of the companies developing autonomous technology have received major injections of capital, so they have the cash to pay to employees that meet a very specific set of criteria. That's why getting workers trained in the skills they will need has become such an important aspect of the race to get driverless cars on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At CES, Chinese tech giant and autonomous vehicle developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/baidu_inc?lang=en" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; announced a bold and innovative strategy to not only expand the driverless engineer workforce overall, but also to assist in Baidu's own pursuit of talent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Baidu revealed that it had partnered with tech education company &lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="new"&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt; to build an online course dedicated solely to training workers to build and develop on Apollo, Baidu's open-source autonomous driving platform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Udacity, founded and led by driverless vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738354" target="new"&gt;pioneer&lt;/a&gt; Sebastian Thrun, offers so-called "nanodegree" programs online for aspiring workers in fields like data analysis, virtual reality development and digital marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Given Thrun's background, though, the company is best known for its courses that train engineers to work in autonomous vehicle design and development. According to Udacity head of self-driving cars David Silver, the Apollo course will be the first of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Our Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program is an intense nine-month journey to becoming a self-driving car engineer, and it offers an amazing learning experience, but it is for advanced engineers," Silver wrote in a Medium &lt;a href="https://medium.com/udacity/udacity-and-baidus-new-course-introduction-to-apollo-4eb244313e8c" target="new"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. "And while our Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree program is an excellent point-of-entry for aspiring learners newer to the field, it offers an equally immersive experience. This course offers adds something new and important to the range of learning options."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While various companies are working to develop proprietary self-driving car platforms that they hope will become the universal standard going forward, Apollo is arguably the best known platform in the industry that is already in development.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Baidu has an unparalleled list of partners who are helping develop Apollo, a roster that includes &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739493" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739564" target="new"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734772" target="new"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Baidu has always been an open source platform, but this education outreach through Udacity figures to help the company attract a greater number of Apollo contributors beyond its official partners.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Baidu is not the only company working on autonomous vehicles that has teamed up with Udacity to offer educational opportunities. &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736597" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; is funding 400 scholarships for students to complete driverless car courses through the service, and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738498" target="new"&gt;Infosys&lt;/a&gt; contracted with Udacity to broaden its own engineers' knowledge in self-driving tech.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But this is the first time that Udacity has built an entire course tailored to one company's proprietary technology. And having more workers trained in its platform, gives Baidu yet another advantage in its quest to create the new industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Hyundai Motor Company and Cisco announced a new partnership to develop a connected car platform with a focus on security and the optimization of data flow, both in and out of a vehicle and within it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Future connected cars will open new innovations in quality, safety, and security, as never before. By expanding time and space, more safety will be guaranteed for our customers," &lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt; vice chairman Euisun Chung &lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/about-hyundai/news/corporate_hyundai-motor-and-cisco-collaborate-for-global-connected-car-project-20160419.aspx" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. "This collaboration will be a chance to bring closer the Hyundai Motor-led future of connected cars and shift paradigms of new mobility."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Less than two years later, at CES 2018 in Las Vegas, the two companies announced that they are close to delivering on the promise of an entirely new connected car platform that is flexible, secure, highly configurable, and designed not just to accommodate innovation, but actively encourage it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 2019, Hyundai and &lt;a href="https://www.cisco.com/" target="new"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; plan to unveil a jointly developed connected car based on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Cisco is pleased to bring a standards-based approach in partnership with the automotive industry; one that will help accelerate innovation and increase the value to the consumer," Cisco Vice President Ruba Borno wrote in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;amp;articleId=1903971" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "By creating a flexible, scalable, and secure platform, we are allowing automotive companies to deliver better cars -- faster."&lt;/p&gt;

  {videoembed|739856}

  &lt;p&gt;Cisco and Hyundai say that the key to the platform is an emphasis on what they call Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) architecture, a method of design that ensures the ability to reconfigure and build upon the platform in the future. This is one of the most important characteristics a modern vehicle platform can possess, as the lightning-fast speed of technological change and growth in the connected car space guarantees substantial adjustments to vehicle software with each passing year. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the most important ways that Hyundai and Cisco are making the platform so flexible going forward is by incorporating over-the-air (OTA) updates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As Jeremy Kaplan at &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/hyundai-cisco-in-vehicle-networking/" target="new"&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/a&gt; reports, infotainment systems will be the first element of Hyundai and Cisco's collaborative vehicle to receive OTA updates. Due to their obviously sensitive nature, safety updates will only be deployed once they are 100% effective.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The fact that all electronic devices can hear -- are hearing -- everything we say, and all the devices are able to see us, hear us, and interact with us," Hyundai Design Center EVP Luc Donckerwolke told Kaplan. "We have to think about all that as designer... it's a question we have to address."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The next generation of the connected car is dependent upon the forthcoming arrival of 5G connectivity, something that promises to bring far greater speeds to mobile networks. With its platform reportedly capable of handling data transmission speeds of 1 gigabyte per second, Hyundai and Cisco platform are primed to take advantage of the technology as soon as it arrives.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;For almost three years, Android phone users have had an easy way of -- safely -- accessing many of the functions on their devices while driving. By connecting their Android phones to their cars, they could use voice commands or a driver-friendly touch display interface for navigation, entertainment and communication apps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Those services were all part of &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/auto/" target="new"&gt;Android Auto&lt;/a&gt;, an app developed by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/" target="new"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; that is compatible with more than 400 models of cars from more than 40 brands, including Ford, GM and Volvo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At CES 2018 earlier this month, Google delivered some good news for users of the app: Google was beefing up the app with the addition of Google Assistant, the high-functioning voice recognition technology that will now be able to service drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOcMSsuppV4rCYbz-ufx4DyXNKBCzOjOp" target="new"&gt;A series of videos&lt;/a&gt; from Android, demonstrate some of what Google Assistant will offer drivers, all while allowing them to keep their eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In one video -- "Plan your day" -- a driver asks the system what her schedule is for the day. Google Assistant informs her of a 10:00 a.m. meeting and a 1:00 p.m. lunch date. She also asks her Google Assistant to navigate her to work and the system immediately pulls up turn-by-turn directions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rz00UQ3dQyE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Entertainment apps are also easily engaged with Google Assistant via Android Auto. In another video, a driver requests to listen to her Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify. When she doesn't recognize the artist, she asks Google Assistant who the artist is and receives a concise response. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It's a long list of useful services, although not a particularly groundbreaking one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As noted in stories from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16860338/google-assistant-android-auto-support-update-ces-2018" target="new"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2018/01/09/google-assistant-now-android-auto-apparently-wasnt/" target="new"&gt;Android Police&lt;/a&gt;, the user experience will not change drastically. Google Voice search had powered much of the functionality in earlier versions of Android Auto, but now the app will receive the complete functionality possible with Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While asking for directions and dictating messages were possible without Google Assistant, the addition does present some new possibilities. It will be easier to establish personal preferences. You won't need to ask Google Assistant to play a song "on Spotify," as it will already know that is your preferred app for music. The ability to control Internet of Things (IoT) devices is also new. For example, users will be able to adjust the lights in their home from their car. Some users are excited about the change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Actually, the lack of full [Google Assistant] in Android Auto has been driving me insane," writes commenter Quinton in the top-voted comment on the Android Police post. "I keep asking how late a store is open, for example, and voice search just gets massively confused. This will be better."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There's plenty of competition in the in-vehicle voice assistance space, as hands-free functionality is more important in an automobile than perhaps any other setting. By enhancing what Android Auto can do with the addition of Google Assistant, Google has made a small but important improvement to a product that is already popular among Android users.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The automotive space has become one of the most exciting sectors for investment in recent months. With electric cars, connected cars and self-driving cars all expected to grow exponentially in the near term, opportunity abounds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While the potential is enticing to any prospector, automotive companies, whose futures hang in the balance of these outcomes, have proven to be some of the most active investors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Automakers are uniquely positioned to gauge which EV, AV or connected car startups stand a legitimate chance of succeeding, and they have the resources to make meaningful investments. Plus, having an early stake in companies that could be acquired down the road, adds a valuable asset to their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, &lt;a href="https://www.alliance-2022.com/" target="new"&gt;Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi&lt;/a&gt; are looking to leverage their collective power in the space by forming an investment alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On January 9, the three automakers announced the launch of a new venture capital fund named Alliance Ventures. Co-located in Paris, Yokohama, Beijing and Silicon Valley, Alliance Ventures will invest up to $1 billion over the next five years in "technology and business model innovation" for electric cars, autonomous vehicles, connected cars, and other newly emerging forms of mobility. The fund plans to invest $200 million of that sum in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Our open innovation approach will allow us to invest and collaborate with start-up companies and technology entrepreneurs, who will benefit from the global scale of the Alliance," Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/renault-nissan-mitsubishi-launches-a-venture-capital-fund-to-invest-up-to-1-billion-over-five-years-668507643.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "This new fund reflects the collaborative spirit and entrepreneurial mind-set at the heart of the Alliance."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When it launched the fund, Alliance Ventures also revealed its first investment, in Massachusetts battery company &lt;a href="http://ionicmaterials.com/" target="new"&gt;Ionic Materials&lt;/a&gt;. Along with acquiring equity in the company, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi has established a cooperative R&amp;D arrangement with Ionic Materials. The battery maker specializes in designing solid-state, cobalt-free batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We can fix lithium-ion to be safe and do all the advanced things people want to do. But we can also make [alkaline batteries that are] cheaper and safer and simple to manufacture, and make them rechargeable," Sun Microsystems founder and Ionic Materials investor Bill Joy told &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40453858/can-ionic-materials-design-a-rechargeable-battery-that-unseats-the-lithium-ion" target="new"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance was founded in 1999 as the Renault-Nissan Alliance. In October, Nissan acquired a $2.3 billion, one-third stake in Mitsubishi, which subsequently joined the Alliance. For Alliance Ventures, Renault and Nissan each hold a 40% stake, while Mitsubishi has a 20% stake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;New investment funds focused on the future of the automotive industry have become increasingly popular.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In September, Chinese tech giant and autonomous vehicle developer &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/21/baidu-announces-1-5b-fund-to-back-self-driving-car-startups/" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; and South Korean electronics company &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/samsung-launches-300m-autonomous-driving-fund-puts-90m-into-tttech/" target="new"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; each launched investment funds that targeted AV companies. Two months prior, the VC firm &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/13/autotech-ventures-closes-120-million-first-fund-to-connect-automotive-giants-with-emerging-startups/" target="new"&gt;Autotech Ventures&lt;/a&gt; closed a $120 million fund with the express purpose of connecting promising automotive startups with investors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance currently accounts for one in nine vehicles sold worldwide. By making strategic investments in promising automotive startups, the Alliance is making a long-term play to widen its slice of that pie.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, a self-driving car could operate using only a suite of sensors that detected objects such as other cars, pedestrians, and road markings. It would, however, be incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The sensors would need to perform at a higher level than they are currently capable of and could not slip in performance in adverse driving conditions. And every time a driverless car traveled a route it would be as if it was doing so for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That is why so much work is being done in the realm of HD mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Building digital, three-dimensional road maps for autonomous systems is the ideal companion to sensors, with each making the other's job easier. But building these maps is no easy feat either. Mapping all the world's roads at a high resolution is an enormous task, and that's without even mentioning the fact that these maps need to be continually updated to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mobileye.com/en-us/" target="new"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt;, the Israeli automotive sensor company &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735423" target="new"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" target="new"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; for $15.3 billion last year, may be approaching a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At CES, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that 2 million vehicles from BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen are now equipped with Mobileye technology to perform the data collection necessary to build three-dimensional maps for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We believe that crowdsourcing is the only solution," said Mobileye CEO and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who Krzanich brought on stage during his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlJ9zB74G_U" target="new"&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt; speech. "Cars equipped with Mobileye cameras and chips act as data collectors, as harvesters. They continuously update high-definition maps, and we call this data collection Road Experience Management, or REM."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the past, most mapping was done from the top down -- think Google Street View vehicles that systematically map neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What Intel's approach does is to transform any car equipped with Mobileye's technology into a mapping device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The data that will be used to generate these maps will be harvested by Mobileye 8 Connect, the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that provides safety technology to drivers and connectivity features to fleet owners. Remarkably, the system that will build these maps -- which can be retrofitted onto any car -- consists of just a single camera sensor and the so-called "EyeQ" processing system that accompanies it. In retrofitted cars, this system sits on the exterior of the windshield.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;According to Mobileye, its uses extend beyond consumer and private sector applications. Cities also could generate incredibly valuable data from Mobileye 8 Connect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NfqVpTFFSXo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Not only does it provide lifesaving warnings to the driver, it also silently observes and collects critical and actionable data for your city," the company said in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfqVpTFFSXo" target="new"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. "With expected applications like traffic light and sign identification, infrastructure deficiency and accident hotspot detection, and even free parking space recognition, Mobileye 8 Connect can be a key element in making your city safer and smarter."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With Mobileye 8 Connect expected to launch later later this year, Intel is on a path toward becoming the leader in 3D HD maps for autonomous vehicles, which could make it an increasingly necessary partner for all AV developers.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) group released the non-standalone (NSA) 5G radio specifications, the first official standard for 5G networks. This also includes an anchor for LTE.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1930-sys_architecture"target="new"&gt;A standalone standard&lt;/a&gt; (Release 15) for 5G is expected in June, according to &lt;a href="http://www.3gpp.org/"target="new"&gt;3GPP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once the world has the new generation of connectivity in place and all cars and vehicles are equipped with Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies -- something that should happen by 2025 -- common sights on the road today, such as traffic lights and posted speed limits, will become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The initial standards for Cellular V2X have been agreed to under the 3GPP Release 14, and called "LTE support for V2X." Commercial roll out is expected to commence this year.&lt;/p&gt;

  {Image 1}

  &lt;p&gt;Some services will appear at the Winter Olympics as South Korea's KT Telecom plans to have a 5G commercial network ready for the Pyeongchang Games in February.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The one issue that most industry stakeholders agree, as they confirmed in several sessions during Mobile World Congress 2017, is that 5G is not initially a technology for people's handsets, but rather a way to connect the more than 20 billion devices that will be present by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The arrival of 5G standards opens the way for vehicles to be equipped with advanced technologies that require the security, performance and low latency of the new networks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In September 2016, car manufacturers and mobile technology players created the "&lt;a href="https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1330525"target="new"&gt;5G Automotive Association&lt;/a&gt;" to develop new offerings for autonomous vehicles using connected technologies, such as Cellular Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) communication. And the new connected cars, equipped with Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and V2X technologies, are expected to pack in around &lt;a href="https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;doc_id=1331919"target="new"&gt;$6,000 of electronics by 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The GSMA, which sponsors MWC, &lt;a href="https://www.gsma.com/iot/news/road-5g-rise-connected-cars/"target="new"&gt;predicted last year&lt;/a&gt; that annual sales of connections for automobiles will reach 91-million units by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The potential benefits are enormous, especially in reducing accident-related deaths and injuries. For example, the In-Vehicle Speed Limit Signaling could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847811000325"target="new"&gt;potentially reduce deaths&lt;/a&gt; by 15% and injuries by another 8%.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Traffic flow will be improved as navigation systems and apps can use the virtual network of vehicles to determine the flow of traffic and divert drivers to different routes to avoid congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;5G will also be key to launching fully autonomous vehicles. While the buzz about self-driving cars has subsided a bit last year, research continues at full speed. 5G connectivity is one of the key components to launch autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting advantages of connected cars using 5G is the potential launch of virtual cloud networks linking the vehicles in one area. The upcoming 5G networks will need a large number of cells to perform, as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency"target="new"&gt;mm-wave frequencies&lt;/a&gt; limit the range of transmission -- unless you want to stick your head in a massive microwave oven.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thousands of cars can become the carriers, connectors, and on-the-fly storage for 5G infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Security, obviously, is one of the main concerns. A network of highly-connected vehicles needs to be protected against hackers and other threats, such as network failures and natural disasters. That's why the &lt;a href="https://5g-ppp.eu/"target="new"&gt;European 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership&lt;/a&gt; (5GPPP) has been working simultaneously on 5G development and security implementation.&lt;/P&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://5gensure.eu/sites/default/files/5G%20PPP_White%20Paper_Phase%201%20Security%20Landscape_June%202017.pdf"target="new"&gt;paper published&lt;/a&gt; in June, the 5GPPP encourages its members to agree on several security technologies, such as Network Slicing, Microsegmentation, Strong Isolation, MTC Space and others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Members have identified the 555G PPP security landscape and privacy as a 5G enabler and essential value proposition supporting the principle of privacy by design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Today, mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) companies face a significant limiting factor: They need humans to drive the cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is not a new development, of course, but the rapid growth of the MaaS space has made this obvious reality a frequent topic of discussion. A ride-hailing service, for example, can only service as many customers as it has active drivers. The same goes for delivery companies, which can't maximize efficiency if there's a driver shortage at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Many believe that the emergence of self-driving cars will change all that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The logic is fairly simple: With tireless computer operating systems at the helm, self-driving cars will be able to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That constant operation of individual fleet vehicles figures to significantly raise the profit margin on each one, as will their ability to self-diagnose the need for maintenance exactly when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Early in January, &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="new"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; continued its future-facing push into the autonomous MaaS space with the announcement of a new partnership with online delivery service &lt;a href="https://postmates.com/" target="new"&gt;Postmates&lt;/a&gt;. Self-driving Fords will join Postmate's fleet of human drivers, making deliveries and collecting key data on customer experiences while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The news was first unveiled by Ford CEO Jim Hackett in a speech at CES 2018 in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2011, Postmates is a mobile app-based delivery platform on which customers can order any number of things, including "a burrito, new headphones, or a fresh shirt for tonight's date," according to the company's &lt;a href="https://help.postmates.com/hc/en-us/articles/220089107-What-can-I-have-delivered-with-Postmates-" target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  Much like Uber or Seamless, the app matches users with delivery personnel who procure and deliver the selected products. Customers receive an estimated delivery time and can track the status of their orders.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Throughout the year, Ford and Postmates will conduct pilot programs to explore how self-driving technology could change the delivery experience for consumers, enable brick-and-mortar retailers to reach new customer bases, and transform the way commerce moves in the communities in which we operate," Ford's vice president of Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification Sherif Marakby wrote in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/why-teaming-with-postmates-will-help-ford-expand-on-demand-delivery-to-everyone-c11739e76ba4" target="new"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt;. "In the future, when a consumer uses Postmates to place a purchase  -- whether for groceries, takeout or other goods -- a self-driving vehicle could be what delivers her order. As part of our testing trials, we'll study both what the merchant experience needs to be at the point of delivery and what the customer experience needs to be at that same point."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Postmates joins &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735861" target="new"&gt;Domino's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736849" target="new"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; as users of Ford's self-driving partnership platform, which, according to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/coming-to-a-city-near-you-test-driving-our-autonomous-vehicle-business-27a05a2b082e" target="new"&gt;Ford vice president and president of Global Markets Jim Farley&lt;/a&gt;, plans to expand to service more businesses and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We want all types of businesses and organizations, including non-profit service providers and even individuals, to have equal opportunity to expand and enhance their role in the community," wrote Farley.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Having high-profile companies like Domino's, Lyft and Postmates is a natural first step. But if Ford delivers on its goals of helping smaller, mom-and-pop companies, it could scale up its operations in places beyond urban centers and establish itself in an even more dominant position.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In March 2017, Samsung acquired Harman International for $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It was a hefty sum, but the move was a way for &lt;a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/" target="new"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; to instantly gain greater access into the automotive sector, where &lt;a href="http://www.harman.com/" target="new"&gt;Harman&lt;/a&gt; was an established leader in electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With the rise of connected cars and the imminent arrival of self-driving cars, technology is largely the driving force behind automotives, and as one of the world's largest tech companies Samsung couldn't afford to not play a role in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Less than a year later, the industry is seeing some of the first products emerge from the partnership partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At this years's CES, Samsung and Harman unveiled three new products for connected and driverless cars: a digital cockpit platform, a 5G automotive telematics solution and an autonomous driving platform known as DRVLINE. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Leveraging the power of Harman's &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=735132" target="new"&gt;Ignite platform&lt;/a&gt;, the new cockpit solution from Harman and Samsung empowers drivers with an interface perfectly suited for the next generation of automotives. All three levels of configuration -- low, medium and high -- offer cloud services to lower costs for the infotainment system, and even vehicle weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The premium configuration of the Digital Cockpit stands apart from similar products on the market today. Services such as virtual personal assistants and augmented reality can be integrated across as many as four displays. Plus, vehicle preference profiles can be taken from one vehicle to the next. That means that even though the ride-hailing and ride-sharing services may expand, a passenger utilizing the Digital Cockpit platform can still make every vehicle he enters feel like his own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The connected car, as game-changing as it has already been, is far from a complete product.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Many believed that the technology won't be fully maximized until 5G mobile connectivity is widespread. 5G networks promise incredibly fast connection speeds. Some experts believe they may even replace WiFi. But because industry standards for 5G are yet to be determined, companies have found it hard to prepare for this future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With its 5G automotive telematics solution, Samsung and Harman, however, have developed a product that can work with the LTE CAT 16 connectivity of today and be instantly ready for the 5G networks of tomorrow. With up to 1GB per second bandwidth, this telematics solution has the potential speed to enable the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) capabilities that will empower self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In designing its autonomous platform DRVLINE, Samsung and Harman wanted to create a future-proofed product.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to build an autonomous driving platform because the potential business from creating the one that becomes ubiquitous across all driverless cars is enormous. The problem is that no one is sure exactly what the technology of tomorrow will look like. With DRVLINE, Samsung and Harman claim to have developed software that is so versatile and customizable that it will be able to serve the AV sector as technology progresses towards Level 5 autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The industry has made incredible advances in automation, yet in-car compute is still a long way from approximating the power of our brains," Harman/Samsung executive John Absmeier wrote in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-reveals-drvline-platform-autonomous-future/" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The DRVLINE platform with its open and high-level compute capability is a first major first step toward building an ecosystem to support full autonomy."&lt;/p&gt;

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The position of legacy automakers is not as secure as it once was.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The impending arrival of self-driving cars has opened up the market, allowing major tech companies and startups to infiltrate an industry that once was the exclusive domain of OEMs. It's not totally infeasible that Google spinoff Waymo could become the leading American automaker in the second half of this century.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, legacy automakers still have an opportunity to expand their business. As the fleets of vehicles used for ride-sharing and ride-hailing services grow, no one is in a better position to produce the vehicles for those fleets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is the approach being adopted by &lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/" target="new"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than acting defensively, Toyota made clear its intentions to be a player in the fleet space at CES in January.&lt;/P&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The automaker introduced the e-Palette concept vehicle as a collaborative effort with Uber, Amazon, Mazda, Pizza Hut and ride-hailing company Didi. As the diversity of those partners suggests, e-Palette is a broad, ambitious concept that would aim to position Toyota at the center of a transformation in transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The automobile industry is clearly amidst its most dramatic period of change as technologies like electrification, connected and automated driving are making significant progress," Toyota president Akio Toyoda noted in a &lt;a href="http://pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+launches+new+mobility+ecosystem+concept+vehicle+2018+ces.htm" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Toyota remains committed to making ever better cars. Just as important, we are developing mobility solutions to help everyone enjoy their lives... This announcement marks a major step forward in our evolution towards sustainable mobility, demonstrating our continued expansion beyond traditional cars and trucks to the creation of new values including services for customers."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The e-Palette concept is fully autonomous and fully electric.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The idea is to offer an open-source platform for third parties to customize the vehicles to suit their exact needs. The vehicles are designed to be appealing to all types of fleet managers, whether it be those shuttling humans -- Uber and Didi -- or those shuttling goods, such as Amazon and Pizza Hut. Digital renderings of the vehicle from Toyota show other uses, as well: Mobile stores, restaurants and work spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As has become customary for autonomous concept vehicles, the e-Palette features a unique, quirky design. But the boxy-with-rounded-edges design is not whimsical for whimsy's sake. A barrier-free interior with a low floor allows for maximum space in the cabin, enabling a wide variety of possible uses. The concept includes three different lengths of e-Palette, which Toyota says could allow for a space large enough to serve as a hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The concept was the recipient of the inaugural &lt;a href="https://www.edmunds.com/" target="new"&gt;Edmunds&lt;/a&gt; CES Tech Driven Hackmotive Award.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Buzzwords like future mobility and autonomy reverberate throughout the show floor at CES, but Toyota's innovative e-Palette concept stands out from the crowd thanks to its near-term implementation, established partnerships and visionary execution," Edmunds editor-in-chief Alistair Weaver wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyota-e-palette-concept-wins-inaugural-edmunds-ces-tech-driven-hackomotive-award-at-ces-2018-300581014.html" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "The e-Palette concept vehicle embraces the transformative ideals of the Hackomotive Award and has real potential to help usher in a new era of transportation."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While its design may be different from what we see on our roads today, the versatility of the e-Palette could make it a hit among fleet owners with vehicles performing a variety of duties, and its roomy cabin could make it a hit among passengers, too.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most widely anticipated trend in the next few decades of automotives is a massive shift from private vehicle ownership toward ride-sharing services.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons for consumers to be excited about this, including costs savings and increased convenience. The demise of private car ownership, however, will rightfully be mourned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For all of the positives that come with ride sharing, there are still a lot of great things about owning a car. One of the biggest benefits is customization. When you have your own ride, you can tune every element to your exact preference. When you ride in a different, anonymous vehicle every time you make a trip, that's far from the case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harman.com/" target="new"&gt;Harman International&lt;/a&gt; wants to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At CES 2018 in Las Vegas, the Samsung subsidiary unveiled two new user experience solutions, known as Configurable Entertainment and Moodscape, that will allow passengers in equipped ride-hailing fleet vehicles to customize the in-vehicle settings exactly how they like them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"When it comes to their vehicles, today's consumers are all about the experience and are less concerned about the technology behind it. At Harman, we are constantly focused on innovating with the passenger in mind, integrating emerging technology with software-driven audio to provide the effortless, responsive experiences consumers have come to expect," Harman's president of lifestyle audio Michael Mauser wrote in a &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/new-harman-ux-solutions-deliver-unprecedented-in-car-comfort-and-entertainment-experiences-at-ces-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Moodscape and Configurable Entertainment are perfect examples of how we're reinventing what is possible in the vehicle today, as well as for the autonomous future."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Configurable Entertainment leverages Harman's industry-leading position in the automotive speakers space to offer passengers their preferred sound design for the specific media they're using. Someone riding in a Configurable Entertainment-equipped car could use JBL audio while gaming, or Harman Kardon audio while listening to music thanks to "shape-shifting speakers" that sound more like a Transformer than an audio component.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"In-vehicle speakers transform in real-time to provide different experiences in line with user preferences," according to the release. "A unique sound bar or tweeter can dynamically morph from one audio brand experience to another, both sonically and visually."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Moodscape is designed for passengers who are feeling stressed, contemplative, tired or energetic. Citing growing consumer interest in the "wellness" space, Harman developed Moodscape to adjust the emotions of a passenger. A feature known as Music Motivator "identifies GPS routes and analyzes available biometric feedback to build and deliver an audio experience based on passengers' whereabouts, schedule and energy level."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the coolest feature of Moodscape is the so-called QLED MoodRoof, which projects an immersive environment onto the car's internal ceiling. While you actually may be riding through downtown Boston, MoodRoof can make it feel as if you're being guided through a snowy forest or a sunny beach town depending on your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Part of the joy of driving home after a long day is being in your own personal space. As consumers transition toward making that drive in a ride-hailing vehicle, Harman is trying to preserve that idea of personal space with Configurable Entertainment and Moodscape. While a passenger may not own the car, he or she can still own the experience.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The primary function of a car is to convey a passenger from from Point A to Point B. But the automobile also happens to be extremely well-suited for entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Take music, for example. Most people no longer have Hi-Fi systems in their homes and listen to music primarily through either headphones or small Bluetooth speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Cars, on the other hand, have numerous speakers and can create a true surround sound experience that enhances the listening experience. Connected cars take the experience even further, with network connectivity-enabled location services that allow drivers and passengers to learn about the area they're driving in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are, however, limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One is the size of the screen mounted in a vehicle's dashboard. While home TVs have grown ever larger, infotainment screens in cars, with the exception of Tesla, have remained rather small.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.byton.com/index.html" target="new"&gt;Byton,&lt;/a&gt; which is based in China, is looking to change that. The company introduced the Byton Concept at CES earlier this month, and one of the most noticeable features of the luxury car was its 49-inch "shared experience display" that spanned the entire dashboard from the left edge of the driver's side to the right end of the passenger side.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The display screen serves as a massive infotainment center, allowing drivers to access navigation, communication or entertainment features -- or, given the screen's size and multi-function capabilities, all three at once.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The design goes above and beyond the traditional luxury vehicle, offering features and amenities that may seem more fitting in first-class air travel.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Sit back, relax and feel at home," reads the &lt;a href="https://www.byton.com/concept.html" target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the concept car. "Inviting color concepts, luxury materials and traditional craftsmanship blend with flair to give a bespoke lounge experience. All our seats are designed to be individually adjustable so you can stay cozy at all times."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Byton is currently manufacturing an intelligent electric car in Nanjing that will first be made available in China in 2019, and then in the US and Europe in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Subsequent vehicles expected from Byton include a sedan and a multi-purpose vehicle, which figure to include certain design elements from the Concept. While some of the vehicle's more opulent features may seem excessive, they're tailored to a specific market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Driving is not always very pleasureful in China, and most of the time you're not moving," Byton executive director of UI design Wolfram Luchner told Sean O'Kane of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/1/9/16867332/byton-electric-ev-car-ride-first-look-test-touchscreen-ces-2018" target="new"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;. "If you spend four or five hours a day in traffic, you'll want these comforts."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Byton Concept is equipped with several other cool features.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The dashboard-spanning screen is joined by a small eight-inch screen mounted right into the center of the steering wheel. The Byton Life Cloud Platform can sync contacts, apps and files from your smartphone with the vehicle's operating system. And keys aren't even necessary, as facial recognition cameras can provide access to the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Like all concept cars, the Byton Concept has design and operational elements that will likely never make it into a consumer vehicle. But the vehicle does show that China, which is emerging as an automotive power, particularly in the self-driving car space, isn't content to just make cars that can function.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The country also wants to produce vehicles that look good, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And that will go a long way toward convincing consumers to shift allegiance from automaking countries like the US, Germany and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The automobile has always represented an appealing space for advertisers primarily because it is home to a captive audience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With television, advertisers rightly worry that their targeted viewers will go to the bathroom, grab a snack, read their phones or simply fast forward with their DVR during a commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Drivers, with their attention necessarily focused on the road ahead of them, have no such alternatives. They can always change the radio station or fast forward their podcast, but that forces them to be distracted from their primary task -- driving -- and they are generally more content to simply listen to the ad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As technology has advanced and the emergence of the connected car has defined this decade in automotives, the car cockpit has grown substantially more appealing to marketers. The specificity, relevance and customization that marketers can offer on connected car platforms can make their ads all the more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That was the thinking behind &lt;a href="https://www.telenav.com/" target="new"&gt;Telenav&lt;/a&gt; recently launching a connected in-car advertising platform for automakers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Telenav's offering consists of a connected software system that will actually serve the ads in vehicles as well as the rest of the in-car advertising value chain. This means that, for automotive OEM clients, Telenav will perform everything from ad targeting to ad sales to campaign management, in addition to the delivery of the ads themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Connected, intelligent cars provide OEMs with new opportunities to roll out innovative features and services," Telenav CEO HP Jin noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.telenav.com/press-releases/2018-january-4" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Telenav's In-Car Advertising Platform provides an exciting new opportunity for OEMs to monetize connectivity to cover service costs and even drive healthy profits while enriching the consumer experience with safely-delivered, engaging and relevant offers."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Relevant is a key term here, and perhaps the most significant value add that Telenav promises over existing in-vehicle advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Leveraging information provided by the connected car ecosystem like geographic location, destinations, and frequently traveled routes, Telenav's system can improve the likelihood that ads will appeal to the drivers that are hearing them. A driver heading home in the evening, for example, could be prompted with a coupon offering a discount for a family-sized pizza deal. Gas stations could choose to target advertisements towards nearby vehicles that are running low on fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Safety is another critical component of Telenav's platform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737102" target="new"&gt;study by AAA&lt;/a&gt; showed that most existing infotainment systems can be dangerously distracting for drivers. That won't be so with ads served by Telenav. Ads will only appear when a vehicle is at a full stop, and will automatically disappear when a driver propels the car into motion or interacts with other elements of the infotainment system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ads can still be annoying, and undoubtedly the connected car advertising systems of the future will upset a few drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, if there's one thing that makes being sold something more tolerable, it's the fact that the item being sold is actually something you need. And that is exactly what Telenav is offering with its new in-car ad platform.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;At CES 2018 in Las Vegas, Nvidia -- one of the leading software and hardware companies in the driverless vehicle space -- made it clear that it doesn't take its industry-leading position in autonomous vehicle systems lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Now, we've built PCs, laptops, game consoles, supercomputers and I can tell you, without exception, building a computer for autonomous vehicles is of a level of complexity the world has never known," CEO Jensen Huang &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/01/07/nvidia-captures-pole-position-at-ces-amid-flurry-of-auto-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; a crowd of over 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"This computer is on all the time, monitoring all of the sensors that are coming at it," he added. "It can never fail -- it can never fail -- because lives are at stake. And it has to make the right decision, running software the world has never known how to write."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Big-time computing capabilities are an under-appreciated aspect of the self-driving car. Nvidia &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/uber-selects-nvidia-technology-to-power-its-self-driving-fleets" target="new"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; autonomous vehicles will require 50 to 100 times as much computing power as the connected cars of today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it appears that many in the autonomous vehicle space think Nvidia is up to the challenge. At CES, Huang announced that Nvidia now has a staggering 320 partnerships with other companies in the self-driving car category. While many of the collaborations were previously known, this was the first time Nvidia itself had released a complete tally of them all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nvidia also took the opportunity to announce four more collaborations. The company revealed new deals with &lt;a href="http://uber.com/" target="new"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://volkswagen.com/en.html" target="new"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.zf.com/corporate/en_de/homepage/homepage.html" target="new"&gt;ZF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Baidu_Inc?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index" target="new"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Uber first launched its self-driving Volvo XC90s on Pittsburgh roads in 2015, it used Nvidia GPU computing technology. Now as Uber expands its fleet of self-driving cars and fleet trucks, it will continue to utilize Nvidia technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Volkswagen plans to leverage the Nvidia Drive IX platform, an AI software development kit, to transform cockpit experiences for drivers and create improved safety features. Features built through Nvidia Drive IX will be incorporated in the forthcoming I.D. Bus, Volkswagen's electric, AI-infused re-imagining of the classic VW Microbus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the car," &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/volkswagen-and-nvidia-to-infuse-ai-into-future-vehicle-lineup" target="new"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess. "Autonomous driving, zero-emission mobility and digital networking are virtually impossible without advances in AI and deep learning. Combining the imagination of Volkswagen with Nvidia, the leader in AI technology, enables us to take a big step into the future."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Nvidia-ZF-Baidu project is a tricontinental one, as the California software company will be working with the German auto supplier and the Chinese tech giant to combine their proprietary AV technologies to build a single China-specific autonomous vehicle platform. The technologies involved are ZF's ProAI car computer, Baidu's Apollo open driverless platform, and the newly announced Nvidia Drive Xavier, an autonomous machine processor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nvidia also announced a deal with Mercedes-Benz. Similar to its project with Volkswagen, Nvidia is partnering with Mercedes-Benz to build a new vehicle cockpit experience, known as MBUX, designed for the driverless age.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"I want to build the world's most advanced cockpit of the future and it's going to have amazing computer graphics but most important is that it will have artificial intelligence so it can revolutionize the user experience," &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/01/09/mercedes-ces-2018/" target="new"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Huang.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It's an overwhelming list of projects for Nvidia, and one that will require time to fully work through. But given the stature of the company's partners, it's safe to say that no roundup of CES "winners" in 2018 will be complete without the inclusion of Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Remember Google Glass?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Long before augmented reality was a widely understood term, it seemed that everyone with an interest in consumer tech couldn't wait to get their hands on a pair of the glasses, which promised to help facilitate navigation, communication and entertainment for users on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Beta testers, known as "Explorers," were the first to try out Google Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it didn't go so well. Users earned the nickname "Glassholes," and the nerdy aesthetic of the glasses made it so few people were particularly enthusiastic about wearing them in public.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Google Glass never became the ubiquitous wearable the company expected. (The wearable did, however, find a &lt;a href="https://www.x.company/glass/" target="new"&gt;second life&lt;/a&gt; as a high-tech industrial tool.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One moral of the story is this: Design matters. A lot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Right now, most autonomous vehicles feature hulking sensor suites on their roofs. Developers are more focused on making sure the sensors and other technology actually work than with aesthetics.&lt;/P&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That is fine in the early stages of the development process. But at a certain point in the not too distant future, the look of an autonomous vehicle is going to play an increasingly important role in customers' decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The latest driverless prototype from the &lt;a href="http://www.tri.global/" target="new"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; (TRI) embraces this idea. At CES, Toyota unveiled a sleek Platform 3.0 autonomous concept vehicle that looks markedly different from other self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Built on the body of a Lexus LS 600hL, Platform 3.0 is founded upon three core principles: Industry-leading performance, a design that can be reproduced at scale and a distinct, sleek design that consumers want to be seen in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Our team has once again rapidly advanced our automated vehicle research capabilities," TRI CEO Gill Pratt wrote in a &lt;a href="http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota+research+institute+introduces+next+generation+automated+driving+research+vehicle+ces.htm" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "To elevate our test platform to a new level, we tapped Toyota's design and engineering expertise to create an all-new test platform that has the potential to be a benchmark in function and style."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To combat driverless cars' reputation for unsightly rooftop sensor suites that make even the clunkiest roof rack look aesthetically pleasing, TRI worked with designers at Toyota design studio CALTY Design Research to develop a more visually appealing design alternative. They dubbed their philosophy "intelligent minimalism," using available sunroof space to lower the overall height of the car's embedded sensor systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Automotive designers' roles have been pivoting toward thinking deeper and greater on how to design and apply automated driving technology for drivers and passengers," Scott Roller, senior lead designer at CALTY, noted in the release. "It's exciting to integrate the components in harmony with the car's design."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Platform 3.0 is more than just a design exercise. The concept car boasts performance benchmarks like 360-degree perception that extends 200 meters, and Lidar design and positioning that makes it easier for the vehicle to detect dark objects, small objects and low-level objects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While plenty of autonomous driving concepts were paraded around at CES this year, few were as pretty as TRI's Platform 3.0. As engineers continue to work to improve the system, the concept is set to soon have brains that match its impressive beauty.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;In many ways the march toward driverless cars is in lockstep with the march toward improved Lidar sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The industry leader, &lt;a href="http://velodynelidar.com/" target="new"&gt;Velodyne&lt;/a&gt; -- the same company that &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737882" target="new"&gt;pioneered&lt;/a&gt; Lidar in autonomous vehicles -- continues to raise the bar. The company recently unveiled a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738731" target="new"&gt;new sensor&lt;/a&gt; with 128 laser channels and &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739387" target="new"&gt;halved the price&lt;/a&gt; for its most popular sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But there are plenty of other outfits out there trying to chase Velodyne down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Lidar startup &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739058" target ="new"&gt;Ouster&lt;/a&gt; recently emerged from stealth mode with $27 million in funding and a high-performance sensor that it touts as lightweight and affordable. &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739131" target="new"&gt;TetraVue&lt;/a&gt; raised $10 million earlier this year on the strength of its flash Lidar, which the company believes outperforms traditional Lidar. Even &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738551" target="new"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has been looking for ways to optimize the technology's performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges to Velodyne's Lidar supremacy is &lt;a href="https://innoviz.tech/" target="new"&gt;Innoviz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2016, the Israeli company quickly rose to prominence with solid-state Lidar offerings known for performance, reliability and affordability. After &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/innoviz-technologies-announces-after-market-lidar-solution-innovizpro-collaborates-with-jabil-on-development-and-deployment-300462173.html" target="new"&gt;an initial announcement&lt;/a&gt; in May of last year, Innoviz recently released its long-awaited InnovizPro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Solid-state Lidar is widely viewed as the future of the sensor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Integrating all of the Lidar functionality into a single microchip eliminates the mechanical parts which are prone to failure. Since one of the biggest concerns with all Lidar sensors is their price, autonomous vehicle developers aren't going to want to invest in one that could break down faster. By creating a reliable solid-state sensor and cutting the cost, Innoviz co-founder and CEO Omar Keilaf believes he has a solution the market will love.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"InnovizPro provides immediate accessibility to our advanced Lidar technology and marks a giant leap forward for the entire autonomous vehicle market," Keilaf noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.oemoffhighway.com/electronics/sensors/press-release/20987677/innoviz-technologies-innoviz-technologies-launches-innovizpro-highresolution-solidstate-lidar-solution" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We are addressing a major need for high-resolution scanning technology at lower cost, with no minimum order required."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In November, it was announced that the InnovizPro had received the CES 2018 Innovation Award for Vehicle Intelligence and Self-Driving Technology. The company accepted the award in Las Vegas at CES 2018 in January. According &lt;a href="https://ces18.mapyourshow.com/7_0/exhibitor/exhibitor-details.cfm?ExhID=T0008010" target="new"&gt;to CES&lt;/a&gt;, InnovizPro's honor means it met "the highest standards for outstanding product design and engineering as judged by a panel of highly respected experts in their field."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The award comes on the heels of news that &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delphi-partners-with-innoviz-technologies-to-provide-high-performance-lidar-solutions-for-autonomous-vehicles-300506535.html" target="new"&gt;Aptiv&lt;/a&gt; (previously Delphi Automotive) and &lt;a href="http://www.eenewsanalog.com/news/magna-joins-delphi-backing-innoviz-0" target="new"&gt;Magna International&lt;/a&gt; had established separate partnerships to utilize Innoviz's sensor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In October, Innoviz closed a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/innoviz-technologies-extends-series-b-funding-to-73-million-300546221.html" target="new"&gt;$73 million&lt;/a&gt; Series B funding round that included major contributions from Aptiv and Magna.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the leaders in the autonomous vehicle race is a never-ending process. Like an actual sporting contest, there are favorites and underdogs, and plenty of movement in and out of both camps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Google spinoff &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; is unquestionably in the favorites category. This year, Waymo will become the first company to test driverless cars on public roads without a human attendant, and the first company to launch a &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; featuring autonomous vehicles exclusively. If Waymo is 1, then GM's autonomous division &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="new"&gt;Cruise Automation&lt;/a&gt; is 1-A, with &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737210" target="new"&gt;100 driverless cars&lt;/a&gt; many self-driving cars operating in the hectic &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737053" target="new"&gt;streets of San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and more coming soon to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=737461" target="new"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a tendency to think of companies such as Waymo, GM and other leaders in the space -- Uber and Tesla -- as singular entities. But the reality is that these are multi-faceted organizations with lots of employees. And as the market for driverless cars has heated up, many of those employees have left big companies to launch their own startups.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While these startups may be smaller in size, they still have huge ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That is certainly the case with &lt;a href="https://aurora.tech/" target="new"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Palo Alto outfit has an impressive trio of co-founders, including former Tesla Autopilot leader Sterling Anderson, former head of Google self-driving Chris Urmson, and former Uber AV engineer Drew Bagnell.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Up until the start of the year, Aurora had been operating mostly in stealth mode, but the company kicked off 2018 with &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2018/01/04/from-stealth-to-stardom-ex-google-tesla-uber-robocar-icons-snag-vw-hyundai-deals/#6d586a9a1a65" target="new"&gt;a major announcement&lt;/a&gt; that it was working with both Hyundai and Volkswagen to power the automakers' impending autonomous vehicle projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With a sparse website (motto: "We do self-driving cars") that displays a long list of &lt;a href="https://aurora.tech/openings.html#apply" target="new"&gt;job openings&lt;/a&gt; in Palo Alto, San Francisco and Pittsburgh, Aurora isn't exactly shouting from the rooftops about its driverless system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Volkswagen's announcement of its partnership with the company, though, provides an idea of what the AV veterans Anderson, Urmson and Bagnell have up their sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Specialists from the Volkswagen Group ... have already been working intensively with experts from Aurora to integrate Aurora's self-driving system including sensors, hardware and software, such as Machine Learning and AI technology in Volkswagen Group's vehicle platforms," reads the &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/releases/967" target="new"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;. "With the customer experience at the center of this technology development, the Volkswagen Group is focused on creating new solutions, with the goal of providing best-in-class user experience with a focus on safety, convenience and usability."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Volkswagen plans to leverage Aurora's technology to build upon its &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=736552" target="new"&gt;Sedric concept&lt;/a&gt;. First unveiled in March of 2017, Sedric will represent a "family" of fully autonomous vehicles of various purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While Aurora's work with Volkswagen reportedly has been ongoing for about a year, the company's engagement with Hyundai is a more recent development. Hyundai says its goal in working with Aurora is to have Level 4 autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At Level 4 autonomy, a driverless system is expected to complete the entirety of most standard drives on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The question that remains is how close is Aurora to catching its founders' former employers. The Volkswagen and Hyundai news is certainly encouraging. In the future it may not be necessary, or even desirable, for every automaker to have its own autonomous vehicle platform. So collaborating with a third party that provides off-the-shelf solutions like Aurora makes a lot of sense. Volkswagen, for one, seems to see this as just the beginning of an ongoing and fruitful relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Long-term probably only a handful of companies will actually be setting the standard and developing a self-driving system which actually can be delivered into many OEM's vehicles. I personally believe [Aurora] will be one of these," Volkswagen Group Chief Digital Officer Johann Jungwirth told Forbes. "Until now Aurora hasn't been open yet for outside investment. We are very open to that and interested in that. That's all I can say at this time."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Tragically, many serious auto accidents were only milliseconds away from being prevented.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Piloting a multi-ton automobile is a game of inches, especially at high speeds. The difference between a major collision and a close call can be the amount of time between when a driver thinks about hitting the brakes or turning the wheel, and the time it takes him or her to actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bridging such a minuscule physiological gap is a daunting challenge. But the so-called "Brain-to-Vehicle" (B2V) technology, which &lt;a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated for the first time at CES 2018 in Las Vegas, attempts to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The product involves brain-wave reading skullcaps, which drivers wear behind the wheel. Paired with intelligent predictive software, Nissan's B2V tech can anticipate a driver's next move, whether it be acceleration, braking or turning. The vehicle can then begin that action before the driver even hits a pedal or turns the steering wheel. Nissan claims the tech makes a difference of 0.2 to 0.5 seconds in performing a given action, "while remaining largely imperceptible."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The B2V moniker is a reference to connected car technologies like vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity. V2V connectivity allows cars to "talk" to one another on the road, telegraphing their intentions to create more predictable -- and therefore safer -- traffic patterns. V2I connectivity refers to communication between cars and a central grid to optimize on-road operations like the patterns of traffic lights. Many believe that V2X (vehicle-to-everything) connectivity will be essential to the functioning of fully self-driving cars, and Nissan claims its B2V tech will factor into that equation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"When most people think about autonomous driving, they have a very impersonal vision of the future, where humans relinquish control to the machines. Yet B2V technology does the opposite, by using signals from their own brain to make the drive even more exciting and enjoyable," Nissan Executive Vice President Daniele Schillaci said in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-3459ed449767a2e07b2e465ced0014bc-180103-01-e" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Through Nissan Intelligent Mobility, we are moving people to a better world by delivering more autonomy, more electrification and more connectivity."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Nissan Intelligent Mobility program, of which B2V is a part of, is an initiative through which Nissan strives to embrace and integrate the most futuristic automotive technology into its vehicles. Other technologies that have come out of Nissan Intelligent Mobility include ProPilot Park, an advanced automated parking system, and e-Pedal, which integrates both acceleration and braking into a single pedal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are both limits and theoretical concerns about Nissan's B2V product.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One involves finding a home for the hardware powering the advanced technology inside the vehicle. There are also issues involved with convincing drivers to actually don a wired skullcap every time they get behind the wheel. Then there's the concern about what would happen if the technology faltered and ended up causing an accident instead of preventing one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But as unusual as brain wave-reading hats might appear, the concept of a vehicle using biometric data to anticipate a driver's actions has enormous potential. If a vehicle can augment human capacities to allow them to perform better than they would on their own, that is certainly a technology worth exploring further.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;As the global market for self-driving cars matures over the next decade-plus, China represents an enormous business opportunity for autonomous vehicle developers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With the world's largest population and a relatively recent explosion in automobile ownership and usage, the Chinese market is expected to be the largest single global market for driverless cars for the foreseeable future. A &lt;a href="http://news.ihsmarkit.com/press-release/automotive/autonomous-vehicle-sales-surpass-33-million-annually-2040-enabling-new-auto" target="new"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt; from IHS Markit predicted that China will account for 14.5 million of the 33 million autonomous vehicle sales in the year 2040, nearly twice as much as the next closest country. And China's &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739301" target="new"&gt;recent move&lt;/a&gt; to allow the testing of self-driving cars on public roads suggests an eagerness to accelerate the development and implementation of these vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For those reasons, &lt;a href="https://us.blackberry.com/" target="new"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; recently became the envy of the autonomous driving world when it announced a large-scale partnership with tech giant &lt;a href="http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=188488&amp;amp;p=irol-irhome" target="new"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate on various components of the Chinese company's driverless car projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Of the several initiatives on which the companies will work together, the foremost will be BlackBerry contributing its QNX operating system as a foundation for Baidu's Apollo open autonomous driving platform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"BlackBerry QNX has established itself as the OS platform for safety-certified production-based systems," Li Zhenyu, general manager of Baidu's Intelligent Driving Group, noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/blackberry-baidu-partnering-accelerate-connected-autonomous-vehicle-technology-nyse-bb-2244030.htm" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We aim to provide automakers with a clear and fast path to fully autonomous vehicle production, with safety and security as top priorities. By integrating the BlackBerry QNX OS with the Apollo platform, we will enable carmakers to leap from prototype to production systems. Together, we will work toward a technological and commercial ecosystem for autonomous driving, intelligent connectivity, and intelligent traffic systems."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Apollo is perhaps the world's best-known autonomous driving platform, partly because it is open-source and has drawn contributors ranging from independent developers to the most prominent tech companies and automakers in the driverless car space.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Baidu frequently makes a point to tout its long list of collaborators, which include companies like Ford, Velodyne and Intel. Baidu &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=734772" target="new"&gt;works with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, incorporating its Azure platform to power Apollo's cloud computing elements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Baidu connected car smartphone integration system CarLife and conversational AI system DuerOS will also both be incorporated into the BlackBerry QNX infotainment platform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Joining forces with Baidu will enable us to explore integration opportunities for multiple vehicle subsystems including ADAS, infotainment, gateways, and cloud services," said BlackBerry Senior Vice President John Wall.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While BlackBerry may best be known by the average American consumer for its cellular devices that dominated the early smartphone market, the Canadian company has since become a major player in cybersecurity and telematics, particularly with regards to connected and driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-baidu/blackberry-surges-on-deal-with-baidu-for-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1ES15V" target="new"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, this partnership with Baidu represents one of BlackBerry's biggest moves in recent years, and the company's stock rose to its highest close since March 2013 in the wake of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that market predictions need to be taken with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The reality is that no one can see the future, and with so many variables affecting industry trends, all prognostications come with a healthy margin of error. This is particularly true with emerging industries where the data set around which market predictions are made is relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But hitting a number exactly on the head isn't the point of these reports. Instead, they exist to show where a particular market may be headed in broad strokes. The predictions are based on more than throwing darts at a board and even if the prophecies don't come true, they still provide a trove of useful insight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is through that lens that a recent report from &lt;a href="https://ihsmarkit.com/" target="new"&gt;IHS Markit&lt;/a&gt; should be viewed. The global information and analytics company explored the future of the self-driving car industry and forecasted that more than 33 million autonomous vehicles will be sold by 2040. According to IHS Markit's analysts, the AV revolution will start long before that -- but it won't begin with individual consumer ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The first autonomous vehicle volumes -- beyond retrofit test vehicles -- will arrive in 2019 through driverless mobility services," Egil Juliussen, director of automotive technology research at IHS Markit, wrote in the &lt;a href="http://news.ihsmarkit.com/press-release/automotive/autonomous-vehicle-sales-surpass-33-million-annually-2040-enabling-new-auto" target="new"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. "Volumes will surpass 51,000 units in 2021 when personally owned autonomous cars reach individual buyers for the first time, and IHS Markit forecasts estimate nearly 1 million units will be sold in 2025 across shared fleets and individually owned cars."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This projected trend is in line with the common belief that fleet vehicles will account for the overwhelming majority of self-driving cars when the technology first hits the market. Without the need for a human driver, autonomous vehicles operating within ride-hailing services will be able to run 24/7. Fleet managers will need to take advantage of this increased uptime to justify the added expense that will come with the first wave of self-driving cars. As the technology costs come down so will vehicle costs, which will then expand the market for the driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicle sales in the US, China and Europe will account for approximately 27 million of those 33 million annual sales, according to IHS.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;China is expected to be the leader in total volume at 14.5 million units, which is influenced by the fact that its enormous population could top 1.5 billion people by 2040. The US could account for 7.4 million units per year by that point, thanks to hosting the world's foremost AV developers. And while sales in Europe could be hampered by regulations that discourage ride-hailing services from operating, IHS Markit still predicts 5.5 million annual vehicle sales across the continent by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While 2040 may seem far away, IHS Markit analyst Jeremy Carlson cited &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/" target="new"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;'s forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=738058" target="new"&gt;AV ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix as evidence that many Americans will have the opportunity to ride in a driverless car much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We as consumers are going to start to get hands-on experience much sooner than expected," Carlson told &lt;a href="http://www.thedrive.com/sheetmetal/17298/forecast-autonomous-vehicle-sales-to-top-33-million-in-2040" target="new"&gt;The Drive&lt;/a&gt;. "Consumers are going to get exposure in a handful of cities to start with."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Those early consumer experiences are one of the factors that could contribute significantly to whether or not that 33 million statistic comes true or not.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;The rise of voice assistants such as the Alexa-powered Amazon Echo in recent years has shown the viability of artificial intelligence in the home. It's no secret why.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ability to manifest a thought by simply speaking it out loud is an incredibly powerful, and frictionless, experience. You can put on your favorite music without scrolling through a streaming app. You can set up a reminder for yourself without entering it into a calendar. You can add an item to your grocery list without having a physical grocery list. You can even &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; those very groceries all by uttering a single sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you think about it, though, the home is not even the place where a voice assistant has the most potential. Sure, it's a convenience, but putting down what you're doing for a second to perform a task on your computer or phone isn't the worst thing in the world. When you're driving a car, however, a few taps on your phone can become a matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That's why many experts believe that automobiles represent a more significant growth space for voice assistant technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/" target="new"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kia.com/us/en/home" target="new"&gt;Kia&lt;/a&gt; certainly do. The South Korean automakers both plan to launch artificial intelligence-based voice assistant services in select new vehicles beginning in 2019, with a goal of including the technology in all new vehicles by the year 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The automakers, which are both part of Hyundai Motor Group, are currently developing a product known as Intelligent Personal Agent that will perform tasks in and out of the vehicle, as well as give users requested information like weather and traffic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Sophisticated voice recognition and AI integration are core to effectively providing drivers with the massive content and data that future connected vehicles have to offer," Hyundai director of infotainment development Paul Choo wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2449" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "These elements play a key role in delivering connected-car-generated information."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The project is a collaboration with AI company &lt;a href="https://soundhound.com/" target="new"&gt;SoundHound&lt;/a&gt;, and will be based upon the preexisting Houndify platform. The Houndify &lt;a href="https://www.houndify.com/" target="new"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; touts capabilities like "deep meaning understanding," "conversational intelligence" and multilingual text to speech. Companies that already offer products based on the Houndify platform include Yelp, Uber and Expedia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"We spent a decade developing Houndify, the most advanced voice AI platform, to enable partners the ability to create customized experiences for their products," SoundHound founder and CEO Keyvan Mohajer noted. "We are thrilled to work with Hyundai Motor to revolutionize the in-car experience."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Much like Amazon Echo owners get the attention of their device with the prompt of "Alexa," future Hyundai owners will activate their car's AI system with the simple phrase "Hi, Hyundai." The list of functions will be extensive. Using their voice, drivers will be able to open and close car doors and change the temperature inside the vehicle. They'll be able to control infotainment systems, setting the destination for a navigation system or queuing up a favorite podcast. They'll even be able to remotely control IoT-connected items in their home like thermostats or security systems. More services are expected to be added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In advance of the 2019 rollout, Hyundai and Kia demonstrated the new AI capabilities of the Intelligent Personal Agent at the CES trade show in Las Vegas in January.&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>

    <page_html>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the single greatest triumph of the connected car is location-based security services.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the GPS and telematics products that are commonly available for most new cars, car owners are able to track the location of their vehicle from cell phone apps. A would-be burglar driving what is effectively a moving tracking device will be caught in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These capabilities now extend to the sharing economy, with car rental company &lt;a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/" target="new"&gt;SnappCar&lt;/a&gt; saying it would allow car owners to &lt;a href="https://www.theconnectedcar.com/author.asp?section_id=627&amp;amp;doc_id=739273" target="new"&gt;track their vehicles&lt;/a&gt; when they're rented it out to a user of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And vehicle security is about to take another significant step forward. At this year's CES trade show, &lt;a href="http://www.gentex.com/" target="new"&gt;Gentex&lt;/a&gt; is prepared to reveal a slate of new technology, one of which seems straight out of Minority Report: in-vehicle retina scans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"The driver's eyes are key to securing and customizing the in-vehicle, connected-car experience," Gentex CEO Steve Downing wrote in a &lt;a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/gentex-to-demonstrate-new-connected-car-biometrics-and-digital-rear-vision-technologies-at-ces-2018-20180102-00463" target="new"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "By knowing exactly who is behind the wheel, automakers can implement vehicle security, personalize the vehicle cabin, and secure access to cloud-based accounts, apps, and additional connected car services."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As Downing notes, the security advantages of this type of driver identification go beyond merely ensuring that authorized users are operating a vehicle. It can provide an additional layer of security for payment services at toll booths and gas stations. Its uses even extend into infotainment: Upon identifying a driver via a retinal scan, a connected car system could automatically implement their preferred settings for seat positioning, cabin temperature and music.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The mechanism that will trigger the retinal scan in equipped cars is slick. Once in the car, all a driver needs to do is look into the rearview mirror. Their presence will be detected, and the system will commence the scan that uses near-infrared emitters and an iris-scanning camera as hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The retina scanning is only one of the new features that Gentex plans to reveal at CES. HomeLink Connect is an app that allows drivers in to control radio-frequency devices like garage doors from their car. It can even allow them to control IoT devices like connected thermostats, lighting and security systems, all from the comfort of a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"By adding cloud-based wireless control to HomeLink's traditional [radio frequency] functionality, the feature stands to remain the industry's most versatile, reliable, and comprehensive in-vehicle home automation system," Downing noted. "It also opens the feature to new markets and new users by providing an ever-expanding number of use cases."&lt;/p&gt;</page_html>
