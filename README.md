# connected-cars-migrate

scripts to migrate connected-cars ASP app files to Wordpress

Work in progress:

This script pulls data from XML files and creates Wordpress posts and taxonomy
from a custom ASP application that generates the Connected Cars website.

* Converts HTML entities that XML does not recognise into hashtag format entities 
* XML must be corrected as anchor links are not always quoted, and target= clause not separated in some cases
* import creates entities
* a translator for the hashtag format entites is yet to be impleted
* project was suspended
